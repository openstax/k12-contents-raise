<h4>Cool Down Activity</h4>
<p>On the same coordinate grid:</p>
<ul>
<li> Partner A draws a vertical line, and Partner B draws a horizontal line. </li>
<li> Each partner labels their line with its equation in slope-intercept form. </li>
</ul>
<p>Pass your paper to your partner. Check your partner&rsquo;s graph and equation.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>The purpose of the discussion is to elicit conversation about equations of lines parallel or perpendicular to horizontal or vertical lines.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;What do you notice about the equations of vertical lines?&rdquo; (They are of the form \( x = a \).)</li>
<li>&ldquo;What do you notice about the equations of lines perpendicular to vertical lines?&rdquo; (They are of the form \( y = b \).)</li>
<li>&ldquo;What do you notice about the equations of horizontal lines?&rdquo; (They are of the form \( y = b \).)</li>
<li>&ldquo;What do you notice about the equations of lines perpendicular to horizontal lines?&rdquo; (They are of the form \( x = a \).)</li>
