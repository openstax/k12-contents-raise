<h4>Writing an Equation to Represent a Quadratic Function with Only One Solution</h4>
<p><strong>Identifying the Number of Zeros</strong></p>
<p>How many zeros does the graph of the function \(f(x) = x^2+ 5x &minus; 14\) have? How can you find out without graphing the function?</p>
<p>Let's find the <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">factored form</span> of the function and solve it.</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Set the function equal to 0.<br>
  \(x^2+ 5x &minus; 14 = 0\) </p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Find the factored form.<br>
  \((x + 7)(x &minus; 2) = 0\) </p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Set each factor equal to 0 and solve.<br>
  \(x = -7\) and \(x = 2\)</p>
<p>Since there are two solutions, we know that the function \(f(x) = x^2+ 5x &minus; 14\) will have zeros at \(x=-7\) and \(x=2\).</p>
<p>In other words, the \(x\)-intercepts of the function are \((-7, 0)\) and \((2, 0)\).</p>
<p>For any function, the number of solutions is equal to the number of zeros when graphed.</p>
<p><strong>Writing an Equation to Represent a Quadratic Function with One Solution</strong></p>
<p>We can also find a <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">quadratic function</span> if we know the zeros. For example, if we want to write a quadratic function that has one zero or one solution, we can start with a factored form of the function representing one zero or solution.</p>
<p>Any factored form of a function with a factor that repeats itself, such as \((x &minus; 3)(x &minus; 3)\), has only one solution or one zero.</p>
<p>We can graph the function \(f(x) = (x &minus; 3)(x &minus; 3)\) to check our prediction.</p>
<p>We know the solution is \(x=3\). Let's rewrite the function in <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">standard form</span>.</p>
<p>Factored form:<br>
  \(f(x) = (x &minus; 3)(x &minus; 3)\) </p>
<p>Multiply to find standard form:<br>
  \(f(x) = x^2&minus; 6x + 9\) </p>
<p>Now, we graph the function \(f(x) = x^2&minus; 6x + 9\).</p>

<p>The graph of the function has one zero at \(x=3\). The \(x\)-intercept of the function is \((3, 0)\). The equation is said to have a <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">double root</span> at this point.</p>
<p>So, our prediction was correct.</p>
