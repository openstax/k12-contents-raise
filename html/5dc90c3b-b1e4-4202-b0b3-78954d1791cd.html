<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Explain how a quadratic equation and its graph relate to a situation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the activities that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li> 7.14.1: Evaluating Quadratic Functions in the Real World </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you found the meaning of values in a frog&rsquo;s jump such as maximum height. </li>
</ul>
<li> 7.14.2: Interpreting a Functional Relationship Between Two Quantities </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you found values in a graph and interpreted their meanings based on the situation graphed. </li>
<li> 7.14.2: Self Check </li>
<li> 7.14.2: Additional Resources </li>
</ul>
<li> 7.14.3: Analyzing Functions Using Different Representations </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you compared the heights of two baseballs hit by using a graph of one baseball player and the function of another. </li>
<li> 7.14.3: Self Check </li>
<li> 7.14.3: Additional Resources </li>
</ul>
<li> 7.14.4: Using Quadratic Functions to Solve Problems </li>
<ul>
<li> In this optional activity, you determined the information you would need to answer questions about the launch of a toy rocket. </li>
</ul>
<li> 7.14.5: Identifying Key Features of Graphed Functions </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you used an equation to determine the zeros of an equation and the height from which a beach ball was thrown. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following practice:</p>
<ul>
<li> 7.14.6: Practice </li>
</ul>
