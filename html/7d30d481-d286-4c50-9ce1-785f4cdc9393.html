<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm-up introduces division by monomials. The first example shows a monomial divided by a monomial. The following exercises provide practice dividing binomials by monomials. Students will learn to simplify the division expressions by dividing the coefficients and using the Quotient Property for exponents on the variables.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Review the first example of monomial division as a class, \(-54a^6b^3 \div 9a^4b^2\). Ask students for answers before looking at the revealed content. Discuss each step of the division while monitoring for any student questions.</p>
<p>Allow students to work on exercises 1&ndash;3 individually. Before the exercises, review the following vocabulary with students to avoid confusion.</p>
<p><strong>divisor:</strong> A divisor is a value by which another value is to be divided.<br>
  <strong>dividend:</strong> A dividend is a value to be divided by another value.<br>
  <strong>quotient: </strong>A quotient is the result of a division problem.<br>
  <strong>remainder:</strong> A remainder is the amount left over when performing division. It is expressed as a fraction with the remainder value in the numerator and the divisor in the denominator.
</p>

<p>In this unit, remember to double click on mathematical expressions/equations to enlarge, if needed.</p> <br>

<p>Look at the division expression \(-54a^6b^3 \div 9a^4b^2\).</p>
<ol>
  <li>Rewrite the division expression as a fraction.</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer. Then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> <br>
  Fraction form: \(\frac{-54a^6b^3}{9a^4b^2}\)</p>
<ol start="2">
  <li>Since we have a monomial divided by a monomial, we can rewrite the fraction as a product of several fractions where the factors in the numerator and denominator &ldquo;match.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer. Then select the <strong>Solution </strong>button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong><br>
  \(\frac{-54}{9} \cdot \frac{a^6}{a^4} \cdot \frac{b^3}{b^2}\)</p>
<ol start="3">
  <li>Now we can simplify the fraction multiplication and use the Quotient Property to divide.</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer. Then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong><br>
  \(\frac{-54}{9} \cdot \frac{a^6}{a^4} \cdot \frac{b^3}{b^2} = -6 \cdot a^2 \cdot b\)<br>
  <br>
  So \(-54a^6b^3 \div 9a^4b^2 = -6a^2b\).

<p>For questions 4-6, divide a polynomial by a monomial. Divide each term of the polynomial by the monomial.</p>
<ol start="4">
  <li> Find the quotient: \((18x^3y-36xy^2) \div (-3xy)\). </li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer. Then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong><br>
  Step 1<br>
  Rewrite as a fraction.<br>
  \(\frac{18x^3y-36xy^2}{-3xy}\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Divide each term by the divisor.<br>
  \(\frac{18x^3y}{-3xy}-\frac{36xy^2}{-3xy}\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Simplify.<br>
  \(-6x^2+12y\)</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their interpretations of how to divide monomials. Emphasize the following points while considering this example: \(21x^5y^2 \div -3x^2y\).</p>
<ul>
  <li> Consider the coefficients and variables separately. To help ensure the division is done correctly, the expression can be written in an expanded form grouping common bases, \(\frac{21}{7} \cdot \frac{x^5}{x^3} \cdot \frac{y^2}{y}\). </li>
  <li> Divide the coefficients. \(\frac{21}{7}=3\) </li>
  <li> For the variables, divide using the Quotient Property for exponents.</li>
  <ul>
    <li> \(\frac{x^5}{x^3}=x^2\) </li>
    <li> \(\frac{y^2}{y}=y\) </li>
  </ul>
  <li> Multiply the coefficients and variables as found in the previous steps.</li>
  <ul>
    <li> \(3 \cdot x^2 \cdot y = 3x^2y\) </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
