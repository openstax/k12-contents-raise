<p>What is the average rate of change of the first 10 minutes of the race?</p>
<p>To find the average rate of change of the first 10 minutes of the race, you would look at the first data value on the table and the third data value on the table, since it corresponds to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Remember, the average rate of change formula is \(\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\), where \((b, f(b))\) typically represents your second data point and \((a, f(a))\) represents your first data point.</p>
<p>For this situation, it would be \(( 0, 0)\) or \(a=0\) and \(f(a) =0\) and \((10,1.86)\) or \(b= 10\) and \(f(b)=1.86\).</p>
<p>Substituting the points into the average rate of change formula results in the following:</p>
<p>\(\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\), which is \(\frac{1.86}{10}\) or 0.186 miles per minute.</p>
<p>Notice that the answer is positive and the points on the graph are higher each time.</p>
