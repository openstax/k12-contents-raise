<h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>
<div class="body">
<p>This lesson first reviews proportions and proportional relationships to segue into variation. Students will learn how to recognize direct variation situations. They will set up direct variation equations and work to find the constant of variation to apply the direct variation equation to solve problems.</p>
<p>In applications using direct variation, students will know the values of one pair of the variables and will be asked to find the equation that relates \( x \) and \( y \). Then they can use that equation to find values of \( y \) for other values of \( x \).</p>
