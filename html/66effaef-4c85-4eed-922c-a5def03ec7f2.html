<h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>
<p>This lesson first reviews proportions and proportional relationships to segue into variation. Students will learn how to recognize direct variation situations. They will set up direct variation equations and work to find the constant of variation to apply the direct variation equation to solve problems.</p>
<p>In applications using direct variation, students will know the values of one pair of the variables and will be asked to find the equation that relates \( x \) and \( y \). Then they can use that equation to find values of \( y \) for other values of \( x \).</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify variables and set up a direct variation proportion, given a description of a situation.</li>
  <li>Solve a direct variation proportion.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Set up and solve direct variation problems.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners </h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines. </p>
<ul>
  <li>A1(F) use accessible language and learn new and essential language in the process </li>
  <li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audio tape, video, DVD, and CD ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment </li>
  <li>A2(I) dem listening comprehension of increasingly complex spoken Eng by following directions, retelling or summarizing spoken messages, responding to questions and requests, collaborating with peers, and taking notes commensurate with content and grade-level needs </li>
  <li>A3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions </li>
  <li>A3(I) adapt spoken language appropriately for formal and informal purposes </li>
</ul>
<h4>Support for Building Character</h4>
<p>Throughout this unit, find ways to encourage and support students to work on cultivating their <strong>social intelligence</strong>.</p>
