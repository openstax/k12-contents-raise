<p>A &ldquo;word wall&rdquo; is an evolving collection of key terminology that we want students to recognize and, over time, integrate into their own mathematical discourse. For each unit, print out the word wall pages that relate to the unit to post in the classroom. The pages include verbal or visual representations (and sometimes calculations) that exemplify the terminology.</p>
<p>The following are vocabulary word wall resources from the Virginia Department of Education:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Grade 8 (<a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/de2c82a7d76696662d668bf79998a361a345126d" target="_blank">PDF</a>)</li>
  <li>Algebra I (<a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/8ed3aa68763498713b44d3c2e537ffe61b4755f0" target="_blank">PDF</a>)</li>
  <li>Algebra II (<a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/dbc318a04a52506f39486c37b647e96661c2bed8" target="_blank">PDF</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some teachers organize the pages by unit and leave them up the whole year. Other teachers prefer to rotate out old words with new ones throughout the course. For example, they might start the year reviewing relevant words from grade 8, such as those related to linear functions and solving equations, and introduce new words along with each lesson in unit one.</p>
