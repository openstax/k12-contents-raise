<h4>Interpret Slope and y-Intercept&nbsp;</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Many real-world applications are modeled by linear equations. Often, when a linear equation model uses real-world data, different letters are used for the variables, instead of using only x and y. The variable names remind us of what quantities are being measured.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The equation T = 1/4n + 40 is used to estimate the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, T, based on the number of cricket chirps, n, in one minute. The graph shows the relationship.</p>

<p><span>What do the slope and T-intercept represent?</span></p>
<p><span>Answer: The slope is &frac14; and represents that for every 4 chirps per minute, the temperature increases by 1 degree. The T- intercept means when there are zero chirps, the temperature is 40 degrees.</span></p>
