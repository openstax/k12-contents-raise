<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>The mathematical purpose of this activity is to use the correlation coefficient to describe the relationship between two variables. Students examine a pair of variables and a correlation coefficient to describe the relationship between the variables as strong or weak and as positive or negative. Students must reason abstractly and quantitatively (TEKS 1C and 1F) when they interpret the situation to describe the relationship.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Give students an example of the type of response expected by telling students: &ldquo;The cost of a package of light bulbs and the number of light bulbs in the package has a correlation coefficient value near 1. This means that these variables have a very strong, positive relationship. In other words, the price of the package is very closely related to the number of light bulbs in the package (strong relationship), and when one of the variables goes up, the other variable tends to go up, too (positive relationship).&rdquo;</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>For each situation, describe the relationship between the variables, based on the correlation coefficient. Make sure to mention whether there is a&nbsp;<strong>strong relationship</strong>&nbsp;or not as well as whether it is a&nbsp;<strong>positive relationship</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>negative relationship</strong>.</p>

  <li>Number of steps taken per day and number of kilometers walked per day. \(r = 0.92\)<br><br>
    <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.<br>
    There is a strong, positive relationship. An increase in the number of kilometers walked tends to go along with an increase in the number of steps taken per day.</li></p>

  <li>Temperature of a rubber band and distance the rubber band can stretch. \(r = 0.84\)<br><br>
    <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.<br>
    There is a strong, positive relationship. An increase in temperature tends to go along with an increase in the distance a rubber band can stretch.</p>

  <li>Car weight and distance traveled using a full tank of gas. \(r = - 0.86\)<br><br>
    <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.<br>
   There is a strong, negative relationship. An increase in the weight of a car tends to go along with a decrease in the distance it can travel on a full tank of gas.</p>

  <li>Average fat intake per citizen of a country and average cancer rate of a country. \(r = 0.73\)<br><br>
    <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.<br>
   There is a moderate positive relationship. An increase in the fat intake per citizen of a country tends to go along with an increase in the average cancer rate of a country, but it is not a strong relationship.</p>

  <li>Score on science exam and number of words written on the essay question. \(r = 0.28\)<br><br>
    <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.<br>
    There is a weak, positive relationship. An increase in the number of words written on the essay question tends to go along with an increase on the score for a science exam, but the relationship is weak.</p>

<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>

<p>A biologist is trying to determine if a group of dolphins is a new species of dolphin or if it is a new group of individuals within the same species of dolphin. The biologist measures the width (in millimeters) of the largest part of the skull, zygomatic width, and the length (in millimeters) of the snout, rostral length, of 10 dolphins from the same group of individuals.</p>

<p>The data appear to be linear, the equation of the line of best fit is \(y = 0.201 x + 110.806\), and the \(r\)-value is 0.201.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li>
        After checking the data, the biologist realizes that the first zygomatic width listed as 147 mm is an error. It is supposed to be 180 mm. Use technology to find the equation of a line of best fit and the correlation coefficient for the corrected data. What is the equation of the line of best fit and the correlation coefficient?<br><br>
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong>\(y = 0.693 x &minus; 18.373\) and \(r = 0.76\)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Compare the new equation of the line of best fit with the original. What impact did changing one data point have on the slope, \(y\)-intercept, and correlation coefficient on the line of best fit?<br><br>
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong>
        Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.<br>
        The slope increased, and the correlation coefficient got closer to 1. The \(y\)-intercept also changed significantly.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Why do you think that a weak positive association became a moderately strong association? Be prepared to show your reasoning.<br><br>
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong>
        Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.<br>
        I think it became moderately strong because the data point that was changed did not follow the roughly linear pattern of the other 9 data points, and when it was changed, it did follow the linear pattern more closely.</p>
    </li>
    <p>For questions 4—6, use technology to change the \(y\)-value for the first and second entries in the table.</p>
    <li>
      How does changing each point&rsquo;s \(y\)-value impact the correlation coefficient?<br><br>
       <p><strong>Answer: </strong>
       Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.<br>
       Changing the points to numbers well above or below the existing linear trend in the data makes the correlation coefficient get closer to zero.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Can you change two values to get the correlation coefficient closer to 1? Use data to support your answer.<br><br>
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong>
        Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.<br>
        I managed to get the \(r\)-value to 0.86 by changing the 2 values that appeared farthest from the line of best fit, \((272,184)\) and \((272,161)\), to values that are very close to the existing line of best fit, \((272,168)\) and \((272,168)\).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      By leaving&nbsp; (288,180), can you change a value to get the relationship to change from a positive one to a negative one? Use data to support or refute your answer.<br><br>
       <p><strong>Answer: </strong>
       Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.<br>
       By changing \((247,147)\) to \((247,1000)\), I was able to change the relationship to a negative one because the line of best fit had a negative slope, \(y = - 14.187 x + 4071.1\).</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>

  <p>The purpose of this discussion is for students to interpret the data based on the relationship between the two variables that they determined using the correlation coefficient.</p>
  <p>Ask:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&ldquo;Do these correlations make sense based on what you understand about these variables?&rdquo; (Yes, mostly. Walking more, for example, usually means you take more steps.)</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Based on the information here, does a greater fat intake cause cancer?&rdquo; (Not necessarily. There seems to be a link, but there are many other factors about countries with greater fat intake that might play a part.) Causal relationships are the focus of the next lesson, so it is okay for students to struggle with this question now.</li>
    <li>&ldquo;What does it mean for the relationship between the score on a science exam and the number of words written to be weak and positive?&rdquo; (It means that, in general, the exam score tended to increase as the number of words written increased, but the relationship between these two variables was weak. This makes sense because if you wrote very few words, you probably would not get a good score, but writing lots of words does not necessarily guarantee you a good score.)</li>
  </ul>
