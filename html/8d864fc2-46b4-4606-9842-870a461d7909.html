<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>The equations \(y=x^2+6x+8\) and \(y=(x+2)(x+4)\) both define the same quadratic function.&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Without graphing, identify the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph. Explain how you know.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \((-2,0)\),\((-4,0)\); The constants in the factors of an equation in factored form give a clue about where the \(x\)-intercepts are when the equation is graphed. In the equation \(y=(x+2)(x+4)\), the \(x\)-intercepts are \((-2,0)\) and \((-4,0)\).
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Without graphing, identify the \(y\)-value of the \(y\)-intercept of the graph. Be prepared to show your reasoning.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;8; The \(y\)-intercepts of the graph can be seen when the equation is in standard form. The \(y\)-coordinate is the number without the variable. In the equation \(y=x^2+6x+8\), it is the 8 so the \(y\)-intercept is \((0,8)\).

<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons, in order to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
