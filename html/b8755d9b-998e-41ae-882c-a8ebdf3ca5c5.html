<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>This info gap activity gives students an opportunity to
  use their understanding of systems of linear inequalities to solve problems that involve satisfying
  multiple constraints simultaneously.</p>
<p>The info gap structure requires students to make sense of
  problems and persevere in solving them (MP1). Students need to determine what information is necessary to solve a problem, ask
  for the information, and then explain their request. This may take several
  rounds of discussion if their first requests do not yield the information they
  need. It also allows them to refine the language they use and ask increasingly precise questions until they get the information they need (MP6).
</p>
<p>Students may approach the problems in different ways,
  including by guessing and checking, but the problems can be efficiently solved
  by writing and solving systems of linear inequalities.
</p>
<p>Every clue given in a data card can be written as an
  inequality. If \(x\) is the number of children on a team and \(y\) the number of
  adults, the clue &ldquo;a team with only adults is not allowed&rdquo; can be
  expressed as \(x&gt;0\), and &ldquo;a team without adults is allowed&rdquo; can be
  expressed as \(y\geq0\). But because other membership rules are
  more restrictive, and because thinking only about positive values of \(x\) and \(y\) is
  natural in this situation, it is not essential for these constraints to be
  represented. (The blank coordinate planes provided also show only the first
  quadrant, implying positive solutions.)</p>
<p>In an upcoming lesson, students will look more closely at
  the inequalities \(x&gt;0\) and \(y&gt;0\).</p>
<p>Here
  is the text of the cards for reference and planning:</p>

<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Explain the info gap structure and consider demonstrating the protocol if students are unfamiliar with it.<br><br>Arrange students in groups of 2. In each group, distribute a problem card to one student and a data card to the other student. After reviewing their work on the first problem, give them the cards for a second problem and instruct them to switch roles.<br><br>Because this activity was designed to be completed without technology, ask students to put away any devices.
</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Your teacher will give you either a problem card or a data card. Do not show or read your card to your partner.</p>
<p>If your teacher gives you the data card:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Silently read the information on your card.</li>
  <li>Ask your partner, &ldquo;What specific information do you need?&rdquo; and wait for your partner to ask for information. Only give information that is on your card. (Do not figure out anything for your partner!)</li>
  <li>Before telling your partner the information, ask, &ldquo;Why do you need to know (that piece of information)?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Read the problem card and solve the problem independently.</li>
  <li>Share the data card and discuss your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your teacher gives you the problem card:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Silently read your card and think about what information you need to answer the question.</li>
  <li>Ask your partner for the specific information that you need.</li>
  <li>Explain to your partner how you are using the information to solve the problem.</li>
  <li>When you have enough information, share the problem card with your partner, and solve the problem independently.</li>
  <li>Read the data card and discuss your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pause here so your teacher can review your work. Ask your teacher for a new set of cards and repeat the activity, trading roles with your partner.</p>

<p>1. Use the graphing tool or technology outside the course to help you determine the correct solution. (Students were provided access to Desmos.) </p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Card 1:</strong></p>
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
      <li>No. The combination meets the rule about the total number of members, but does not meet the rule about the number of adults compared to the number of students. For example:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The point (8,6) is not in the shaded region of the graph representing the rule about children-to-adult ratio.      </li>
          <li>If 6 is substituted into the inequality representing the rule about children-to-adult ratio and then evaluated, the inequality, \(6 &le; \frac12 (8)\), is a false statement. </li>
        </ul>
      <li>The maximum number of adults is 5.</li>
    </ol> 
  <p><strong>Card 2:</strong></p>
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li>Each team can have at least 8 people: 6 children and 2 adults. For example: The region where all three graphs overlap represent combinations that meet all three rules. The lowest numbers of children and adults in the region are 6 and 2. </li>
    <li>The maximum number of adults on a team is 5.</li>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students in both roles may wonder if all clues on the data card
  constitute a &ldquo;rule.&rdquo; Those holding a data card may not know how to
  respond if or when asked, &ldquo;What is the first rule?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What is
  one of the rules?&rdquo; Those who are asking for information may not know if
  what is given counts as a rule. Clarify that a rule should be general enough to
  include multiple possibilities, rather than just one specific case. For
  example, &ldquo;If there are 3 adults, there must be at least 6 children&rdquo; is a specific case, rather than a general constraint.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students who solved the problems by graphing a system of
  inequalities to share their graphs and their thinking, or display the following
  graphs.<br><br>Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Which membership rule
    does each shaded region on the graphs represent?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Can all the clues be
    written as inequalities? If so, what are they?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Should we graph them
    all? Why or why not?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How does the first set
    of graphs help us answer questions about whether 6 adults and 8 children are
    acceptable?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How do they tell us
    about the maximum allowable number of adults on a team?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How does the second set
    of graphs help us find the minimum number of team members and the composition
    of the team?&rdquo;</li>

<p><strong>The following content is available to students who would like more support based on their experience with the self check. Students will not automatically have access to this content, so you may wish to share it with those who could benefit from it.&nbsp;</strong><br/></p>

<h4>Solve Applications of Systems of Inequalities</h4>
<p>When we use variables other than \(x\) and \(y\)&nbsp;to define an unknown quantity, we must change the names of the axes of the graph as well.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
Use the following information to answer questions 1-4.</p>
<blockquote><p>Omar needs to eat at least 800 calories before going to his team practice. All he wants is hamburgers, \(h\), and cookies, \(c\), and he doesn&rsquo;t want to spend more than $5. At the hamburger restaurant near his college, each hamburger has 240 calories and costs $1.40. Each cookie has 160 calories and costs $0.50.</p></blockquote>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Write a system of inequalities to model this situation.<br><br>
  <strong>Solution</strong><br>
    Let \(h\) equal the number of hamburgers.<br>
     Let \(c\) equal the number of cookies.<br><br>
     To find the system of equations, translate the information.<br>
   </li>
      <ul  type="none">
        <li>The calories from hamburgers at 240 calories each, plus the calories from cookies at 160 calories each must be more than 800.<br>
            \(240h+160c&geq;800\)</li><br>
        <li>The amount spent on hamburgers at $1.40 each, plus the amount spent on cookies at $0.50 each must be no more than $5.00.<br>
            \(1.40h+0.50c&le;5\)</li><br>
        <li>The number of hamburgers must be greater than or equal to 0.<br>
          \(h&geq;0\)<br><br>
          The number of cookies must be greater than or equal to 0. <br>
            \(c&geq;0\)<br><br></li>
        <li>We have our system of equations.<br><br>
          \(\left\{\begin{array}{l}240h\;+\;160c\;\geq\;800\\1.40h\;+0.50c\;\leq\;5\\h\;\geq\;0\\c\;\geq\;0\end{array}\right.\) </li>
      </ul>
  <br>
  <li>Graph the system.<br><br>
  <strong>Solution</strong><br>
  Since \(h&geq;0\) and \(c&geq;0\) all solutions will be in the first quadrant. As a result, our graph shows only quadrant one.<br><br>
    <ul  type="none">
        <li>To graph \(240h+160c&geq;80\), graph \(240h+160c=800\) as a solid line. Choose \((0,0)\) as a test point. Since it does not make the inequality true, shade (red) the side that does not include the point \((0,0)\).<br><br>
          <img alt="graph of 240h+160c is greater than or equal to 800 and graph of 1.40h +0.50c is less than or equal to 5" class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="389" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/a33241cd08b3ea9848101b3823e7dcf56f94a8ac" width="382">  
        </li>
        <li>Graph \(1.40h+0.50c&leq;5\).<br>
          The boundary line is \(1.40h+0.50c=5\).<br> We test \((0, 0)\) and it makes the inequality true.<br>
          We shade the side of the line that includes \((0, 0)\).<br><br>
        The solution of the system is the region of the graph that is shaded the darkest. The boundary line sections that border the darkly shaded section are included in the solution as are the points on the \(x\)-axis from \((5, 0)\) to \((10, 0)\).   
        </li>
    </ul>
  </li>  <br>
  <li>Could he eat 3 hamburgers and 1 cookie?<br><br>
    <strong>Solution</strong><br> 
    To determine if 3 hamburgers and 1 cookie would meet Omar&rsquo;s criteria, we see if the point \((3, 2)\) is in the solution region.<br>
    It is, so Omar might choose to eat 3 hamburgers and 1 cookie.</li><br>
  <li>Could he eat 2 hamburgers and 4 cookies?<br><br>
    <strong>Solution</strong><br> 
    To determine if 2 hamburgers and 4 cookies would meet Omar&rsquo;s criteria, we see if the point \((2, 4)\) is in the solution region.<br>
    It is, so Omar might choose to eat 2 hamburgers and 4 cookies.&nbsp;<br><br>
    We could also test the possible solutions by substituting the values into each inequality.
  </li>
</ol>           
<h4>Try It: Solve Applications of Systems of Inequalities</h4>
<p>Use the following information for questions 1-4.<br>
  <blockquote>Philip&rsquo;s doctor tells him he should add at least 1,000 more calories per day to his usual diet. Philip wants to buy protein bars, \(p\), that cost $1.80 each and have 140 calories and juice, \(j\), that costs $1.25 per bottle and has 125 calories.
