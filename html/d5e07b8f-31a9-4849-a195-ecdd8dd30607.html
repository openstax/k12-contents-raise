<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain why some algebraic moves create equivalent equations but some do not.</li>
<li>Illustrate that dividing by a variable is not used in solving equations because it can lead to equations that have fewer solutions than the original equation.</li>
<li>Demonstrate that equations that are not true for any value of the variable(s) do not have solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.7.1: Determining if Zero Is a Solution&nbsp;<ul>
<li>In this activity, you substituted 0 into equations to determine for which equations 0 was a solution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1.7.2: Explaining Acceptable Moves Used to Solve an Equation<ul>
<li>In this activity, you learned how acceptable moves applied to an equation can create an equivalent equation. Through these discussions you had the opportunity to construct logical arguments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1.7.2: Self Check</li>
<li>1.7.3: Equations with No Solution or Infinitely Many<ul>
<li>In this activity, you explored why equations may not have a solution and if the moves made to solve the equations were acceptable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1.7.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>
<li>1.7.4: Solving Equations by Dividing Values<ul>
<li>In this activity, you used division to find equivalent equations and also learned that you can not divide by 0.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
