<p>In this lesson, you will construct quadratic functions to represent various situations, investigate the movement of free-falling objects, analyze the vertical distances that falling objects travel over time, and see that they can be described by quadratic functions.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Explain the meaning of the terms in a quadratic expression that represents the height of a falling object. </li>
  <li> Use tables, graphs, and equations to represent the height of a falling object. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>

  </ul>
  <li> 7.5.4: A Quadratic Expression that Represents the Relationship Between Distance and Time </li>
</ul>
<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>
