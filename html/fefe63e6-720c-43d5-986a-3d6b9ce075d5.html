<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students examine graphs of functions, identify and describe their key features, and connect these features to the situations represented. These key features include the horizontal and vertical intercepts, maximums and minimums, and intervals where a function is increasing or decreasing (or where a graph has a positive or a negative slope).</p>
<p>Neither the features nor the terms are likely new to students. The idea of intercepts was introduced in middle school and further developed in earlier units. Graphical features such as maximums and minimums have been considered intuitively in various cases. They are simply more precisely defined here. In a later activity, students will distinguish between a maximum of a graph and the maximum of a function.</p>

  <p>Use this routine to help students interpret a situation to identify the key features of a graph. Display the student task statement and graphs, without the questions. Ask students to write down possible mathematical questions that could be asked about the situation. Invite students to compare their questions before revealing the activity&rsquo;s questions. Listen for and amplify any questions involving the behavior of the toy rocket and drone, or questions about features or places on the graph that show important information about each object&rsquo;s movement. This will help students produce the language of key features of graphs of functions, such as maximum, minimum, and intervals.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>A toy rocket and a drone were launched at the same time.</p>
<p>Here are the graphs that represent the heights of two objects as a function of time since they were launched.</p>
<p>Height is measured in meters above the ground, and time is measured in seconds since launch.</p>
<p><img alt="2 graphs. Horizontal axis, 0 to 7, time in seconds. Vertical axis, 0 to 50 by 10&rsquo;s, height in meters. Graph R is a parabolic and opens down. Graph D is piecewise linear." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/381549c4047fb4e339394723978be30242415483"></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Analyze the graph of the toy rocket and describe as precisely as you can what was happening. Your description should be complete and precise enough that someone who is not looking at the graph could visualize how the object was behaving. Include where the toy rocket starts and when it stops.</li>
  <p> <strong>ANSWER: </strong> The toy rocket was launched from a height of 25 meters above ground. It went up quickly, but it slowed down and then stopped getting higher when it reached 45 meters, which was 2 seconds after launch. At that point, it started to come back down. It hit the ground 5 seconds after it was launched.</p>
  <li>Analyze the graph of the drone and describe as precisely as you can what was happening. Your description should be complete and precise enough that someone who is not looking at the graph could visualize how the object was behaving. Include where the drone starts and when it stops.</li>
  <p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>The drone took off from the ground. It went up at a constant speed for 2 seconds, up to a height of 20 meters. Then, it hovered at that height for 3 seconds. Afterward, it started descending at a constant speed for 2 seconds. It landed back on the ground 7 seconds after launch.</p>
  <li>At what point were the drone and the toy rocket at the same height?&nbsp;</li>
  <p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>A little after 4 seconds, the drone and the toy rocket were at the same height (20 meters).</p>
  <li>Which parts or features of the graphs show important information about each object&rsquo;s movement? List the features or mark them on the graphs.</li>
  <p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>Sample Responses:</p>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>the points where the graphs begin (when \(t\) is 0)</li>
  <li>the points where the graphs cross the horizontal axis</li>
  <li>the point where the graphs change direction</li>
  <li>the shape of each graph (curved or straight)</li>
  <li>the intervals when the graphs behave certain ways</li>
  <li>the parts highlighted in the graph</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Two nonlinear functions. time in seconds and height in meters." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/7560ec4450ed8d216a5e4c60ddd2b3e9a325465a"></p>
</ol>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>When analyzing the graphs and describing what is happening with each object, some students may mistakenly think that the horizontal axis represents horizontal distance, neglecting to notice that it represents time. They may then describe how the objects were moving vertically as they traveled horizontally, rather than with respect to the number of seconds since they took off. Encourage these students to check the label of each axis and revisit their descriptions.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select a few students to share their description of the graphs, and have each student describe the motion of one flying object.</p>
<p>Display a blank coordinate plane for all to see. As each student shares their response, sketch a graph to match what is being described.</p>
<p><img alt="Blank graph. time in seconds and height in meters." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/ee4879a70fe83dfbac4ebb223e41df8d6cb259b0"></p>
<p>For any gaps in their description, make assumptions and sketch accordingly. (For example, if a student states that the toy rocket reaches a height of 45 meters after 2 seconds but does not state its starting height, start the curve at \((0,0)\), \((0,40)\), or any other point besides \((0,25)\).) If requested, allow students to refine their descriptions and adjust the sketch accordingly.</p>
<p>Next, invite other students to share their response to the last question. On the graphs, highlight the features students noted. (See Student Response for an example.) Use the terms &ldquo;vertical intercepts,&rdquo; &ldquo;horizontal intercepts,&rdquo; &ldquo;maximum,&rdquo; and &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; to refer to those features and label them on the graphs.</p>
<p>Explain to students that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A point on the graph that is as high as or higher than all other points is called a maximum of the graph (or a relative maximum because its height is viewed in relation to other points shown on the graph).</li>
  <li>A point on the graph that is as low as or lower than all other points is called a minimum of the graph (or a relative minimum).</li>
</ul>
<p>A graph could have more than one relative maximum or minimum. For instance, the points \((2,(D(2))\) and \((5,D(5))\) are both relative maximums, and \((0,D(0))\) and \((7,D(7))\) are both relative minimums.</p>
<p>If no students mentioned the intervals in which each function was increasing, staying constant, or decreasing, draw their attention to these features on the graphs and label them as such.</p>

<h4>Real-Life Graphs of Functions</h4>
<p>A ball is bouncing across the school yard. The vertical or \(y\)-axis represents the height of the ball in feet, \(h(t)\), while the horizontal or \(x\)-axis represents the time, \(t\), that has passed in seconds.</p>
<p><img alt="GRAPH THAT SHOWS THE HEIGHT OF A BALL IN FEET AS A FUNCTION OF TIME IN SECONDS WITH A Y-INTERCEPT OF 0 AND X-INTERCEPTS OF 0 AND 1.

<p>On the graph, \(t=0\) represents the first time the ball touches the ground.</p>
<p>What is \(h(1)\), and what does it represent in the context of the problem?</p>
<p>\(h(1) = 0\), and it represents the height of the ball after 1 second, or the ball has a height of zero after 1 second. The value inside of the parentheses is the value from the \(x\)-axis or horizontal axis. The solution is the value of the graph at that point.</p>

<p>A ball is thrown across the field from point \(A\) to point \(B\). It hits the ground at point \(B\). The path of the ball is shown in the diagram below. The \(x\)-axis shows the horizontal distance the ball travels in feet, and the&nbsp;\(y\)-axis shows the height of the ball in feet.</p>
