<p>What is the pattern that you used in the previous activity to find the number of moves depending on the number of checkers?</p>
<p>Each row is multiplied by 1 more, so:</p>
<p>\(1\cdot3=3\)</p>
<p>\(2\cdot4=8\)</p>
<p>\(3\cdot5=15\)</p>
<p>\(4\cdot6=24\)</p>
<p>How many moves are needed with 5 checkers?</p>
<p>\(5\cdot7=35\) moves</p>
<p>What about 6 checkers?</p>
<p>\(6\cdot8=48\) moves</p>

  <p>Here is how to solve this problem using a general strategy:</p>
  <p>The next column in the table had 7 checkers and then multiplied 7 by 9 to get 63 moves.</p>
  <p>Next, the 8 would need to be multiplied by 10, so:</p>
  <p>\(8\cdot10=80\)</p>
  <p>80 moves are needed.</p>
