<ol>
  <li>Here are graphs of functions \(f\) and \(g\).</li>
</ol>
<p>Each represents the height of an object being launched into the air as a function of time.</p>
<p><img alt="Graphs of functions f and g. Vertical axis, height. Horizontal axis, time. Function f begins low on the y axis, increases in height quickly, then ends at about halfway down the x axis. Function g begins high on the y axis, moves gradually downward, and ends toward the end of the x axis." height="184" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c2fb42c0f8f727ba961e42c44dcb9437c595eeeb" width="284"></p>
<ol>
  <ol type="a">
    <li> Which object was launched from a higher point?
      <ul>
        <li> The object represented by function \(f\) </li>
        <li> The object represented by function \(g\) </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol><br>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> The object represented by function \(g\) because its \(y\)-intercept is above the \(y\)-intercept of the graph of \(f\).</p>
</ol>
<ol>
  <ol start="2" type="a">
    <li> Which object reached a higher point?
      <ul>
        <li> The object represented by function \(f\) </li>
        <li> The object represented by function \(g\) </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol><br>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> The object represented by function \(f\) because the vertex is higher.</p>
</ol>
<ol>
  <ol start="3" type="a">
    <li> Which object was launched with the greater upward velocity?
      <ul>
        <li> The object represented by function \(f\) </li>
        <li> The object represented by function \(g\) </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol><br>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> The object represented by function \(f\) because the &ldquo;slope&rdquo; near the \(y\)-intercept is greater. It increases in height much more quickly than the other object.</p>
</ol>
<ol>
  <ol start="4" type="a">
    <li> Which object landed last?
      <ul>
        <li> The object represented by function \(f\) </li>
        <li> The object represented by function \(g\) </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol><br>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> The object represented by function \(g\) because the positive \(x\)-intercept of its graph is to the right of the positive \(x\)-intercept of the graph of \(f\).</p>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
  <li>The function \(h\) given by \(h(t)=(1&minus;t)(8+16t)\) models the height of a ball in feet, \(t\) seconds after it was thrown.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
  <ol type="a">
    <li> Find one of the zeros of the functions using \((8+16t)\). </li>
  </ol><br>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> -0.5. From the factored form, we can tell that the graph intersects the horizontal axis at \(t=-0.5\). The zero of the function is the same value.</p>
</ol>
<ol>
  <ol start="2" type="a">
    <li> Find one of the zeros of the functions using \((1-t)\). </li>
  </ol><br>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> 1. From the factored form, we can tell that the graph intersects the horizontal axis at \((1-t)\). The zero of the function is the same value.</p>
</ol>
<ol>
  <ol start="3" type="a">
    <li> What do the zeros tell us in this situation?
      <ul>
        <li> The positive zero means the time, in seconds, when the basketball is on the ground or hits the ground. </li>
        <li> The negative zero represents the height, in feet, when the time is zero. </li>
        <li> The positive zero represents the time, in seconds, when the basketball reaches the maximum height. </li>
        <li> The negative zero represents the time, in seconds, when the basketball is on the ground or hits the ground. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol><br>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> The positive zero means the time, in seconds, when the basketball is on the ground or hits the ground.</p>
</ol>
<ol>
  <ol start="4" type="a">
    <li> Are both zeros meaningful?
      <ul>
        <li> Yes </li>
        <li> No </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol><br>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> No. Only the positive zero is meaningful. It tells us the ball hits the ground after 1 second.</p>
</ol>
<ol>
  <ol start="5" type="a">
    <li> From what height, in feet, is the ball thrown? </li>
  </ol><br>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> 8 feet. When \((1&minus;t)(8+16t)\)is rewritten in standard form it is \(8+8t&minus;16t^2\). The constant term (which corresponds to the \(y\)-intercept) tells us the height of the basketball when \(t=0\) or when it is launched.</p>
</ol>
<ol>
  <ol start="6" type="a">
    <li> When, in seconds, does the ball reach its highest point? </li>
  </ol><br>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> 0.25 seconds. Graphing \(h\) shows the maximum point at \((0.25,9)\). Or, you could recognize that 0.25 is the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex because it is halfway between the two zeros, -0.5 and 1.</p>
</ol>
<ol>
  <ol start="7" type="a">
    <li> How high, in feet, does the ball go? </li>
  </ol><br>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> 9 feet. Graphing \(h\) shows the maximum point at \((0.25,9)\). Or, you could recognize that 0.25 is the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex because it is halfway between the two zeros, -0.5 and 1. Then evaluate the function at 0.25 to get a height of 9.</p>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
  <li>The height in feet of a thrown football is modeled by the equation \(f(t)=6+30t&minus;16t^2\), where time \(t\) is measured in seconds.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
  <ol type="a">
    <li> Which term in the equation describes how many feet above the ground the football was thrown?
      <ul>
        <li> The constant term 6 </li>
        <li> The linear term \(30t\) </li>
        <li> The squared term \(-16t^2\) </li>
        <li> The squared term \(16t^2\) </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol><br>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> The constant term 6</p>
</ol>
<ol>
  <ol start="2" type="a">
    <li> Which term in the equation describes the initial upward velocity of the football in feet per second?
      <ul>
        <li> The constant term 6 </li>
        <li> The linear term \(30t\) </li>
        <li> The squared term \(-16t^2\) </li>
        <li> The squared term \(16t^2\) </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol><br>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> The linear term \(30t\).</p>
</ol>
<ol>
  <ol start="3" type="a">
    <li> How does the squared term \(-16t^2\) affect the value of the function \(f\)? </li>
  </ol><br>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> The squared term decreases the value of the function because the values of \(16t^2\) are being subtracted from \(6+30t\)</p>
</ol>
<ol>
  <ol start="4" type="a">
    <li> What does this term \(&minus;16t^2\) reveal about the situation?
      <ul>
        <li> The influence of gravity pulling the ball down to the ground. </li>
        <li> The initial upward velocity of the football. </li>
        <li> How far the football was thrown above the ground. </li>
        <li> How long the ball is in the air before it hits the ground. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol><br>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> The influence of gravity pulling the ball down to the ground.</p>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
  <li>The height in feet of an arrow is modeled by the equation \(h(t)=(1+2t)(18&minus;8t)\), where \(t\) is seconds after the arrow is shot.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
  <ol type="a">
    <li> At what time, in seconds, does the arrow hit the ground? </li>
  </ol><br>
  <p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>2.25. The positive zero is 2.25 because \((18&minus;8t)\) is equal to zero when \(t=2.25\). The zeros mean the times, in seconds, when the arrow is on the ground. Only the positive zero makes sense. The negative zero would represent a time before the arrow was launched.</p>
</ol>
<ol>
  <ol start="2" type="a">
    <li> At what height, in feet, is the arrow shot? </li>
  </ol><br>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> 18 feet. When the arrow is shot, \(t\) is 0 and \(h(0)=(1+2&sdot;0)(18&minus;8&sdot;0)=(1)(18)=18\).</p>
</ol>
<p>5. Two objects are launched into the air.</p>
<p>The height, in feet, of Object A is given by the equation \(f(t)=4+32t&minus;16t^2\).</p>
<p>The height, in feet, of Object B is given by the equation \(g(t)=2.5+40t&minus;16^2\).</p>
<p>In both functions, \(t\) is seconds after launch.</p>
<ol>
  <ol type="a">
    <li> Which object was launched from a greater height?
      <ul>
        <li> Object A </li>
        <li> Object B </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol><br>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Object A. The objects are launched when \(t=0\). \(f(0)=4+32&sdot;0&minus;16(0)2=4\) and \(g(0)=2.5+40&sdot;0&minus;16(0)2=2.5\).</p>
</ol>
<ol>
  <ol start="2" type="a">
    <li> Which object was launched with a greater upward velocity?
      <ul>
        <li> Object A </li>
        <li> Object B </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol><br>
  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Object B. The coefficient of \(t\) gives the upward velocity and 40 is greater than 32.</p>
