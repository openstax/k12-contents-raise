<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm up encourages students to quantify the number of squares in a geometric pattern by looking for and making use of structure. The thinking involved here prepares students to reason about other patterns that illustrate quadratic relationships.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Give students 2&ndash;3 minutes of quiet think time, and then ask them to share their thinking with their partner.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>How does each expression represent the number of small squares in the figure?</p>
<p><img alt="An image of a block of squares. There are eight squares on rows 1, 2, 3 and 4 and five squares on rows 5 and 6.

<ol>
  <li>Expression A: \(6 \cdot 8&minus;2 \cdot 3\)<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> There are 6 rows with 8 small squares, but from this, 2 rows of 3 small squares have been removed.
  </li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
  <li>Expression B: \(4 \cdot 8+2 \cdot 5\)<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> There are 4 rows of 8 small squares, and to this, 2 rows of 5 small squares are added.
  </li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
  <li>Expression C: \(8+8+8+8+5+5\)<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> This counts each row, starting from the bottom.
  </li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
  <li>Expression D: \(5 \cdot 6+3 \cdot 4\)<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> There are 5 columns of 6 small squares and 3 columns of 4 small squares.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Make sure students see how each expression tells us about a way the squares can be counted or how the area of the figure can be determined. If time permits, ask students if they could generate a different expression that also represents the number of squares in the figure.</p>
