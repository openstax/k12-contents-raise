<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity gives students an opportunity to practice solving quadratic equations and deciding on an effective strategy. Some equations can be easily solved by reasoning. Others would require solving by graphing because students have not yet learned the strategies to solve algebraically. Students who use graphing technology only when needed practice choosing tools strategically.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students to share their solutions and strategies. If not mentioned by students' explanations, highlight that:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> The first three equations, as well as the equation \((x+1)^2=-4\), can be solved by reasoning, and graphing is not necessary. </li>
<li> The last three equations can be solved by graphing. There are two ways to do so, as shown in a previous activity. </li>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> One way is to graph each side of the equation separately: \(y\) = <em>expression</em> on one side and \(y\) = <em>number</em> on the other side. </li>
<li> Another way is to rearrange the equation such that it is in the form of <em>expression</em> \(= 0\), graph \(y\) = <em>expression</em>, and then find the \(x\)-intercepts. </li>
</ul>
<li> The equation \((x+1)^2=-4\) states that some number squared is &ndash;4. Because no number can be squared to get a negative number, we can reason that there are no solutions. If this equation is solved by graphing \(y=(x+1)^2+4\), the graph would show no \(x\)-intercepts. This also tells us that there are no solutions. </li>
</ul>

<p>Incorrect. Let's try again a different way: This equation is best solved by graphing. Graph the equation \(y=(x&minus;6)(x+5)+30.25\). There is one \(x\)-intercept at \((0.5,0)\). The answer is \(x=0.5\).</p>

<p>\(x=0.5\)</p>
</td>

<p>That's correct! Check yourself: This equation is best solved by graphing. Substitute 0.5 in for \(x\) and check to see if the equation is true. \((0.5&minus;6)(0.5+5)=-30.25\). Since the equation is true, 0.5 is correct.</p>

<h4>Choosing an Effective Strategy to Solve Quadratic Equations</h4>
<p>You have learned various strategies to solve quadratic equations in different forms. If possible, try to use reasoning before graphing an equation.</p>
<p>Let's look at some examples.</p>
<p><strong>Using Reasoning and the Square Root Property</strong></p>
<p>Equations such as these can be solved by reasoning and using the square root property.</p>
<p>Example 1<br>
  \(x^2=81\) <br>
  \(x=9\) and \(x=-9\) </p>
<p>Example 2 <br>
  \(x^2+7=56\)<br>
  \(x^2=49\)<br>
  \(x=7\) and \(x=-7\)</p>
<p>Example 3<br>
  \((x+1)^2=9\)<br>
  \(x=2\) and \(x=-4\)</p>
<p>Each equation above is different in some way, but they all can be solved using the same process.</p>
<p><strong>Using Reasoning and the Zero Product Property</strong></p>
<p>Equations such as these can be solved by reasoning and using the zero product property.</p>
<p>Example 1<br>
  \((x&minus;4)(x+5)=0\)<br>
  \(x=4\) and \(x=-5\)</p>
<p>Example 2<br>
  \((x+3)(2x+7)=0\)<br>
  \(x=-3\) and \(x=-\frac{7}{2}\)</p>
<p><strong>Using Graphing to Solve</strong></p>
<p>Some equations might require graphing to be solved. One method is to rearrange the equation such that it is in the form of <em>expression</em> \(= 0\). Then graph \(y\) = <em>expression</em>, and find the \(x\)-intercepts to identify the solutions.</p>
<p>Given: \((x+2)(x&minus;1)=4\)</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Rewrite the equation to set it equal to 0.<br>
  \((x+2)(x&minus;1)&minus;4=0\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Graph the equation with \(y\) = the expression that equals zero.<br>
  Graph \(y=(x+2)(x&minus;1)&minus;4\).</p>
<p><img alt="GRAPH OF A PARABOLA THAT OPENS UP AND PASSES THROUGH THE POINTS (NEGATIVE 3, 0) AND (2, 0)." height="481" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/90d204f34d4adb7110ea356ebca909d5638c2b25" width="481"></p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Identify the \(x\)-intercepts from the graph.<br>
  This graph has two \(x\)-intercepts at \((-3,0)\) and \((2,0)\).</p>
<p>The original equation \((x+2)(x&minus;1)=4\) has two solutions at \(x=-3\) and \(x=2\).</p>
