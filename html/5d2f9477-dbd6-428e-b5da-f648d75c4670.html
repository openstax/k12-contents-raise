<p><strong><em>Students will complete the following questions to practice the skills they have learned in this lesson.</em></strong></p>
<p>For questions 1 - 4, use the following scenario.
</p>
<blockquote>The relationship between the amount of time a car is parked, in hours, and the cost of parking, in dollars, can be described with a function.</blockquote>
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
      <li>Identify the independent variable in this function.<br>
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong> The independent variable is the amount of time the car is parked.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Identify the dependent variable in this function.
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong> The dependent variable is the cost of parking.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Describe the function with a sentence of the form &ldquo;____ is a function of ____.&rdquo;
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong> <u>The cost of parking</u> is a function of <u>the amount of time a car is parked</u>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Suppose it costs $3 per hour to park, with a maximum cost of $12.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
<p>Here is a graph of the situation:</p>

<p>What does the point \((2,6)\) mean in this situation?</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>2 hours of parking costs $6.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>The distance a person walks, \(d\), in kilometers, is a function of time, \(t\), in minutes, since the walk began.</li>
</ol>
<p>Select the <strong>two statements</strong> about the input variable of this function that are true.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="A">
  <li>Distance is the input.</li>
  <li>Time of day is the input.</li>
  <li>Time since the person started walking is the input.</li>
  <li>\(t\) represents the input.</li>
  <li>\(d\) represents the input.</li>
  <li>The input is not measured in any particular unit.</li>
  <li>The input is measured in hours.</li>
  <li>For each input, there are sometimes two outputs.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Time since the person started walking is the input; \(t\) represents the input.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
  <li>Is the following relation a function?</li>
</ol>
<p>{\((27,&minus;3),(8,&minus;2),(1,&minus;1),(0,0),(1,1),(8,2),(27,3)\)}</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>No. Since the input value, 1, goes to both &ndash;1 and 1, this relation is not a function.</p>
<br>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="7">
  <li>Is the following relation a function? Explain your answer.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="This figure shows two table that each have one column. The table on the left has the header &ldquo;Name&rdquo; and lists the names &ldquo;Neal&rdquo;, &ldquo;Krystal&rdquo;, &ldquo;Kelvin&rdquo;, &ldquo;George&rdquo;, &ldquo;Christa&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Mike&rdquo;. The table on the right has the header &ldquo;Phone number&rdquo; and lists the numbers &ldquo;123-567-4389 work&rdquo;, &ldquo;231-378-5941 cell&rdquo;, &ldquo;753-469-9731 cell&rdquo;, &ldquo;567-534-2970 work&rdquo;, &ldquo;684-369-7231 cell&rdquo;, &ldquo;798-367-8541 cell&rdquo;, and &ldquo;639-847-6971 cell&rdquo;. There are arrows that start at a name and points toward a number in the phone number table. The first arrow goes from Neal to 753-469-9731 cell. The second arrow goes from Krystal to a 684-369-7231 cell. The third arrow goes from Kelvin to 231-378-5941 cell. The fourth arrow goes from George to 123-567-4389 work. The fifth arrow goes from George to 639-847-6971 cell. The sixth arrow goes from Christa to 567-534-2970 work. The seventh arrow goes from Mike to 567-534-2970 work. The eighth arrow goes from Mike to 798-367-8541 cell." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/ba119f3829ed1c6ac115b2828bcd349040f3e4e8"></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, this relation is not a function. Since both George and Mike are mapped to two different phone numbers, every input does not have exactly one output value.</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="8">
  <li>Is the following relation a function? Explain your answer.</li>
</ol>
<p>{\((7,&minus;3),(&minus;5,&minus;4),(8,&minus;0),(0,0),(&minus;6,4),(&minus;2,2),(&minus;1,3)\)}</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, this relation is a function. Every input has exactly one output value.</p>
