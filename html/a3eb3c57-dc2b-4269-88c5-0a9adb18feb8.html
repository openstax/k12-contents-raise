      <p>Complete the following questions to practice the skills you have learned in this lesson.<br>
        For 1-4, Use the problem below:</p>
      <p>A car has a 16-gallon fuel tank. When driven on a highway, it has a gas mileage of 30 miles per gallon. The gas mileage (also called "fuel efficiency") tells us the number of miles the car can travel for a particular amount of fuel (one gallon of gasoline, in this case). After filling the gas tank, the driver got on a highway and drove for a while.</p>
      <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li>How many miles has the car traveled if it has the following amounts of gas left in the tank? <strong>Enter only integers.<br>
          </strong>a.
