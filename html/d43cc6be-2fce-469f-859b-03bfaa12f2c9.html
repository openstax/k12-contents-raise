<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity introduces students to the average rate of change by building on what students know about rate of change and slope.</p>
<p>Students see that finding the change in the output for every unit of change in the input can be a useful way to generalize what happens between two function values, regardless of the behaviors of individual data points between them. They recognize that this number tells us how, on average, one quantity is changing relative to the other, and that it can be useful for comparing the trends in different intervals of a function.</p>
<p>In the activity, students find average rates of change by reasoning and using their knowledge of linear relationships. Monitor for the following strategies (the examples shown are for finding the average rate of change between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m.):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Find the hourly changes in temperature and calculate the average. The temperature fell by 2&deg;F the first hour, then 4&deg;F, 0&deg;F, and 3&deg;F in the next three hours. The average is \(\frac{2+4+0+3}4=\frac94\), or 2.25&deg;F per hour.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Find the overall change in temperature and divide by the overall change in hours. The temperature fell 9&deg;F in 4 hours, which means an average drop of 2.25&deg;F per hour.</li>
  <li>Find the slope of the line connecting the two end points of the interval. The slope between \((6,17)\) and \((10,8)\) is \(\frac{8-17}{10-6}=\frac{-9}4=-2.25\), which means an average drop of 2.25&deg;F per hour.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the activity synthesis, students generalize their reasoning and see that finding the average rate of change is indeed equivalent to finding the slope of the line connecting the two points.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Ask students to keep their materials closed. Display a scatter plot with the two temperature data points plotted, as shown.</p>
<p>Tell students that it shows the temperature at 4 p.m. and the temperature at 10 p.m.</p>
<p><img alt="Two points. hours since noon and temperature in degrees Fahrenheit." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/059a8addf80870b33a2430ddd9af8d78607384db"></p>
<p>Ask students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;How did the temperature change between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m.?&rdquo; (It fell.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How much did it fall?&rdquo; (17&deg;F)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Can we tell how fast, or at what rate, the temperature was falling? If so, how?&rdquo; (It fell 17&deg;F in 6 hours. If it was falling at a constant rate, it would be falling \(\frac{17}{6}\) or about 2.8&deg;F per hour. If we connect the points with a line and find its slope, it would be about &ndash;2.8.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;If not, why not?&rdquo; (There is not enough information about what happened between the two data points. It might not be falling at the same rate.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Display a scatter plot with the hourly data points plotted.</p>
<p>Give students a moment to notice and wonder something about the data and solicit a few responses. If no students mention the temperatures changing at different rates (a lot, a little, or not at all) each hour, ask them about it.</p>
<p><img alt="Discrete function. hours since noon and temperature in degrees Fahrenheit." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/30a136c871c453e55714fb6db87ad6175c151e90"></p>
<p>Discuss with students: &ldquo;Do the hourly data between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. help us better characterize how fast the temperature was falling between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m.? Could we still say that it was falling about 2.8&deg;F an hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Students are likely to comment that a line connecting \((4,25)\) and \((10,8)\) approximates the distribution of points in that interval and conclude that &ndash;2.8&deg;F per hour is a reasonable rate to use.</p>
<p>Explain to students that it can be helpful to have a way to quantify how a quantity is changing over a particular interval, without worrying about the smaller changes during the interval. The rate of &ndash;2.8&deg;F per hour serves that purpose. It is the average rate of change between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m.</p>
<h4>Student Facing Statement </h4>
<p>The table and graph show a more complete picture of the temperature changes on the same winter day. The function \(T\) gives the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, \(h\) hours since noon.</p>

<p>How much the quantity changes over a particular interval, without worrying about smaller changes in between, is the average rate of change.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Find the average rate of change for the following intervals. Be prepared to show your reasoning.

<h4>Student Response</h4>

  <li>
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
      <li>1&deg;F per hour. The temperature rose by 1&deg;F in 1 hour. </li>
      <li>1.75&deg;F per hour. The temperature increased by 7&deg;F in 4 hours. The average increase is \(\frac74\) or 1.75. </li>
      <li>&ndash;0.92&deg;F an hour. I found the slope of the line connecting the two points, and it is \(-\frac{11}{12}\). <br><br></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The temperature dropped faster between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. For example: In the first interval, the temperature fell 8&deg;F in 2 hours, which is an average drop of 4&deg;F an hour. In the second, it fell 9&deg;F in 4 hours, which is an average drop of 2.25&deg;F per hour.</li>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>It is possible that students will not understand that a graph is also read from left to right. This could be a problem when determining intervals of increase and decrease. Often students forget that the \(y\)-values are on top of the formula for average rate of change, and the \(x\)-values are on the bottom. One way to check themselves if they are mixing up the numerator and denominator is for them to check the reasonableness of the answer. Sometimes this helps them find their mistakes on their own.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students to share how they determined the average rates of change for the specified intervals. Arrange the presentations in the order listed in the Activity Narrative.</p>
<p>Then, point out that all strategies involve finding how much the temperature (the output) changed per unit of change in time (the input), and that this is done by division.</p>
<p>Display a graph with two points labeled \((a,f(a))\) and \((b,f(b))\). Ask students how we might find the average rate of change between the two points.</p>
<p>Make sure students can generalize their work and see that:</p>
<p>average rate of \(\mathrm{change} = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\)</p>

<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<div>
  <p>Prior to the whole-class discussion, invite students to create a visual display that shows how they determined the average rates of change for the specified intervals. Students should consider how to represent their strategy so that other students will be able to understand their solution method. Students may wish to add notes or details to their displays to help communicate their reasoning and thinking. Begin the whole-class discussion by selecting and arranging 2&ndash;4 displays for all to see. Give students 1&ndash;2 minutes of quiet time to think individually to interpret the displays before inviting the authors to share their strategies as described in the activity narrative. This will help students make connections between different ways to find the average rate of change.</p>

<p>What is the average rate of change of the first 10 minutes of the race?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To find the average rate of change of the first 10 minutes of the race, you would look at the first data value on the table and the third data value on the table, since it corresponds to 10 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember the average rate of change formula is \(\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\), where \((b, f(b))\) typically represents your second data point and \((a, f(a))\) represents your first data point.</p>
<p>For this situation, it would be \(( 0, 0)\) or \(a=0\) and \(f(a) =0\) and \((10,1.86)\) or \(b= 10\) and \(f(b)=1.86\).</p>
<p>Substituting the points into the average rate of change formula results in the following:</p>
<p>\(\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\), which is \(\frac{1.86}{10}\) or 0.186 mile per minute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice that the answer is positive, and the points on the graph are higher each time.</p>

<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to find the average rate of change of the first 25 minutes of the race:</p>
<p>Remember, the average rate of change formula is \(\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\), where \((b, f(b))\) typically represents your second data point and \((a, f(a))\) represents your first data point.</p>
<p>For this situation, it would be \((0, 0)\) or \(a=0\) and \(f(a) =0\) and \((25,5.67)\) or \(b= 25\) and \(f(b)=5.67\).</p>
<p>Substituting the points into the average rate of change formula results in the following:</p>
<p>\(\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}=\frac{5.67}{25}\), which is 0.227 mile per minute.</p>
