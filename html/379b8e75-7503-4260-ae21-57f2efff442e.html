<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>Your teacher will show a video of a flag being raised. Function \(H\) gives the height of the flag over time. Height is measured in feet. Time is measured in seconds since the flag is fully secured to the string, which is when the video clip begins.</p>
<br>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Use your own graph paper to sketch a graph that could represent the function \(H\). Be sure to include a label and a scale for each axis.
