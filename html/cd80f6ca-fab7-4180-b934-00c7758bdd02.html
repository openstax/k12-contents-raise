<h4>1.14.2: Self Check</h4>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold"><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">QUESTION:</p>
<p>Which of the following is the equation of a line that has a slope of 3 and goes through the point \((1, -2)\)?</p>

    <tr>
      <td>\(y= 3x -2 \)</td>
      <td>Incorrect. Let’s try again a different way: Substitute the slope in for m and the point \((1, -2)\) for \((x, y)\) in \(y=mx +b\). This becomes \(-2=3(1) +b\). The answer is:\( y = 3x - 5\). </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\( y = 3x +1\)</td>
      <td> Incorrect. Let’s try again a different way: When solving for b, make sure to use inverse operations. The answer is: \(y = 3x - 5\).</td>

    <tr>
      <td>\(y = 3x - 5\)</td>
      <td> That’s correct! Check yourself: Substitute the slope in for m and the point \((1, -2)\) for \((x, y)\) in \(y=mx +b\). This becomes \(-2=3(1) +b\). Then solve for \(b\) which is \(-5\). </td>

    <tr>
      <td>\(y= 1x -2\)</td>
      <td> Incorrect. Let’s try again a different way: Substitute the slope in for m and the point \((1, -2)\) for \((x, y)\) in \(y=mx +b\). This becomes \(-2=3(1) +b\). The answer is: \(y = 3x - 5\). </td>
