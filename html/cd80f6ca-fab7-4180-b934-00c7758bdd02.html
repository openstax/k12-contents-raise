<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>Previously in this unit, students have practiced solving for a particular variable and also connected equations to graphs. In earlier lessons, they worked to write the equation of a line from tables, graphs, and given information. Students have already written equations in slope-intercept form given a point and slope and in point-slope form given two points. Now, they will work to write linear equations in slope-intercept form given two points using point-slope form and not using point-slope form in the process.</p>
<p>They will need to activate prior knowledge of using the slope formula as well as the forms used and the meaning of the variables in each form.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Divide students into pairs. Have students work independently on questions 1-3 then compare and discuss answers and work. Then have them repeat for 4-7. For questions 8-12, have students work in their pairs.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Questions 1-3 reinforce the work that was done in the warm up.</p>
<p>For question 10, ask if any students used the other point for substitution. Show students the comparison of the work when each point is used. Emphasize that since both points are on the line, either point works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ask: &ldquo;What was the advantage of using \((5, 2)\) for this problem?&rdquo; (The fraction in the slope canceled making it easier to solve for \(b\).)</p>
<p>If time allows, have students connect back to graphing by graphing the lines in the activity. Compare how negative versus positive slopes change the graphs. Have students identify the \(y\)-intercept of each line.</p>
