<p>In this lesson, you will determine what expressions would produce graphs with particular vertices. We will look more closely at how changing the \(h\) and the \(k\) in a quadratic expression of the form \(a(x&minus;h)^2+k\) translates the graph, and recall that the coefficient \(a\) affects the direction of the opening of a parabola.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Describe how changing a number in the vertex form of a quadratic function affects its graph. </li>
</ul>
