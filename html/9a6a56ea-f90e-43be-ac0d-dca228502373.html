<h3>Activity (10 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity reinforces what students learned earlier about the connections between the solutions of a quadratic equation and the zeros of a quadratic function. Previously, students were given equations and asked to graph them to determine the number of solutions and their values. Here, they are prompted to work the other way around: to write an equation to represent a quadratic function with only one solution. To do so, students need to make use of the structure of the factored form and their knowledge of the zero product property.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Give students access to graphing technology. It can be Desmos or other technology outside the course.</p>
<h4>Student Activity </h4>
<p>In previous lessons, we saw that a quadratic equation can have zero, one, or two solutions.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" class="os-raise-noindent">

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Graph the function defined by \(f(x) = x^2&minus; 2x + 1\). Examine the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph.</li>
</ol>
<p>Use the Desmos graphing tool or technology outside the course.</p>
<p>Explain what the \(x\)-intercepts reveal about the function.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The graph only intersects the \(x\)-axis at one point: \((1, 0)\). The function only has one zero.</p>

  <li>Solve \(x^2&minus; 2x + 1 = 0\) by using the factored form and zero product property. What solutions do you get?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Rewrite the standard form to \((x &minus; 1)(x &minus; 1) = 0\). The solutions are \(x=1\) and \(x=1\). Because the two values are the same, we say that this equation has one solution and that \(x = 1\) is a double root for the equation.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> For example: \(f(x) = (x + 4)(x + 4)\). When graphed, this function only has one zero, at \(x=-4\).</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share how they solved the equation algebraically. Next, invite students to share the equations they generated. Record and display them for all to see.</p>
<p>Students most likely have written equations in the form of \(g(x) = (x + m)(x + m)\). Ask students why the factored form, rather than the standard form, might have been preferred. Highlight that by using the same expression for the two factors, we know that the solution to \((x + m)(x + m) = 0\) will be a single number.</p>
<p>Ask students to describe the graph of a quadratic function with one solution. Point out that this means that the function will have only one zero, and the graph of the function will have a single horizontal intercept.</p>

<h4>Writing an Equation to Represent a Quadratic Function with Only One Solution</h4>
<p><strong>Identifying the Number of Zeros</strong></p>
<p>How many zeros does the graph of the function \(f(x) = x^2+ 5x &minus; 14\) have? How can you find out without graphing the function?</p>
<p>Let's find the factored form of the function and solve it.</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Set the function equal to 0.<br>
  \(x^2+ 5x &minus; 14 = 0\) </p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Find the factored form.<br>
  \((x + 7)(x &minus; 2) = 0\) </p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Set each factor equal to 0 and solve.<br>
  \(x = -7\) and \(x = 2\)</p>
<p>Since there are two solutions, we know that the function \(f(x) = x^2+ 5x &minus; 14\) will have zeros at \(x=-7\) and \(x=2\).</p>
<p>In other words, the \(x\)-intercepts of the function are \((-7, 0)\) and \((2, 0)\).</p>
<p>For any function, the number of solutions is equal to the number of zeros when graphed.</p>
<p><strong>Writing an Equation to Represent a Quadratic Function with One Solution</strong></p>
<p>We can also find a quadratic function if we know the zeros. For example, if we want to write a quadratic function that has one zero or one solution, we can start with a factored form of the function representing one zero or solution.</p>
<p>Any factored form of a function with a factor that repeats itself, such as \((x &minus; 3)(x &minus; 3)\), has only one solution or one zero.</p>
<p>We can graph the function \(f(x) = (x &minus; 3)(x &minus; 3)\) to check our prediction.</p>
<p>We know the solution is \(x=3\). Let's rewrite the function in standard form.</p>
<p>Factored form:<br>
  \(f(x) = (x &minus; 3)(x &minus; 3)\) </p>
<p>Multiply to find standard form:<br>
  \(f(x) = x^2&minus; 6x + 9\) </p>
<p>Now, we graph the function \(f(x) = x^2&minus; 6x + 9\).</p>
<p><img alt="GRAPH OF A PARABOLA THAT OPENS UP WITH A VERTEX AT THE POINT (3, 0)." height="410" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c8b227aec550d08016f6927c0d4cc47ce1c1e89c" width="400"></p>
<p>The graph of the function has one zero at \(x=3\). The \(x\)-intercept of the function is \((3, 0)\). The equation is said to have a double root at this point.</p>
<p>So, our prediction was correct.</p>

<p>Write down your answers, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to write the quadratic functions in standard form:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>The quadratic function has two solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>This means the factors in factored form are not equal. We could use:<br>
  \(f(x) = (x + 5)(x + 2)\).</p>
<p>Multiply to find standard form.<br>
  \(f(x) = x^2+ 7x + 10\) </p>
<p>The graph of \(f(x) = x^2+ 7x + 10\) has two zeros. The \(x\)-intercepts will be \((-5, 0)\) and \((-2, 0)\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>The quadratic function has one solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>That means the factors in factored form are equal. We could use:<br>
  \(f(x) = (x + 10)(x + 10)\).</p>
<p>Multiply to find standard form.<br>
  \(f(x) = x^2+ 20x + 100\) </p>
<p>The graph of \(f(x) = x^2+ 20x + 100\) has one zero. The \(x\)-intercept will be \((-10, 0)\).</p>
