<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity reinforces what students learned earlier about the connections between the solutions of a quadratic
  equation and the zeros of a quadratic function. Previously, students were given equations and asked to graph them to
  determine the number of solutions and their values. Here, they are prompted to work the other way around: to write an
  equation to represent a quadratic function with only one solution. To do so, students need to make use of the
  structure of the factored form and their knowledge of the zero product property.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Give students access to graphing technology. It can be Desmos or other technology outside the course.</p>

    <p>Use this routine to prepare students for the whole-class discussion. At the appropriate time, invite student pairs to create a visual display of their equation and graph of a quadratic function with only one zero. Allow students time to quietly circulate and analyze at least two other visual displays in the room. Give students quiet think time to consider how the zero is represented in the equation and graph of the quadratic function. Next, ask students to return to their partner and discuss what they noticed. Listen for and amplify observations that connect the zero of the function with the -intercept of the graph. This will help students make connections between the algebraic and graphical representation of quadratic functions.</p>

<h4>Student Activity </h4>
<p>In previous lessons, we saw that a quadratic equation can have zero, one, or two solutions.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Sketch graphs that represent three quadratic functions: one that has no zeros, one with one zero, and one with two
    zeros.</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answers, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answers:</strong><br>
  No zeros:</p>

  <li>Graph the function defined by \(f(x) = x^2&minus; 2x + 1\). Examine the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph.</li>
</ol>
<p>Use the Desmos graphing tool or technology outside the course.</p>
<p>Explain what the \(x\)-intercepts reveal about the function.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The graph only intersects the \(x\)-axis at one point: \((1, 0)\). The function only has one

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Rewrite the standard form to \((x &minus; 1)(x &minus; 1) = 0\). The solutions are \(x=1\)
  and \(x=1\). Because the two values are the same, we say that this equation has one solution and that \(x = 1\) is a
  double root for the equation.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share how they solved the equation algebraically. Next, invite students to share the equations
  they generated. Record and display them for all to see.</p>
<p>Students most likely have written equations in the form of \(g(x) = (x + m)(x + m)\). Ask students why the factored
  form, rather than the standard form, might have been preferred. Highlight that by using the same expression for the
  two factors, we know that the solution to \((x + m)(x + m) = 0\) will be a single number.</p>
<p>Ask students to describe the graph of a quadratic function with one solution. Point out that this means that the
  function will have only one zero, and the graph of the function will have a single horizontal intercept.</p>

        That's correct! Check yourself: The factored form of \(x^2&minus;14x + 49\) is \((x &minus; 7)(x &minus;
        7)\). Since there is only one solution, \(x = 7\), the graph of the function only has one zero.

<h4>Writing an Equation to Represent a Quadratic Function with Only One Solution</h4>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Identifying the Number of Zeros</p>
<p>How many zeros does the graph of the function \(f(x) = x^2+ 5x &minus; 14\) have? How can you find out without
  graphing the function?</p>
<p>Let's find the factored form of the function and solve it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Set the function equal to 0.</p>
<p>  \(x^2+ 5x &minus; 14 = 0\) </p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Find the factored form.</p>
<p>  \((x + 7)(x &minus; 2) = 0\) </p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Set each factor equal to 0 and solve.</p>
<p>  \(x = -7\) and \(x = 2\)</p>
<p>Since there are two solutions, we know that the function \(f(x) = x^2+ 5x &minus; 14\) will have zeros at \(x=-7\)
  and \(x=2\).</p>
<p>In other words, the \(x\)-intercepts of the function are \((-7, 0)\) and \((2, 0)\).</p>
<p>For any function, the number of solutions is equal to the number of zeros when graphed.</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Writing an Equation to Represent a Quadratic Function with One Solution</p>
<p>We can also find a quadratic function if we know the zeros. For example, if we want to write a quadratic function
  that has one zero or one solution, we can start with a factored form of the function representing one zero or
  solution.</p>
<p>Any factored form of a function with a factor that repeats itself, such as \((x &minus; 3)(x &minus; 3)\), has only
  one solution or one zero.</p>
<p>We can graph the function \(f(x) = (x &minus; 3)(x &minus; 3)\) to check our prediction.</p>
<p>We know the solution is \(x=3\). Let's rewrite the function in standard form.</p>
<p>Factored form:<br>
  \(f(x) = (x &minus; 3)(x &minus; 3)\) </p>
<p>Multiply to find standard form:<br>
  \(f(x) = x^2&minus; 6x + 9\) </p>
<p>Now, we graph the function \(f(x) = x^2&minus; 6x + 9\).</p>
<p><img alt="GRAPH OF A PARABOLA THAT OPENS UP WITH A VERTEX AT THE POINT (3, 0)." height="410" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c8b227aec550d08016f6927c0d4cc47ce1c1e89c" width="400"></p>
<p>The graph of the function has one zero at \(x=3\). The \(x\)-intercept of the function is \((3, 0)\). The equation is
  said to have a double root at this point.</p>
<p>So, our prediction was correct.</p>
