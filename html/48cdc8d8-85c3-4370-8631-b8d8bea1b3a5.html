<p>In this lesson, you will write a system of equations to represent the quantities and constraints in each of several situations, find a solution that meets multiple constraints by graphing, and then interpret the solution in context.</p>


<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explain &ldquo;the solution to a system of linear equations&rdquo; and how the solution is represented graphically.</li>
  <li>Refer to two equations as a system of equations.</li>
  <li>Use tables and graphs to solve systems of equations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities </strong>that will help you reach those goals:</p>
