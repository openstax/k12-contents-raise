<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>The purpose of this task is for students to generate a list of numbers based on a rule. Since this activity is also meant to help set the expectation that students are responsible for creating mathematical objects, like lists of numbers, and making sense of activities, there is no need to identify any specific vocabulary, such as &ldquo;sequence,&rdquo; &ldquo;term,&rdquo; or &ldquo;arithmetic,&rdquo; at this time. In the next activity, students will generate a list of numbers from a puzzle and then describe the pattern in the list.</p>
<p>As students are working, monitor for students who have generated a successful sequence and invite them to share during the discussion.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Tell students there are many possible answers. After brief quiet work time, ask students to compare their responses to their partner&rsquo;s and decide whether they are both correct, even if they are different. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>
<p>Avoid demonstrating a possible sequence of 5 numbers for the whole class first to set up the expectation that students are responsible for making sense of the activities.</p>
<h4>Student Facing Statement</h4>
<p>Here is a rule for making a list of numbers: <em>Each number is 1 less than twice the previous number.</em></p>
<p>Pick a number to start with. Then follow the rule to build a list of 5 numbers.</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li> 2, 3, 5, 9, 17 </li>
  <li> 5, 9, 17, 33, 65 </li>
  <li> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 </li>
</ul>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>If a student has trouble getting started, ask them to first pick a number. Once they&rsquo;ve picked a number, ask what the next number would be, according to the rule. Then invite them to continue.</p>
<p>Some students may interpret &ldquo;1 less than twice a number&rdquo; as \(1-2x\) (where \(x\) is the number). Ask these students questions like:</p>
<ul>
  <li> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s 1 less than 5?&rdquo; (4) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s 1 less than 5 times 2?&rdquo; (9) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s 1 less than 100?&rdquo; (99) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s 1 less than 100 times 2?&rdquo; (199) </li>
</ul>
<p>Write some of these statements on the board along with their translation into mathematical expressions. For example, write &ldquo;1 less than 5 times 2&rdquo; next to \(5\cdot2-1\).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite previously identified students to present their lists. Ask the other students to verify their calculations.</p>
