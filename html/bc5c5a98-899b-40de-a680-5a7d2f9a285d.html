<h3>Activity (10 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity introduces students to the vertex form. Students examine the parameters in expressions of this form and the graphs of functions defined by such expressions. They look for structure in the given representations and notice that there are connections between the numbers in each expression and the vertex of the corresponding graph.</p>
<p>Students also see that we can rewrite the expression in vertex form into another form and show that the expressions are equivalent. Writing equivalent expressions allows students to practice applying the distributive property to expand expressions containing two sums or two differences.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Give students a minute to read the task statement. Before students answer the questions, briefly discuss the worked example to make sure students can follow the reasoning that illustrates the equivalence of the expressions defining \(h\) and \(f\).</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here are two sets of equations for quadratic functions you saw earlier. In each set, the expressions that define the output are equivalent. In other words, all the equations in Set 1 define the same function. The same is true for Set 2: all the equations define the same function but they are just written in different forms.</p>
<p><strong>Set 1:</strong></p>
<p>\(f(x)=x^2+4x\)</p>
<p>\(g(x)=x(x+4)\)</p>
<p>\(h(x)=(x+2)^2&minus;4\)</p>
<p><strong>Set 2:</strong></p>
<p>\(p(x)=-x^2+6x&minus;5\)</p>
<p>\(q(x)=(5&minus;x)(x&minus;1)\)</p>
<p>\(r(x)=-1(x&minus;3)^2+4\)</p>
<p>The expression that defines \(h\) is written in vertex form. We can show that it is equivalent to the expression defining \(f\) by expanding and simplifying the expression:</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}(x+2)2-4&amp;=&amp;(x+2)(x+2)-4\\&amp;=&amp;x2+2x+2x+4-4\\&amp;=&amp;x2+4x,\;\mathrm{which}\;\mathrm{is}\;f(x)\end{array}\) </p>
<p>If this simplified expression is factored, then we arrive at the expression that defines function \(g\): \(x^2+4x=x(x+4)\). The expression that defines \(g\) is written in factored form. The simplified expression that defines function \(f\) is written in standard form.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Expanding and simplifying function \(r\), \(-1(x&minus;3)^2+4 gives -1(x^2&minus;6x+9)+4\), which equals \(-x^2+6x&minus;9+4\) or \(-x^2+6x&minus;5\).</p>
<p>For questions 2&ndash;3, examine the graphs representing the quadratic functions.</p>

</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>Why do you think expressions such as those defining \(h\) and \(r\) are said to be written in vertex form?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer: </strong>The numbers in vertex form seem to give the coordinates of the vertex of the graph. When a positive number is added to the \(x\) in the parentheses, the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex seems to be negative&mdash;which is the opposite of that number. When a number is subtracted from \(x\), the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex seems to be positive&mdash;which is the opposite of what it looks like.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may incorrectly think that \((x&minus;3)^2\) is \((x^2&minus;32)\). Remind them that \((x&minus;3)^2\) means \((x&minus;3)(x&minus;3)\). Consider pointing out the example in the task statement to help students show that the expressions for \(r\) and \(p\) are equivalent.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to show that the expressions defining functions \(r\) and \(p\) are equivalent. Consider pointing out that at the moment it is easier to show equivalence by going from vertex form to standard form than from standard form to vertex form. In a future unit, we will look at how to do the latter.</p>
<p>Then, discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> "What information does a quadratic expression in the vertex form reveal? How does it show that information?" (It reveals the coordinates of the vertex of the parabola. The number in the parentheses seems to be related to the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex. The number outside seems to be the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex.) </li>
  <li> "What doesn't it tell us?" (It does not allow us to easily see the \(x\)- or \(y\)-intercepts.) </li>
  <li> "Why do you think this form is used?" (Sometimes we want to know the maximum or the minimum of a function. It is helpful to be able to see it in the expression or equation defining the function.) </li>
  <li> "Can you give an example of a situation when it might be useful to have the relationship modeled using an expression in vertex form?" (Examples: when we are interested in the maximum height of an object in projectile motion, or when we want to know the maximum revenue in a business model.) </li>
</ul>

<h4>Equivalent Forms of Quadratics</h4>
<p>Quadratics can be written in different equivalent forms:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> Standard form: \(y=ax^2+bx+c\) </li>
  <li> Factored form: \(y = (x + a)(x + b)\) </li>
  <li> Vertex form: \(y=a(x-h)^2+k\) </li>
</ul>
<p>Example</p>
<p>Write \(y=(x+2)^2-9\) in standard and factored forms.</p>
<p>Here is how to find the equivalent standard form:</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Expand the vertex form to multiply the binomials.<br>
  \(y=(x+2)(x+2)-9\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Multiply the binomials.<br>
  \(y=x^2+2x+2x+4-9\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Combine like terms.<br>
  \(y=x^2+4x-5\)</p>
<p>Here is how to find the factored form:</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  From the standard form, find the factors of the trinomial expression \(y=x^2+4x-5\).</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Examine the trinomial expression.<br>
  \(x^2+4x-5\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Factor the trinomial.<br>
  \((x + 5)(x - 1)\)</p>
<p>The factored form is \(y = (x + 5)(x - 1)\).</p>
