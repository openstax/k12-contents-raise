<h4>Using Various Methods to Solve Quadratic Equations</h4>
<p>A tennis ball is thrown out of the window of a building. The equation modeling the height of the tennis ball, in feet, \(t\) seconds after being thrown is shown here.</p>
<p>\(f(t) = -24t^2 + 33t + 30\)</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s find the equation we would solve to find the time at which the ball hits the ground.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the ball hits the ground, its height will be 0. So, we set the equation to 0.</p>
<p>\(-24t^2 + 33t + 30 = 0\)</p>
<p>The equation above represents the ball when it hits the ground. The solution to this equation represents the time it takes from when the ball is thrown for it to hit the ground.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to solve the equation.</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
    Write the equation to be solved.<br>
    \(-24t^2 + 33t + 30 = 0\) </p>
<p>Step 2<br>
    Subtract 30 from each side of the equation.<br>
    \(-24t^2 + 33t = -30\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
    Divide each side of the equation by 3.<br>
    \(-8t^2 + 11t = -10\) </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to solve the remaining equation using guess and check.</p>
<p>When \(t = 3\), the expression \(-8t^2 + 11t\) has a value of \(-8(3)^2 + 11(3)\), or \(-39\). This value is not equal to the \(-10\) we needed to find.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When \(t = 2\), the expression \(-8t^2 + 11t\) has a value of \(-8(2)^2 + 11(2)\), or \(-10\). This value is equal to the \(-10\) we needed to find.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The equation is true when \(t = 2\), so the ball took 2 seconds to hit the ground. This method works but can be more difficult when the solution is a decimal. Graphing can also work, but it is time consuming and results in an approximate solution.</p>

<p>An arc of water flows from a water fountain down to a pool below it. The height of the arc above the pool, in inches, can be modeled using the equation \(f(x) = -2x^2 + 5x + 3\), where \(x\) is the horizontal distance the water has traveled, in inches, from the water fountain.</p>

<p><span>Here is how to write and solve the equation representing the arc of water from the water fountain:</span><br></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>The equation \(-2x^2 + 5x + 3 = 0\) represents the arc of the water when it reaches the pool below.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li>To solve the equation \(-2x^2 + 5x + 3 = 0\), let&rsquo;s try using guess and check with substitution.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>First, we try \(x = 2\).</p>
<p>\(-2(2)^2+5(2)+3\overset?=0\) <br>
        \(5 \neq 0\) </p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s try \(x = 3\).</p>
<p>\(-2(3)^2+5(3)+3\overset?=0\)<br>
        \(0 = 0\)</p>
<p>Since the equation is true, \(x = 3\) is correct.</p>
<p>The arc of water has traveled 3 inches horizontally when it reaches the pool below the fountain.</p>
