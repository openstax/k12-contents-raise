<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>We can  determine the slope and intercept of a line if the equation is written in slope-intercept form, \( y = mx + b \), where \(m\) is the slope and \( b \) is the \( y \)-intercept. Now we will do the reverse&mdash;we will start with the slope and \(y\)-intercept and use them to write the equation of the line.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Students found the slope of a line using the formula. Use a graph to demonstrate that the slope of the line is the ratio of rise over run, change in \( y \) over change in \( x \). Ask students: </p>
<ul>
  <li>How can you identify the \( y \)-intercept from a graph? (It is the point where the line crosses the \( y \)-axis.) </li>
  <li>What is the value of \( x \) where the line crosses the \( y \)-axis? (0)  </li>
</ul>

<p>This activity uses multiple approaches to review the identification of the slope and y-intercept from an equation given in slope-intercept form.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Use the Desmos Teacher Dashboard to monitor student responses for screens 1 - 3.
  </li>
  <li>
    Screen 4, or question 4, asks students to match the correct slope and y-intercept with an equation using a digital card sort.
  </li>
  <li>
    Screen 5, or question 5, asks students to write an equation given the slope and y-intercept. For this question, students are given the choice to share their response with the class. This allows students to compare their own response with the one submitted by others. Follow up with a whole-class discussion.
  </li>
  <li>
    Screen 6 repeats the process of asking students to write an equation given the slope and y-intercept - but it also asks students to explain their reasoning. Follow up with a whole-class discussion.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Use the whole-class discussions to help students develop a connection between the equation of a line and the features of its graph. If you would like, arrange the students into partners and allow them to work together on this activity.</p>
<br>
<p>Desmos activities are different from the graphing calculator application because they lead students through one or more interactive tasks. As students progress through the activity, teachers may use the Teacher Dashboard to monitor student responses and use them for whole group discussion. Activities may also be set to identify student responses that are correct or incorrect.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - If you have not already created a free account, access <a href="https://teacher.desmos.com/">teacher.desmos.com</a> and create your account. Search for the activity using the title above or <a href="https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/64a712cbf03563b68f6514e2">this link</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Once you have selected the activity, hit the <strong>Assign </strong>button and set up a<strong> Single Session Code</strong>. If you have experience with Desmos activities and have already set up your classes within the program, you may prefer to assign the activity to your classes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Once you have created your code, scroll down to <strong>Activity Sessions </strong>and select <strong>View Dashboard</strong>.

    <h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
    <p>The slope-intercept form of the equation of a line is the most commonly used form. You can identify the slope and the \( y \)-intercept, and it is the form used to graph the line using a graphing calculator. The equation \( y=mx+b \) may look to some students like there are 4 variables. Point out the \( m \) and \( b \) are numbers that you are given to substitute into the equation. The value of \( m \) is the coefficient of \( x \), and the value of \( b \) is the constant in the equation of the line.</p>
    <p>Students may be confused about the value of \( b \) as the \( y \)-intercept. Elicit that the \( y \)-intercept is the point where the graph crosses the \( y \)-axis. The \( x \)-value of the \( y \)-intercept is zero. In the slope-intercept form, the \( b \) represents the \(y\)-value of the \( y \)-intercept. Sometimes the \( y \)-intercept is identified as just the \( y \)-value. For example, the \( y \)-intercept is 2 really means the \( y \)-intercept is \( (0, 2) \). To write the equation of a line in slope-intercept form, substitute 2 for \( b \): \( y=mx+2 \). </p>
    <p>It may help students to practice writing equations with the same slope and different \(y\)-intercepts. For example, have students write the equation of a line with slope 2 and \( y \)-intercept \( (0, 4) \) \( (y=2x+4) \); slope 2 and \( y \)-intercept \( (0, -1) \) \( (y=2x-1) \); slope 2 and \( y \)-intercept \((0, 3)\) \( (y=2x+3) \). Then have students write the equation of a line with different slopes and the same \( y \)-intercept. For example, have students write the equation of a line with slope 4 and \( y \)-intercept 5; slope \( \frac{2}{3} \) and \( y \)-intercept 5; slope \( -\frac{1}{2} \) and \( y \)-intercept 5. </p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Name the slope. <br>
\( m = -1 \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Name the \( y \)-intercept. <br>
\( b = -3 \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Substitute the values into \( y = mx + b \).<br>
\( y = -1x + -3 \) <br>
\( y = -x-3 \) </p>

\( y \)-intercept \( (0, -4) \)<br>

<h4>Answer:</h4>
<p>Here is how to write the equation of the line in slope-intercept form:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 </strong>- Find the slope by counting the rise and run.<br>
  \( m=\frac{rise}{run} \) <br>
From \( (0, 1) \) to \( (5, 4) \), the slope is \( m = \frac{3}{5} \). </p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Find the \( y \)-intercept. <br>
\( y \)-intercept \( (0, 1) \)<br>
\( b = 1 \) </p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Substitute the values into \( y = mx + b\).<br>
\( y = mx +b \)<br>
\( y = \frac{3}{5} x + 1 \)</p>
