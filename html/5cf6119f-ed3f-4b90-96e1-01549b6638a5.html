<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>We can&nbsp; determine the slope and intercept of a line if the equation is written in slope-intercept form, \( y = mx + b \), where \(m\) is the slope and&nbsp;\( b \) is the \( y \)-intercept. Now we will do the reverse&mdash;we will start with the slope and \(y\)-intercept and use them to write the equation of the line.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Students found the slope of a line using the formula. Use a graph to demonstrate that the slope of the line is the ratio of rise over run, change in&nbsp;\( y \) over change in \( x \). Ask students:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>How can you identify the \( y \)-intercept from a graph? (It is the point where the line crosses the \(&nbsp;y&nbsp;\)-axis.)&nbsp;</li>
<li>What is the value of \(&nbsp;x&nbsp;\) where the line crosses the \(&nbsp;y&nbsp;\)-axis? (0)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Allow students to use a graphing calculator or Desmos to check their answers where appropriate. Students develop a connection between the equation of a line and the features of its graph.</p>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<p>Recall that the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line is \( y = mx+b \), where \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the \( y \)-intercept. The \( y \)-intercept is the point where the graph crosses the \( y \)-axis. For \( y \)-intercept \( b \), the coordinates of the point are \( (0, b) \).<br></p>
<p>1. For each of the three equations below, tell the slope, \(&nbsp;m&nbsp;\), and \( y \)-intercept, \(&nbsp;b&nbsp;\).</p>

<p>2. Here are some slopes and \( y \)-intercepts. Tell which equation matches each set of slopes and \( y \)-intercepts.</p>
<p>a. slope: \( -2 \), \( y \)-intercept: \( 3 \)<br>b. slope: \( 3 \), \( y \)-intercept: \( -2 \)<br>c. slope: \( 2 \), \( y \)-intercept: \( -3 \)<br>d. slope: \( \frac{1}{2}\), \( y \)-intercept: \( -3 \)</p>

<p>3. Write the equation of a line with the following slope and \( y \)-intercept in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p>a. slope \(&nbsp;&minus;9&nbsp;\) and \( y \)-intercept \(&nbsp;(0, &minus;4)&nbsp;\)<br>b. slope \(&nbsp;\frac{2}{5}&nbsp;\) and \( y \)-intercept \(&nbsp;(0, 4)&nbsp;\)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>The slope-intercept form of the equation of a line is the most commonly used form. You can identify the slope and the \(&nbsp;y&nbsp;\)-intercept, and it is the form used to graph the line using a graphing calculator. The equation&nbsp;\( y=mx+b \) may look to some students like there are 4 variables. Point out the \(&nbsp;m&nbsp;\) and \(&nbsp;b&nbsp;\) are numbers that you are given to substitute into the equation. The value of \(&nbsp;m&nbsp;\) is the coefficient of \(&nbsp;x&nbsp;\), and the value of \(&nbsp;b&nbsp;\) is the constant in the equation of the line.</p>
<p>Students may be confused about the value of \(&nbsp;b&nbsp;\) as the \(&nbsp;y&nbsp;\)-intercept. Elicit that the \(&nbsp;y&nbsp;\)-intercept is the point where the graph crosses the \(&nbsp;y&nbsp;\)-axis. The \( x&nbsp;\)-value of the \(&nbsp;y&nbsp;\)-intercept is zero. In the slope-intercept form, the \(&nbsp;b&nbsp;\) represents the \(y\)-value of the \(&nbsp;y&nbsp;\)-intercept. Sometimes the \(&nbsp;y&nbsp;\)-intercept is identified as just the \(&nbsp;y&nbsp;\)-value. For example, the \(&nbsp;y&nbsp;\)-intercept is 2 really means the \(&nbsp;y&nbsp;\)-intercept is \(&nbsp;(0, 2)&nbsp;\). To write the equation of a line in slope-intercept form, substitute 2 for \(&nbsp;b&nbsp;\): \(&nbsp;y=mx+2&nbsp;\).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may help students to practice writing equations with the same slope and different \(y\)-intercepts. For example, have students write the equation of a line with slope 2 and \(&nbsp;y&nbsp;\)-intercept \(&nbsp;(0, 4)&nbsp;\) \(&nbsp;(y=2x+4)&nbsp;\); slope 2 and \(&nbsp;y&nbsp;\)-intercept \(&nbsp;(0, -1)&nbsp;\) \(&nbsp;(y=2x-1)&nbsp;\); slope 2 and \(&nbsp;y&nbsp;\)-intercept \((0, 3)\) \( (y=2x+3)&nbsp;\). Then have students write the equation of a line with different slopes and the same \(&nbsp;y&nbsp;\)-intercept. For example, have students write the equation of a line with slope 4 and \(&nbsp;y&nbsp;\)-intercept 5; slope \( \frac{2}{3} \) and \(&nbsp;y&nbsp;\)-intercept 5; slope \( -\frac{1}{2} \) and \(&nbsp;y&nbsp;\)-intercept 5.&nbsp;</p>
