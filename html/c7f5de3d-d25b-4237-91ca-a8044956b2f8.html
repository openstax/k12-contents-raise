<h4>Lesson Narrative&nbsp;</h4>
<p>This lesson begins with reviewing how to identify the vertex of a quadratic from the vertex form. The lesson also provides students with the opportunity to practice writing quadratic functions in vertex form, standard form, and factored form. When working to rewrite the equations through the different forms, students will strengthen their skills in the distributive property, completing the square, and using inverse operations.</p>
<p>In the cool down of the lesson, students will connect transformations of the quadratic parent function with the vertex and standard forms.</p>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p>

<ul>
  <li>(2A) distinguish sounds and intonation patterns of English with increasing ease</li>
  <li>(2B) recognize elements of the English sound system in newly acquired vocabulary such as long and short vowels, silent letters, and consonant clusters</li>
  <li>(3A) practice producing sounds of newly acquired vocabulary such as long and short vowels, silent letters, and consonant clusters to pronounce English words in a manner that is increasingly comprehensible</li>
  <li>(4A) learn relationships between sounds and letters of the English language and decode (sound out) words using a combination of skills such as recognizing sound-letter relationships and identifying cognates, affixes, roots, and base words</li>
  <li>(5A) learn relationships between sounds and letters of the English language to represent sounds when writing in English</li>
</ul>
