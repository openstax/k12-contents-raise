<h4>Graphing Linear Inequalities in Two Variables to Solve Applications</h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Many fields use linear inequalities to model a problem. While our examples may be about simple situations, they give us an opportunity to build our skills and to get a feel for how they might be used.</span><br></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><strong>EXAMPLE&nbsp;</strong></span><br></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Hilaria works two part time jobs in order to earn enough money to meet her obligations of at least $240 a week. Her job in food service pays $10 an hour and her tutoring job on campus pays $15 an hour. How many hours does Hilaria need to work at each job to earn at least $240?&nbsp;</span><br></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
  <li><span>Let&nbsp; x&nbsp; be the number of hours she works at the job in food service and let y be the number of hours she works tutoring. Write an inequality that would model this situation.</span></li>
  <li><span>Graph the inequality.&nbsp;</span></li>
  <li><span>Find three ordered pairs&nbsp; (x,y)&nbsp; that would be solutions to the inequality. Then, explain what that means for Hilaria.</span></li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span><strong>SOLUTION</strong></span><br></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We let x be the number of hours she works at the job in food service and let y be the number of hours she works tutoring. She earns $10 per hour at the job in food service and $15 an hour tutoring. At each job, the number of hours multiplied by the hourly wage will gives the amount earned at that job.</span><br></p>

<p>b. To graph the inequity, we put it in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p>\( \begin{eqnarray} 10x + 15y \geq 240 \\ 15y \geq -10x + 240 \\y \geq - \frac{2}{3}x + 16 \end{eqnarray} \)<br></p>

<p>c.&nbsp;From the graph, we see that the ordered pairs \( (15,10) \), \( (0,16) \),&nbsp;\( (24,0) \) represent three of infinitely many solutions. Check the values in the inequality.</p>

<p>For Hilaria, it means that to earn at least $240, she can work 15 hours tutoring and 10 hours at her fast-food job, earn all her money tutoring for 16 hours, or earn all her money while working 24 hours at the job in food service.</p>
