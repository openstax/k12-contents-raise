<p>Your teacher will give you a picture that is 7 inches by 4 inches, a piece of colored paper that measures 4 inches by 2.5 inches representing framing material, a ruler, and a pair of scissors.</p>
<p>Cut the framing material to create a rectangular frame for the picture. The frame should have the same width all the way around and have no overlaps. All of the framing material should be used with no leftover pieces. The frame should not cover any part of the picture.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s review the information we know.</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> The picture measures 7 inches by 4 inches. </li>
<li> There are 10 square inches of framing material. </li>
<li> The frame must be uniform in width. </li>
<li> All of the framing material must be used. </li>
<li> The frame should not cover any part of the picture. </li>
</ul>
<p>Describe the process you used to create the frame.</p>

<h4>Extending Your Thinking</h4>
<p>Juan says, &ldquo;The perimeter of the picture is 22 inches. If I cut the framing material into 9 pieces, each one being 2.5 inches by \(\frac {4}{9}\) inch, I&rsquo;ll have more than enough material to surround the picture because those pieces would yield \(9 \cdot 2.5\), or 22.5 inches for the frame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do you agree with Juan? Explain your reasoning.</p>

<p>Compare your answer:</p>
<p>No, Juan is not correct because 9 pieces would not be enough to go around the frame. While the total length of those pieces is enough to surround the picture, he will need at least two pieces for each short side to cover 4 inches and at least 3 pieces for each long side to cover 7 inches. This adds up to 10 pieces, as shown below.</p>
