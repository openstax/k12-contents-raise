<p>In this lesson, you will revisit the idea that not all systems of linear equations have a single solution. Next, you will investigate different ways to determine the number of solutions to a system of linear equations.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Determine how many solutions a system of equations could have. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2.7.1: Systems of Linear Equations with Infinitely Many Solutions</li>
  <li>2.7.2: Systems of Linear Equations with No Solution<ul>
      <li>2.7.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>
      <li>2.7.2: Additional Resources</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>2.7.3: Sorting Systems of Equations Based on Number of Solutions<ul>
      <li>2.7.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>
      <li>2.7.3: Additional Resources</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>2.7.4: Writing Consistent and Inconsistent Systems of Equations</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>
