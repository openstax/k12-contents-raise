<h2>Activity (10 minutes)</h2>
</div>
</div>
<div class="activities">
<div class="body">
<p>This activity gives students an opportunity to examine multiple quantities and relationships in a geometric context and to use letters to represent quantities.</p>
<p>As students analyze the number of faces, vertices, and edges in several Platonic solids and try to identify relationships, they practice looking for structure. Some of the relationships could be represented by inequalities. One particular relationship can be represented by equations, setting the stage for upcoming work on equivalent equations.</p>
<p>If work time is coming to an end and no students are able to find an equation that relates the parts of the Platonic solids, suggest that students try adding the vertices and faces in each row.</p>
</div>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<div class="body">
<p>Ask students to keep their books or devices closed.</p>
<p>Display the images of the three Platonic solids. If physical polyhedra are available, consider displaying them as well. Ask students: &ldquo;In what ways are the three figures alike? In what ways are they different?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Students may say that the figures are alike in that:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are all three-dimensional figures.</li>
<li>Each Platonic solid has only one kind of polygon for its faces (triangle for the tetrahedron, square for the cube, and pentagon for the dodecahedron).</li>
<li>The faces of each figure seem to be regular polygons (or polygons whose sides are equal in length).</li>
<li>They all have an even number of faces, vertices, and edges.</li>
</ul>
<p>They may say that the figures are different in that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each figure has a different polygon for its faces (a triangle for the tetrahedron, a square for the cube, and a pentagon for the dodecahedron).</li>
<li>They all have a different number of faces, vertices, and edges.</li>
</ul>
<p>If students refer to edges and vertices as &ldquo;lines&rdquo; and &ldquo;points,&rdquo; ask if they remember the &ldquo;math names&rdquo; for these things. Review the terms <em>vertices</em>, <em>edges</em>, and<em> faces </em>as needed.</p>
<p>Tell students that they will now investigate the relationships between the faces, vertices, and edges in each polyhedron.</p>

              <ul>
<li>The number of edges is greater than both the number of faces and the number of vertices.</li>

<h3>Student-Facing Extension</h3>
<h4>Are you ready for more?</h4>
<div class="body">
<p>There are two more Platonic solids: an octahedron, which has 8 faces that are all triangles, and an icosahedron, which has 20 faces that are all triangles.</p>
<ol>
<li>How many edges would each of these solids have? (Keep in mind that each edge is used in two faces.)
            </li>
<li>Use your discoveries from the activity to determine how many vertices each of these solids would have.
            </li>
<li>For all 5 Platonic solids, determine how many faces meet at each vertex.
            </li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Extension Student Response</h3>
<div class="body">
<ol>
<li>The octahedron has 12 edges. The icosahedron has 30 edges.</li>
<li>The octahedron has 6 vertices. The icosahedron has 12 vertices.</li>
<li>The tetrahedron, cube, and dodecahedron have 3 faces meeting at each vertex. The octahedron has 4 faces meeting at each vertex. The icosahedron has 5 faces meeting at each vertex.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>
<div class="body">
<p>Some students may get the terms <em>vertex</em>, <em>face</em>, and <em>edge</em> confused. As students work on the activity, check to make sure that they understand what should be counted.</p>
<p>Some students may see the relationship between vertices, edges, and faces, but they may be unsure of how to express that relationship using an equation. If students can express in words something like, &ldquo;you always get two more,&rdquo; ask them to try writing an equation that might be correct. Then suggest that they test the equation for one of the solids. If it doesn&rsquo;t work, ask them to make changes to the equation until it works.</p>
</div>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<div class="body">
<p>Invite students to share their observations about the quantities and relationships in the table. Some of the hypotheses students make about the relationships might not be true for all Platonic solids. For now, it is sufficient that they are supported by the values in the table.</p>
<p>Next, elicit the relationship between the quantities that could be represented by <span class="math math-repaired">\( V + F - 2 = E \)</span>. Record and display all correct <span>equations</span> for all to see. If students produce only one correct equation, introduce a variant such as <span class="math math-repaired">\( V+F-E=2 \)</span> or <span class="math math-repaired">\( V+F-E-2=0 \)</span>. Ask students whether these equations all represent the same relationship and how they know. Students can simply show that each equation captures the pattern in the table. It is not necessary for them to articulate why the equations are equivalent because they will have many opportunities to do so in upcoming lessons.</p>

<h3>Writing Equations Using Symbols</h3>
<p>Here are two more examples of writing statements algebraically using symbols.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>We want to express the following statement using symbolic language:&nbsp;<br><span>The sum&nbsp;</span><span>of three consecutive integers is 372.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Do the first step, and hold up your whiteboard.<ul>
<li>Let&nbsp;\( x \) be the first integer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If we let \( x \) represent the first integer, what do we need to do to get the next&nbsp;<span>consecutive integer?</span>
<ul>
<li>If \( x \) is the first integer, we add 1 to \( x \) to get the next integer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In symbols, the next integer would be \(&nbsp;𝑥 + 1&nbsp;\). What do we need to do now to get the next consecutive integer?<ul>
<li>We need to add 1 to that integer, or \(&nbsp;𝑥 + 1+ 1&nbsp;\); this is the same as \(&nbsp;𝑥 +2&nbsp;\).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now, express the statement: The sum of three consecutive integers is 372.</li>
<ul>
<li>\(&nbsp;𝑥 + 𝑥 +1 + 𝑥 + 2 = 372&nbsp;\)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong><br></p>
<p>We want to express the following statement using symbolic language: <br>The sum&nbsp;<span>of three consecutive odd integers is 93.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Do the first step, and hold up your whiteboard.<ul>
<li>Let \( x \) be the first odd integer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If we let \( x \) represent the first odd integer, what do we need to do to get the next&nbsp;<span>odd integer?</span>
<ul>
<li>If \( x \) is the first odd integer, we add 2 to \( x \) to get the next odd integer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In symbols, the next odd integer would be \(&nbsp;𝑥 + 2&nbsp;\). What do we need to do now to get the next odd integer?<ul>
<li>We need to add 2 to that odd integer, or \(&nbsp;𝑥 + 2 +2&nbsp;\); this is the same as \(&nbsp;𝑥 + 4&nbsp;\).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now, express the statement: The sum of three consecutive odd integers is 93.<ul>
<li>\(&nbsp;𝑥 + 𝑥 +2 + 𝑥 + 4 = 93&nbsp;\)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Represent the statement &ldquo;The sum of three consecutive odd integers is 93&rdquo; in another way. Be prepared to&nbsp;<span>explain why both are correct.</span>
<ul>
<li>Answers will vary. Accept any correct answers and justifications. For example, students may write \(&nbsp;𝑥 + 𝑥 + 𝑥 + 6 = 93&nbsp;\)&nbsp;<span>and state that it is equivalent to the equation \( 𝑥 +𝑥 +2 + 𝑥 + 4 = 93 \). Because&nbsp;</span><span>the associative and commutative properties of addition were applied, those properties do not change&nbsp;</span><span>the value of an expression.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Try It: Writing Equations Using Symbols</h3>
<p><span>Now it&rsquo;s your turn. Write the statement below algebraically using symbols.</span></p>
