      <div class="body">
        <p>This activity gives students an opportunity to examine multiple quantities and relationships in a geometric context and to use letters to represent quantities.</p>
        <p>As students analyze the number of faces, vertices, and edges in several Platonic solids and try to identify relationships, they practice looking for structure. Some of the relationships could be represented by inequalities. One particular relationship can be represented by equations, setting the stage for upcoming work on equivalent equations.</p>
        <p>If work time is coming to an end and no students are able to find an equation that relates the parts of the Platonic solids, suggest that students try adding the vertices and faces in each row.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Launch</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>Ask students to keep their books or devices closed.</p>
        <p>Display the images of the three Platonic solids. If physical polyhedra are available, consider displaying them as well. Ask students: &ldquo;In what ways are the three figures alike? In what ways are they different?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Students may say that the figures are alike in that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>They are all three-dimensional figures.</li>
          <li>Each Platonic solid has only one kind of polygon for its faces (triangle for the tetrahedron, square for the cube, and pentagon for the dodecahedron).</li>
          <li>The faces of each figure seem to be regular polygons (or polygons whose sides are equal in length).</li>
          <li>They all have an even number of faces, vertices, and edges.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>They may say that the figures are different in that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Each figure has a different polygon for its faces (a triangle for the tetrahedron, a square for the cube, and a pentagon for the dodecahedron).</li>
          <li>They all have a different number of faces, vertices, and edges.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If students refer to edges and vertices as &ldquo;lines&rdquo; and &ldquo;points,&rdquo; ask if they remember the &ldquo;math names&rdquo; for these things. Review the terms <em>vertices</em>, <em>edges</em>, and<em> faces </em>as needed.</p>
        <p>Tell students that they will now investigate the relationships between the faces, vertices, and edges in each polyhedron.</p>

        <h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>
        <div class="body">
          <p>Some students may get the terms <em>vertex</em>, <em>face</em>, and <em>edge</em> confused. As students work on the activity, check to make sure that they understand what should be counted.</p>
          <p>Some students may see the relationship between vertices, edges, and faces, but they may be unsure of how to express that relationship using an equation. If students can express in words something like, &ldquo;you always get two more,&rdquo; ask them to try writing an equation that might be correct. Then suggest that they test the equation for one of the solids. If it doesn&rsquo;t work, ask them to make changes to the equation until it works.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
        <div class="body">
          <p>Invite students to share their observations about the quantities and relationships in the table. Some of the hypotheses students make about the relationships might not be true for all Platonic solids. For now, it is sufficient that they are supported by the values in the table.</p>
          <p>Next, elicit the relationship between the quantities that could be represented by <span class="math math-repaired">\( V + F - 2 = E \)</span>. Record and display all correct <span>equations</span> for all to see. If students produce only one correct equation, introduce a variant such as <span class="math math-repaired">\( V+F-E=2 \)</span> or <span class="math math-repaired">\( V+F-E-2=0 \)</span>. Ask students whether these equations all represent the same relationship and how they know. Students can simply show that each equation captures the pattern in the table. It is not necessary for them to articulate why the equations are equivalent because they will have many opportunities to do so in upcoming lessons.</p>

  <h3>Writing Equations Using Symbols</h3>

 <p> When writing statements using algebraic symbols, the following steps may be helpful. </p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Read the problem. <br>
<strong>Step 2</strong> - Identify the variables and known values. If needed, sketch a picture of the scenario.<br>
<strong>Step 3</strong> - Write a sentence using the relationship among the values. <br>
<strong>Step 4</strong> - Translate the sentence into an equation.</p>

<p>Remember that <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">variables</span> represent values in the problem that can change.</p>

<p>Let's examine two examples of how to write statements algebraically using symbols. </p>


  <p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
  <p>We want to express the following statement using symbolic language:&nbsp;<br><span>The sum&nbsp;</span><span>of three consecutive integers is 372.</span></p>

<p> <strong>Step 1 </strong> - Read the problem. <br>
  The sum of three consecutive integers is 372. </p>

<p><strong>Step 2 </strong> - Identify the variables and known values. If needed, sketch a picture of the scenario.</p>

<p> Let \( x \) = the first integer. There are two more numbers that follow \( x \). <br>
Each number is 1 more than the number before it: \(x + 1\) and \(x + 2\) <br>
The sum of all three numbers is 372.
</p>

<img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/dde7b58e23c5555930c3d2a06a33cfe3418f9f5f" height="120"></a>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Write a sentence using the relationship among the values. <br>
  The sum of \(x\), \(x+1\), and \(x+2\) is 372.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Translate the sentence into an equation. <br>
\(x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 372\)
\(3x + 3 = 372\)
</p>


  
  <p><strong>Example 2</strong><br></p>
  <p>We want to express the following statement using symbolic language: <br>The sum&nbsp;<span>of three consecutive odd integers is 93.</span></p>
  
  <p> <strong>Step 1 </strong> - Read the problem. <br>
    The sum of three consecutive integers is 93. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 2 </strong> - Identify the variables and known values. If needed, sketch a picture of the scenario.</p>
  
  <p> Let \(x\) = the first integer. There are two more ODD numbers that follow \(x\). <br>
    Each number is 2 more than the number before it: \(x + 2\) and \(x + 4\) <br>
    The sum of all three numbers is 93.
  </p>
  
  <img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/253d151822d1b5afe49f1825ecf98d34e5b4768d" height="150"></a>
  
  <p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Write a sentence using the relationship among the values. <br>
    The sum of \(x\), \(x+2\), and \(x+4\) is 93.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Translate the sentence into an equation. <br>
    \(x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 93\)
    \(3x + 6 = 93\)
  </p>
