<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>

<p>This activity gives students an opportunity to examine multiple quantities and relationships in a geometric context
  and to use letters to represent quantities.</p>
<p>As students analyze the number of faces, vertices, and edges in several Platonic solids and try to identify
  relationships, they practice looking for structure. Some of the relationships could be represented by inequalities.
  One particular relationship can be represented by equations, setting the stage for upcoming work on equivalent
  equations.</p>
<p>If work time is coming to an end and no students are able to find an equation that relates the parts of the Platonic
  solids, suggest that students try adding the vertices and faces in each row.</p>

<h4>Launch</h4>

<p>Ask students to keep their books or devices closed.</p>
<p>Display the images of the three Platonic solids. If physical polyhedra are available, consider displaying them as
  well. Ask students: &ldquo;In what ways are the three figures alike? In what ways are they different?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Students may say that the figures are alike in that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They are all three-dimensional figures.</li>
  <li>Each Platonic solid has only one kind of polygon for its faces (triangle for the tetrahedron, square for the cube,
    and pentagon for the dodecahedron).</li>
  <li>The faces of each figure seem to be regular polygons (or polygons whose sides are equal in length).</li>
  <li>They all have an even number of faces, vertices, and edges.</li>
</ul>
<p>They may say that the figures are different in that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each figure has a different polygon for its faces (a triangle for the tetrahedron, a square for the cube, and a
    pentagon for the dodecahedron).</li>
  <li>They all have a different number of faces, vertices, and edges.</li>
</ul>
<p>If students refer to edges and vertices as &ldquo;lines&rdquo; and &ldquo;points,&rdquo; ask if they remember the
  &ldquo;math names&rdquo; for these things. Review the terms <em>vertices</em>, <em>edges</em>, and<em> faces </em>as
  needed.</p>
<p>Tell students that they will now investigate the relationships between the faces, vertices, and edges in each
  polyhedron.</p>

<p>The table shows the number of faces, vertices, and edges for the tetrahedron and dodecahedron.</p>
<p>Determine the following values regarding the cube.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="1">
  <li> Number of faces. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 6</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li> Number of edges. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 8</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li> Number of vertices. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 12</p>
<p>There are some interesting relationships between the number of faces (\( F \)), edges (\( E \)), and vertices (\( V
  \)) in all Platonic solids. </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>What do you notice about the relationships between the numbers of faces, edges, and vertices of the Platonic
    solids?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here are some examples.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I noticed all the numbers are even.</li>
  <li>I noticed the number of faces is less than or equal to the number of vertices, or \(F \leq V\)</li>
  <li>I noticed the number of edges is always greater than the number of faces, or \(E \gt F\).</li>
</ul>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>What do you wonder about the relationships between the numbers of faces, edges, and vertices of the Platonic
    solids? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here are some examples.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I wonder if the number of edges is always less than the sum of the number of faces and the number of vertices, or
    \(E \lt F + V\). </li>
  <li>I wonder if there is an equation that connects all of the variables.</li>
</ul>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
  <li> There is a relationship that can be expressed with an equation using all three values: \(F, V, E\). Write the
    equation that represents how the three values are related.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The number of edges is 2 less than the sum of the other two numbers, or \(V + F - 2 = E\).
</p>
<h4>Student Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>There are two more Platonic solids: an octahedron, which has 8 faces that are all triangles, and an icosahedron,
  which has 20 faces that are all triangles.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="1">
  <li>How many edges would each of these solids have? (Keep in mind that each edge is used in two faces.)</li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a" start="1">
  <li>The octahedron has how many edges? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The octahedron has 12 edges.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a" start="2">
  <li>The icosahedron has how many edges? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The icosahedron has 30 edges.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Use your discoveries from the activity to determine how many vertices each of these solids would have.</li>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The octahedron has 6 vertices.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a" start="2">
  <li>The icosahedron has how many vertices? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The icosahedron has 30 vertices.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>For all 5 Platonic solids, determine how many faces meet at each vertex.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The tetrahedron, cube, and dodecahedron have 3 faces meeting at each vertex. The octahedron
  has 4 faces meeting at each vertex. The icosahedron has 5 faces meeting at each vertex.</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may get the terms <em>vertex</em>, <em>face</em>, and <em>edge</em> confused. As students work on the
  activity, check to make sure that they understand what should be counted.</p>
<p>Some students may see the relationship between vertices, edges, and faces, but they may be unsure of how to express
  that relationship using an equation. If students can express in words something like, &ldquo;you always get two
  more,&rdquo; ask them to try writing an equation that might be correct. Then suggest that they test the equation for
  one of the solids. If it doesn&rsquo;t work, ask them to make changes to the equation until it works.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their observations about the quantities and relationships in the table. Some of the
  hypotheses students make about the relationships might not be true for all Platonic solids. For now, it is sufficient
  that they are supported by the values in the table.</p>
<p>Next, elicit the relationship between the quantities that could be represented by <span class="math math-repaired">\(
    V + F - 2 = E \)</span>. Record and display all correct <span>equations</span> for all to see. If students produce
  only one correct equation, introduce a variant such as <span class="math math-repaired">\( V+F-E=2 \)</span> or <span
    class="math math-repaired">\( V+F-E-2=0 \)</span>. Ask students whether these equations all represent the same
  relationship and how they know. Students can simply show that each equation captures the pattern in the table. It is
  not necessary for them to articulate why the equations are equivalent because they will have many opportunities to do
  so in upcoming lessons.</p>

<h4>Writing Equations Using Symbols</h4>
<p> When writing statements using algebraic symbols, the following steps may be helpful. </p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Read the problem. <br>
  <strong>Step 2</strong> - Identify the variables and known values. If needed, sketch a picture of the scenario.<br>
  <strong>Step 3</strong> - Write a sentence using the relationship among the values. <br>
  <strong>Step 4</strong> - Translate the sentence into an equation.
</p>
<p>Remember that <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0"
    data-store="glossary-tooltip">variables</span> represent values in the problem that can change.</p>
<p>Let's examine two examples of how to write statements algebraically using symbols. </p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>We want to express the following statement using symbolic language:&nbsp;<br><span>The sum&nbsp;</span><span>of three
    consecutive integers is 372.</span></p>
<p> <strong>Step 1 </strong> - Read the problem. <br>
  The sum of three consecutive integers is 372. </p>
<p><strong>Step 2 </strong> - Identify the variables and known values. If needed, sketch a picture of the scenario.</p>
<p> Let \( x \) = the first integer. There are two more numbers that follow \( x \). <br>
  Each number is 1 more than the number before it: \(x + 1\) and \(x + 2\) <br>
  The sum of all three numbers is 372.
</p>
<img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/dde7b58e23c5555930c3d2a06a33cfe3418f9f5f" height="120"></a>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Write a sentence using the relationship among the values. <br>
  The sum of \(x\), \(x+1\), and \(x+2\) is 372.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Translate the sentence into an equation. <br>
  \(x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 372\)
  \(3x + 3 = 372\)
</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 2</p>
<p>We want to express the following statement using symbolic language: <br>The sum&nbsp;<span>of three consecutive odd
    integers is 93.</span></p>

<p> <strong>Step 1 </strong> - Read the problem. <br>
  The sum of three consecutive integers is 93. </p>
<p><strong>Step 2 </strong> - Identify the variables and known values. If needed, sketch a picture of the scenario.</p>
<p> Let \(x\) = the first integer. There are two more ODD numbers that follow \(x\). <br>
  Each number is 2 more than the number before it: \(x + 2\) and \(x + 4\) <br>
  The sum of all three numbers is 93.
</p>
<img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/253d151822d1b5afe49f1825ecf98d34e5b4768d" height="150"></a>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Write a sentence using the relationship among the values. <br>
  The sum of \(x\), \(x+2\), and \(x+4\) is 93.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Translate the sentence into an equation. <br>
  \(x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 93\)
  \(3x + 6 = 93\)
</p>
<h4>Try It: Writing Equations Using Symbols</h4>
<p><span>Now it&rsquo;s your turn. Write the statement below algebraically using symbols.</span></p>
<p>The sum of three consecutive integers is 1,623.</p>
<p><span>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</span><br></p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p><span>Here is how to express this statement using symbols.</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( x+x+1+x+2=1,623 \)</p>
<p>\(3x+3 = 1,623\)</p>
