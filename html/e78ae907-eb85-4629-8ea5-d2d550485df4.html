<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>Previously, students used simple quadratic functions to describe how an object falls over time, given the effect of gravity. In this lesson, they build on that understanding and construct quadratic functions to represent projectile motions. Along the way, they learn about the zeros of a function and the vertex of a graph. They also begin to consider appropriate domains for a function, given the situation it represents.</p>
<p>Students use a linear model to describe the height of an object that is launched directly upward at a constant speed. Because of the influence of gravity, however, the object will not continue to travel at a constant rate. Eventually it will stop going higher and will start falling, so the model will have to be adjusted. They notice that this phenomenon can be represented with a quadratic function and that adding a squared term to the linear term seems to &ldquo;bend&rdquo; the graph and change its direction.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Create graphs of quadratic functions that represent a physical phenomenon and determine an appropriate domain when graphing. </li>
  <li> Identify and interpret (orally and in writing) the meaning of the vertex of a graph and the zeros of a function represented in tables and graphs. </li>
  <li> Write and interpret (orally and in writing) quadratic functions that represent a physical phenomenon. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Create quadratic functions and graphs that represent a situation. </li>
  <li> Relate the vertex of a graph and the zeros of a function to a situation. </li>
  <li> Know that the domain of a function can depend on the situation it represents. </li>
</ul>
