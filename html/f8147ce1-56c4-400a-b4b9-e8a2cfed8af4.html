<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm up highlights the three forms of quadratic expressions students have seen so far. It reinforces how each form gives different insights into the graph of a quadratic function.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Give students a minute of quiet think time, and then ask them to share their thinking with a partner.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Expressions in different forms can be used to define the same function. Here are three ways to define a function \(f\).</p>

<p>Which form would you use if you want to find the following features of the graph of \(f\)? Be prepared to explain your reasoning.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>The \(x\)-intercepts</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li> Standard form </li>
  <li> Factored form </li>
  <li> Vertex form </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Factored form</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>The vertex</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li> Standard form </li>
  <li> Factored form </li>
  <li> Vertex form </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Vertex form</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>The \(y\)-intercept</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li> Standard form </li>
  <li> Factored form </li>
  <li> Vertex form </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Standard form</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their responses and explanations. Encourage students to name specific features of the graph of \(f\). If time permits, consider asking students to use all of the info they can gather to sketch a graph.</p>
<p>If not already mentioned by students, point out that while the standard form allows us to find the \(y\)-intercept more readily, the \(y\)-intercept can always be found by evaluating the function at \(x=0\).</p>
