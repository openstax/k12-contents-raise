<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>Noah is having trouble solving two equations. In each case, he took steps that he thought were acceptable but ended
  up with statements that are clearly not true.</p>
<p>Analyze Noah&rsquo;s work on each equation and the moves he made. Were they acceptable moves? Why do you think he
  ended up with a false equation?</p>
<p>Discuss your observations with your group and be prepared to share your conclusions. If you get stuck, consider
  solving each equation.</p>
<div class="os-raise-d-flex os-raise-justify-content-between">
  <p><strong>Example 1</strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Step 1 - </strong>Original equation.<br>
    \( x+6 =4x+1-3x \)<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Step 2 - </strong>Apply the Commutative Property.<br>
    \( x+6 =4x-3x+1 \)<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Step 3 - </strong>Combine like terms.<br>
    \( x+6 =x+1 \)<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Step 4 - </strong>Subtract \(x\) from each side.<br>
    \( 6 =1 \)
  </p>
  <p><strong>Example 2</strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Step 1 - </strong>Original equation.<br>
    \( 2(5+x)-1=3x+9 \)<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Step 2 - </strong>Apply the Distributive Property.<br>
    \( 10+2x-1 =3x+9 \)<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Step 3 - </strong>Subtract 10 from each side.<br>
    &nbsp;\( 2x-1 =3x-1 \)<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Step 4 - </strong>Add 1 to each side.<br>
    \( 2x=3x \)<br>

    <p> Your answer may vary, but here is an example: <br>
      All the moves that Noah made were acceptable, but because he ended up with a false statement, that means there is no value of \(x\) that makes the first equation true. We can see it in the third line: \(x+6=x+1\). There is no number that can make the equation true.</p>

    <p> Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. </p><br>
    <p>Example 1: All the moves that Noah made were acceptable, but because he ended up with a false statement, that
      means there is no value of \( x \) that makes the first equation true. We can see it in the third line: \( x + 6 =
      x + 1 \). There is no number that can make the equation true.</p><br>
    <p>Example 2: Noah's moves seem acceptable except for the last one. If he had subtracted \( 2x \) from each side of
      the equation, he would have \( 0 = x \). Instead, he divided both sides by \( x \) which would give an undefined
      number if \( x\;\;is\;\;0 \).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Noah tried to solve a third equation and ended up with a true statement, without variables.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 1 - </strong>Original equation.<br></p>
    <p>\( 2 (4 + x) - 2 = 2x + 6 \)</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Apply the Distributive Property.<br></p>
    <p>\( 8+ 2x - 2 =2x + 6 \)</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3 - </strong>Combine Like Terms.<br></p>
    <p>\( 2x +6 = 2x +6 \)</p>
    <p><strong>Step 4 - </strong>Subtract 6 from both sides.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>\( 2x = 2x \)</p>
    <p><strong>Step 5 - </strong>Subtract \(2x\) from both sides.<br></p>
    <p>\( 0=0 \) </p>
    <br>
    <p>Since there is not a variable and the statement is true, any value of \(x\) would be a solution for the original equation. So, this equation has infinitely many solutions.</p><br>

    <p>1. We cannot divide the number 100 by zero because dividing by zero is undefined. Instead, try dividing 100 by 10, then 1, then 0.1, then 0.01. What do you notice happens as you divide by smaller numbers? </p>
