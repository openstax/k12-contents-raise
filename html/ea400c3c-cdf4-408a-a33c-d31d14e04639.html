<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>For each pair of variables, decide whether there is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a very weak or no relationship</li>
  <li>a strong relationship that is not a causal relationship</li>
  <li>a causal relationship</li>
</ul>
<p>Be prepared to show your reasoning.</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Number of snow plows owned by a city and mitten sales in the city</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>a very weak or no relationship</li>
  <li>a strong relationship that is not a causal relationship</li>
  <li>a causal relationship</li>
</ul> 
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>A strong relationship that is not a causal relationship. </p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Explain the reasoning for your answer to question 1.</li>
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>You answer may vary, but here is s a sample. </p>
  <p>A strong relationship that is not a causal relationship. The variables
  are related since cities with more snow plows will probably also have
  high sales of mittens compared to places with fewer snow plows. The
  climate, number of people living in the city, and amount of snow all
  affect both of these variables. A city having extra snow plows would not
  cause people to buy more mittens, nor would the reverse happen.</p>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Number of text messages sent per day by a person and number of shirts owned by the person</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>a very weak or no relationship</li>
  <li>a strong relationship that is not a causal relationship</li>
  <li>a causal relationship</li>
</ul> 
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>A very weak or no relationship. </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>Explain the reasoning for your answer to question 3.</li>
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>You answer may vary, but here is s a sample. </p>
  <p>A very weak or no relationship. These variables seem unrelated, and there is not another
    variable like age or wealth that would seem to be related to both of
    these variables consistently.</p>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>Price of a pizza and number of calories in the pizza</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>a very weak or no relationship</li>
  <li>a strong relationship that is not a causal relationship</li>
  <li>a causal relationship</li>
</ul> 
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>A strong relationship that is not a causal relationship. </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
  <li>Explain the reasoning for your answer to question 5.</li>
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>You answer may vary, but here is s a sample. </p>
  <p>A strong relationship that is
    not a causal relationship. The variables are related since a more
    expensive pizza will generally be larger or have more toppings, leading
    to more calories, but it is the size or number of toppings that is the
    cause for the increase in both variables.</p>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="7">
  <li>Amount of gas used on a trip and number of miles driven on the trip</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>a very weak or no relationship</li>
  <li>a strong relationship that is not a causal relationship</li>
  <li>a causal relationship</li>
</ul> 
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>A causal relationship. </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="8">
  <li>Explain the reasoning for your answer to question 7.</li>
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>You answer may vary, but here is s a sample. </p>
  <p>Causal relationship. Longer trips will cause greater gas consumption, and shorter trips will require less gas.</p>
</ol>

<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>Points to Emphasize</h5>
<p>If students struggle to describe relationships between variables, spend
  the first five minutes of Lesson 3.6.4 highlighting key ideas from
  cool downs in Lessons 3.6.1 through 3.6.3 for students to focus on during their work in
  Lesson 3.6.4.</p>
