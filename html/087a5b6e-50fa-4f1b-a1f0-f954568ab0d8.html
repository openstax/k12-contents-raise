<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm-up reminds students about systems of equations and their solutions. Students recall that a solution to a linear equation in two variables is any pair of numbers that makes the equation true, and that a solution to a system of two equations in two variables is a pair of numbers that makes both equations true.</p>
<p>The given system has a solution that is hard to find mentally, but it can be calculated algebraically or by using graphing technology.</p>
<p>Encourage students to attempt to solve the problem algebraically using elimination or another method before introducing graphing technology as a method to determine the solution.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Students can share their answers to the riddle with their partner. Did they come up with the same answer? Use the questions in the activity synthesis to further facilitate discussion.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>For questions 1â€“4, use the following scenario to use equations to solve a riddle:</p>
<blockquote>Here is a riddle: &ldquo;I am thinking of two numbers that add up to 5.678. The difference between them is 9.876. What are the two numbers?&rdquo;</blockquote>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Name any pair of numbers whose sum is \(5.678\).<br><br>
       <strong>Answer: </strong>\(2\) and \(3.678\)<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>Name any pair of numbers whose difference is \(9.876\).<br><br>
     <strong>Answer: </strong>\(10\) and \(0.124\)<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>The riddle can be represented with two equations. Write the equations.<br><br>
    <strong>Answer: </strong>Let \(x\) and \(y\) represent the numbers: \(x+y=5.678\) and \(x-y=9.876\).<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>Solve the riddle. Be prepared to show your reasoning.<br><br>
    <strong>Answer: </strong>The two numbers are \(7.777\) and \(-2.099\).<br><br>
   </li> 
    <ul>
      <li>Adding the two equations eliminates the \(y\)-variable and gives \(2x=15.554\) or \(x=7.777\). </li>
      <li>Substituting this \(x\)-value into either equation gives \(y=-2.099\).</li>
    </ul>

<h4><span>Anticipated Misconceptions</span></h4>
<p><span>Students who graph the system of equations using technology may estimate from the graph and offer \((8, -2)\) as a solution. Ask them to check whether \(8 + (-2)\) really does equal 5.678.</span></p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Ask students using different methods to briefly describe their solving process. Record and display their reasoning (including a graph) for all to see.<br></p>
<p>If not mentioned in students&rsquo; explanations, highlight that the riddle can be solved by writing and solving a system of equations. Each equation represents a constraint. Ask students:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span>&ldquo;What constraints do the two equations represent?&rdquo; (The first equation represents a constraint about the sum of the two numbers. The second represents a constraint about the difference of the two numbers.)</span></li>
  <li><span>&ldquo;What does a solution to the system represent?&rdquo; (The solution is a pair of numbers that simultaneously meets both constraints or makes both equations true.)</span></li>
  <li><span>&ldquo;How many pairs of numbers meet both constraints at the same time?&rdquo; (Only one pair. The graphs of the equations intersect at one point.)</span></li>
</ul>
