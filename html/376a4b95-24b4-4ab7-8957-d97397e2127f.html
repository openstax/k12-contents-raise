<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>This lesson focuses on factoring two different special products. Perfect square trinomials follow the pattern \(a^2 \pm 2ab + b^2\) and factor to \((a + b)^2\) or \((a &minus; b)^2\), depending on the sign of the middle term in the trinomial.</p>
<p>The difference of squares is represented by the binomial \(a^2 &minus; b^2\) and factors to the conjugate pair \((a &minus; b)(a + b)\).</p>
<p>Recognizing the patterns of these special products will allow for the easy factoring of these particular cases.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Recognize the patterns of perfect square trinomials and factor them into the form \((a + b)^2\) or \((a &minus; b)^2\). </li>
<li> Recognize the difference of squares and factor them into conjugate pairs. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
<li> Factor perfect square trinomials. </li>
<li> Factor differences of squares. </li>
</ul>
