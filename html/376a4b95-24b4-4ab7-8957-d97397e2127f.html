<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>This lesson focuses on factoring two different special products. Perfect square trinomials follow the pattern \(a^2
  \pm 2ab + b^2\) and factor to \((a + b)^2\) or \((a &minus; b)^2\), depending on the sign of the middle term in the
  trinomial.</p>
<p>The difference of squares is represented by the binomial \(a^2 &minus; b^2\) and factors to the conjugate pair \((a
  &minus; b)(a + b)\).</p>
<p>Recognizing the patterns of these special products will allow for the easy factoring of these particular cases.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Recognize the patterns of perfect square trinomials and factor them into the form \((a + b)^2\) or \((a &minus;
    b)^2\). </li>
  <li> Recognize the difference of squares and factor them into conjugate pairs. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Factor perfect square trinomials. </li>
  <li> Factor differences of squares. </li>
</ul>

    <p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are
  only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.
  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines. </p>
<ul>
  <li>ELPS 1(E) internalize new basic and academic language by using and reusing it in meaningful ways in speaking and
    writing activities that build concept and language attainment</li>
  <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and
    reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
  <li>ELPS 3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions</li>
  <li>ELPS 3(G) express opinions, ideas, and feelings ranging from communicating single words and short phrases to
    participating in extended discussions on a variety of social and grade-appropriate academic topics</li>
  <li>ELPS 3(H) narrate, describe, and explain with increasing specificity and detail as more English is acquired</li>
  <li>ELPS 3(I) adapt spoken language appropriately for formal and informal purposes</li>
