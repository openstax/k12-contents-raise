<p>In this lesson, you will write, solve, and graph linear inequalities in two variables.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Determine which side of the line the solutions to the inequality will fall, given a two-variable inequality and the graph of the related equation.</li>
  <li>Describe the graph that represents the solutions to a linear inequality in two variables.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals: </p>
