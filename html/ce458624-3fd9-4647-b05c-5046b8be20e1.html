<h4>Analyzing and Responding to Data</h4>
<p>The following sections provide guidance for how to use the components in this course to interpret and respond to student performance.</p>
<h4>How to Assess Progress</h4>
<p>The materials contain many opportunities and tools for both formative and summative assessment. Some things are purely formative, but the tools that can be used for summative assessment can also be used formatively.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Each unit begins with an Overview and Readiness assessment of concepts and skills that are prerequisite to the unit. </li>
  <li> Each instructional task is accompanied by commentary about expected student responses and potential misconceptions so that teachers can adjust their instruction depending on what students are doing in response to the task. Often there are suggested questions to help teachers better understand students' thinking. </li>
  <li> Each lesson includes a cool-down (analogous to an exit slip or exit ticket) to assess whether students understood the work of that day's lesson. Teachers may use this as a formative assessment to provide feedback or to plan further instruction. </li>
  <li> A set of practice problems is provided for each lesson that can be assigned for homework or in-class practice. The teacher can provide feedback to students as they work on the problems in class or identify specific problems to discuss in small groups or a full class setting when several students struggle with the same problem. </li>
  <li> Each unit includes an end-of-unit quiz intended for students to complete individually to assess what they have learned at the conclusion of the unit. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Overview and Readiness Assessments</h4>
<p>At the start of each unit is a pre-unit diagnostic assessment titled Unit Overview and Readiness. These assessments consist of three questions. Most of the problems address prerequisite concepts and skills for the unit. Teachers can use these problems to identify students with particular below-grade needs, or topics to carefully address during the unit. The Overview and Readiness also may include problems that assess what students already know of the upcoming unit's key ideas, which teachers can use to pace or tune instruction; in rare cases, this may signal the opportunity to move more quickly through a topic to optimize instructional time.</p>

<!-- Accordion Item #-->
<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> What if a large number of students can't do the same pre-unit assessment problem?</button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>Teachers are encouraged to address below-grade skills while continuing to work through the on-grade tasks and concepts of each unit, instead of abandoning the current work in favor of material that only addresses below-grade skills. Look for opportunities within the upcoming unit where the target skill could be addressed in context. For example, an upcoming activity might require solving an equation in one variable. Some strategies might include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> ask a student who can do the skill to present their method </li>
      <li> add additional questions to the warm-up with the purpose of revisiting the skill </li>
      <li> add to the activity launch a few related equations to solve, before students need to solve an equation while working on the activity </li>
      <li> pause the class while working on the activity to focus on the portion that requires solving an equation </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then, attend carefully to students as they work through the activity. If difficulty persists, add more opportunities to practice the skill, by adapting tasks or practice problems.</p>
    <p>Teachers may also choose to use the OpenStax Pre-algebra content provided with each unit for use in small group instruction or intensive remediation. This content can be shared with students prior to entering the unit or shared with colleagues who also support the students.</p>

<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> What if all students do really well on Check Your Readiness?</button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>That means they are ready for the work ahead, and special attention doesn't likely need to be paid to below-grade skills.</p>

<h4>Cool Down Activities</h4>
<p>Each lesson includes a cool down activity for students to complete at the end of the lesson. This activity serves as a brief checkpoint to determine whether students understood the main concepts of that lesson. Teachers can use this as a formative assessment to plan further instruction.</p>
<br>
<!-- Accordion Item #3-->
<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> What if the feedback from a cool-down suggests students haven't understood a key concept?</button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>Choose one or more of these strategies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Look at the next few lessons to see if students have more opportunities to engage with the same topic. If so, plan to focus on the topic in the context of the new activities. </li>
      <li> During the next lesson, ask students to discuss or display their thinking from that cool down. Also show examples of incorrect work. In these incorrect responses, ask the class to identify some things that were completed correctly in the problem and where the mistake or misunderstanding occurred. Have them describe how to complete the problem correctly and then compare it to the prior correct response(s). </li>
      <li> Look for practice problems that are similar to, or involve the same topic as the cool down, then re-assign those problems over the next few lessons. </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<h4>End-of-Unit Assessments</h4>
<p>At the end of each unit is the Unit Quiz. These assessments have a specific length and breadth, with problem types that are intended to gauge students' understanding of the key concepts of the unit while also preparing students for standardized exams. Problems vary in difficulty and depth of knowledge.</p>
<p>Teachers may choose to grade these assessments in a standardized fashion, but may also choose to grade more formatively by asking students to show and explain their work on all problems.</p>
<p>Also provided at the end of each unit is the Unit STAAR Quiz. This quiz consists of released STAAR items so it directly mimics the type of assessment on the End of Course exam. In contrast to the Unit Quiz, the questions are cumulative and cover content from the current unit as well as prior units.</p>
<p>Students should get the correct answer on assessment problems for the right reasons, and get incorrect answers for the right reasons. To help with this, the assessment problems are targeted and short, use consistent, positive wording, and have clear, undebatable correct responses.</p>
<p>In these multiple-choice problems, distractors are common errors and misconceptions directly relating to what is being assessed, since problems are intended to test whether the student has proficiency on a specific skill. The distractors serve as a diagnostic, giving teachers the chance to quickly see which of the most common errors are being made. There are no trick questions, and the phrases &quot;all of the above&quot; and &quot;none of the above&quot; are never used, since they do not give useful information about the methods a student used.</p>
