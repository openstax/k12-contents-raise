<h3>Activity: Modeling Rocket Flight Using a Quadratic Equation (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>In lesson 8.11, students learned how to find the specific equation in standard form of a quadratic function that has certain zeros and passes through a particular point. In this activity, students will put those skills to use to find a specific equation that models the path of a rocket given the parameters of the problem. They will then use this equation to make a prediction about its flight.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students into groups of two. Allow students time to discuss the problem as a pair. Pause for a whole-class discussion after the first question. Then allow students to continue on to the second question.</p>

<h4>Student-Facing Statement </h4>
<p>Alejandra lights the fuse on a small toy rocket. The fuse burns down and, after 1 second, the rocket launches into the air. The rocket lands back on the ground after 6 seconds.</p>
<p>After 5 seconds from when Alejandra lit the fuse, the height of the rocket was 8 meters.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>What is the quadratic equation in standard form that models the flight of the rocket? (Hint: Think of the problem as a quadratic function in which you know the zeros and a point through which the function passes.)</li>
  <li>Use the equation you found in the previous question to find the height of the rocket, in meters, 3 seconds after Alejandra lit the fuse.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Since the rocket left the ground at 1 second after Alejandra lit the fuse and it landed again 6 seconds after, we know the zeros of the quadratic equation are 1 and 6.</li>
</ol>
<p>This means the factored form of the quadratic equation modeling the flight of the rocket is \(f(x) =(x-1)(x-6)\).</p>
<p>We also know that at 5 seconds after Alejandra lit the fuse, the rocket was at a height of 8 meters. This means the quadratic equation we are looking for passes through the point \((5, 8)\).</p>
<p>We can use the intercept form of the quadratic equation to find the standard form we want.</p>
<p>We know the intercept form of a quadratic equation is \(f(x) = a(x &minus; p)(x &minus; q)\).</p>
<p>To find the value of \(a\), we can substitute the zeros for \(p\) and \(q\). We can also substitute 5 for \(x\) and 8 for \(f(x)\).</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}f(x)\;&amp;=&amp;\;a(x\;-\;p)(x\;-\;q)\\f(x)\;&amp;=&amp;\;a(x\;-\;1)(x\;-\;6)\\8&amp;=&amp;\;a((5)\;-\;1)((5)\;-\;6)\\8&amp;=&amp;\;a(4)(-1)\\8&amp;=&amp;\;-4a\\-2&amp;=&amp;\;a\\&amp;&amp;\end{array}\)</p>
<p>We can now substitute -2 back into the equation in intercept form for \(a\). Again, we can substitute the zeros for \(p\) and \(q\).</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}f(x)\;&amp;=&amp;\;a(x\;-\;p)(x\;-\;q)\\f(x)\;&amp;=&amp;\;-2(x\;-\;1)(x\;-\;6)\\f(x)\;&amp;=&amp;\;-2(x^2-7x+6)\\f(x)\;&amp;=&amp;\;-2x^2+14x-12\\&amp;&amp;\end{array}\)</p>
<p>So, the quadratic equation in standard form that models the flight of the rocket is \(f(x) = -2x^2+14x-12\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>To find the height of the rocket 3 seconds after Alejandra lit the fuse, we substitute 3 for \(x\) in the equation we just found.</li>
</ol>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}f(x)&amp;=&amp;-2x^2+14x-12\\f(x)&amp;=&amp;-2(3)^2+14(3)-12\\f(x)\;&amp;=&amp;\;-2(9)+42-12\\f(x)\;&amp;=&amp;\;-18+42-12\\f(x)\;&amp;=&amp;\;12\end{array}\)</p>
<p>The rocket was at 12 meters exactly 3 seconds after Alejandra lit the fuse.</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students might look at the zeros of the function and think that the equation they are looking for is the standard form equivalent of the function \(f(x) =(x-1)(x-6)\), or \(f(x) =x^2-7x+6\). This function does not pass through the point \((5, 8)\). Remind students that though this function is related to the function we want, since it shares the same zeros, it is not the specific function we want. If students graph the function \(f(x) =x^2-7x+6\), they will see it does not model a possible flight path of a rocket.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Show students the graph of the function from the activity <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/aac3a1bb0907fb1345e0f701874908346477d68d" target="_blank">using Desmos here</a>.</p>
<p>Ask students:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> Summarize, in your own words, how you found the equation in standard form that models the flight of the rocket. (Sample answer: I analyzed the problem to find the zeros of the function. I used the zeros of the function and the point through which the function passes to find the value of \(a\) in the intercept form of the function. I substituted the value of \(a\) and the zeros into the intercept form of the function. I simplified the equation to find the standard form of the function.) </li>
  <li> Is it possible to model the flight of a rocket that has the same zeros but reaches a different maximum height as the rocket in this activity? Explain. (Yes. The equation modeling the flight of that rocket would be related to the equation we found, since they would have the same zeros. It would, however, have different coefficients in standard form, since it passes through a different point.) </li>
</ul>
