<p>Wind farms and solar power produce clean energy and are methods of reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. The energy produced can be stored in batteries. Mr. Das is studying methods of producing stronger batteries with longer life. He can use functions to study the energy inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>In this section, you will learn that a sequence is a type of function in which the input variable is the position (always an integer), and the output variable is the term in that position. You will learn how to write sequences using function notation and how to find the value of the nth term.</p>
<p>This section includes 5 lessons:</p>
