<p>In this lesson, we looked at how the parts of a function representing exponential change are expressed on the graph.</p>
<p>Display for all to see:</p>
<p>\(f(x)=a \cdot b^x\)</p>
<p>Also display a blank set of coordinate axes focused on the first quadrant.</p>
<ul>
<li> Ask three students to propose different positive numbers. </li>
<li> If \(b\)&nbsp;is 2, how would these three different numbers in place of \(a\) affect a graph representing this function? Sketch graphs. Attend to how you would decide on a graphing window. </li>
<li> If \(b\) is \(\frac12\), what would the three graphs look like now? Sketch them. </li>
</ul>
<p>If time permits, set a fixed value for \(a\), ask students to suggest three different positive numbers to use in place of \(b\)<em>, </em>and repeat.</p>
