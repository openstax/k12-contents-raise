<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Determine a reasonable domain and range for the function when given a description of a function in a situation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li> 4.12.1: Different Features of a Graph </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you compared features of 4 different graphs to determine which did not belong. </li>
</ul>
<li> 4.12.2: Graphs of Functions </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you matched graphs to situations they could represent. You then determined the domain and range when you were given more information about the graphs. </li>
</ul>
<li> 4.12.2: Self Check </li>
<li> 4.12.3: Finding Domain and Range Using a Graph </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you used a graph to determine the domain and range using maximum and minimum values. You also determined the value of the \(x\)- and \(y\)-intercepts. </li>
</ul>
<li> 4.12.3: Self Check </li>
<li> 4.12.4: Real-World Domain and Range </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you looked at graphs representing real-world situations that were both discrete and continuous functions. You then determined the domain and range of each type of function. For continuous functions, you wrote the domain and range as inequalities. </li>
</ul>
<li> 4.12.4: Self Check </li>
<li> 4.12.5: Graph of a Function and the Domain and Range Connection </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you examined a graph and determined if a value was in the range. You then identified the range and also determined if there is a solution to the graph. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li> 4.12.6: Practice </li>
