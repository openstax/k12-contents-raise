<p>To synthesize the work in this lesson and connect it to prior work, discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>"How would you solve the equation \(x(x&minus;250)=0\)?" (The simplest way would be to use the zero product property, which tells us that one of the factors must be 0, so \(x=0\) and \(x=250\).) </li>
<li>"If you choose to solve by graphing, is it necessary to rearrange and rewrite the equation first? What equation would you graph, and how would you use the graph to solve the equation?" (No. We can just graph \(y = x(x&minus;250)\) and look for the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph.) </li>
<li>"Can we use the zero product property to solve \(x(x&minus;250)=100\)? Why or why not?" (No, because the expression on the left does not equal 0.) </li>
<li>"How would you solve \(x(x&minus;250)=100\)?" (We can rewrite the equation as \(x(x&minus;250)&minus;100=0\), graph \(y = x(x&minus;250)&minus;100\), and see what the \(x\)-intercepts are.) </li>
<li>"How can the graph tell us how many solutions there are?" (The number of \(x\)-intercepts reveals the number of solutions.) </li>
</ul>
<p>Remind students that examining a graph is not a reliable way to get exact solutions to an equation. For example, the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph for \(y = x(x&minus;250)&minus;100\) are \((-0.399, 0)\) and \((250.399, 0)\), and those \(x\)-coordinates are likely rounded results.</p>
<p>To solve equations exactly, we need to use algebraic means. In upcoming lessons, we'll learn more strategies for doing so.</p>
