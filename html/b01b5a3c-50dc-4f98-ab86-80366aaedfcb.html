<p>Compare your answer: Your answer may vary, but here are some samples.</p>
<ul>
<li>A doesn't belong because: It is the only graph that has no maximum or minimum. It is the only situation in which the temperature does not change.</li>
<li>B doesn't belong because: It is the only graph that has one maximum. It is the only graph that shows the temperature rising and then falling (but not rising again).</li>
<li>C doesn't belong because: It is the only graph that has horizontal intercepts. It is the only graph that has one minimum. It is the only graph that shows negative output values or negative temperatures. It is the only graph that shows temperature falling and then rising (but not falling again).</li>
<li>D doesn't belong because: It is the only graph that has several maxima and minima. It is the only graph where the temperature rises and falls several times. This graph shows a repeating pattern.</li>
