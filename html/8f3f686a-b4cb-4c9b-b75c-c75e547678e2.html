<ol>
<li>Based on this model, which price would generate more revenue for the company, \($5\) or \($17\)?</li>
<br>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \($5\), as it would generate about \($3,700\) in revenue. Charging \($17\) would bring in about \($2,500\).</p>

<li>What is an appropriate domain for the function? Explain how you know.</li>
<br>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(0 \leq p \leq 20\), because the price has to be non-negative, and the company would earn negative revenue if the price were more than \($20\).</p>
