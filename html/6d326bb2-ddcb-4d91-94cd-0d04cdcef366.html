<p>Help students reflect on the key ideas of the lesson by discussing, as a class or with a partner, questions such as the following:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li>&ldquo;What are some limitations of solving \(-2x^2 &minus; 2x + 40 = 10\) by guessing and checking? What about by graphing?&rdquo; (Sample answer: If the solution is not an integer, then it will be difficult to find the solution. Graphing will also not produce an exact solution, only an estimate.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Which equation do you think is easier to solve: \(-2x^2 &minus; 2x + 40 = 0\) or \((8 &minus; 2x)(x + 5) = 0\)? Why?&rdquo; (Sample answer: The equation in factored form is easier to solve since the equation is set equal to 0. The zeros, or solutions, are easier to identify.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Which appears easier to solve: \((8 &minus; 2x)(x + 5) = 10\) or \(-2x^2 &minus; 2x + 40 = 10\)? Why?&rdquo; (Sample answer: They are both difficult to solve. The factors in the factored form are not equal to zero on their own. The equation \(-2x^2 &minus; 2x + 40 = 10\) is one step closer to solving mathematically, if we can figure out a way to factor it.)</li>
