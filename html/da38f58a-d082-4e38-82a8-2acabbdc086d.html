<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<br>
<p>This lesson continues to explore operations with polynomials as students master polynomial multiplication. Students start by multiplying with monomials. This involves a review of the properties of exponents and the Distributive Property. Multiple methods are then introduced to practice multiplying two binomials.</p>
<p>The previously introduced Vertical Alignment and distribution will be used to multiply polynomials by other polynomials. As students learn these methods better, they will weigh their advantages and disadvantages. They will learn to recognize special situations in which patterns can be learned and implemented to efficiently multiply these binomials together. Finally, students will use their previous knowledge of polynomial functions to further practice the multiplication they have learned in this lesson.</p>
<h4> Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Multiply monomials together using multiplication properties of exponents. </li>
  <li> Multiply polynomials together using the Distributive Property, Vertical Alignment, and the FOIL method (for binomials). </li>
  <li> Recognize special case products such as binomial squares and conjugate pairs and use designated rules to facilitate their multiplication. </li>
  <li> Multiply polynomials expressed in function form. </li>
</ul>
<h4> Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>

<h4> Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<div>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS.  The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.<br>&nbsp;<br>
	<ul>
		<li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
		<li>ELPS 3(H) narrate, describe, and explain with increasing specificity and detail as more English is acquired</li>
		<li>ELPS 5(B) write using newly acquired basic vocabulary and content-based grade-level vocabulary</li>
