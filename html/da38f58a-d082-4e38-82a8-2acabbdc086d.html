<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<br>
<p>This lesson continues to explore operations with polynomials as students master polynomial multiplication. Students start by multiplying with monomials. This involves a review of the properties of exponents and the Distributive Property. Multiple methods are then introduced to practice multiplying two binomials.</p>
<p>The previously introduced Vertical Alignment and distribution will be used to multiply polynomials by other polynomials. As students learn these methods better, they will weigh their advantages and disadvantages. They will learn to recognize special situations in which patterns can be learned and implemented to efficiently multiply these binomials together. Finally, students will use their previous knowledge of polynomial functions to further practice the multiplication they have learned in this lesson.</p>
