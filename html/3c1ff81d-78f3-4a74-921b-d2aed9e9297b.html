<h4>Cool Down Activity</h4>
<p>The college student who is looking for a data plan for her cell phone found a third option, which also offers a 2-gigabyte monthly allowance for data.</p>
<p>The monthly cost of this option can be represented by function \(C\), defined by \(C(x)=30x+5\), where \(x\) is the gigabytes of data used over the monthly allowance.</p>

    <p>\(C(0.7)=26\) because \(30(0.7)+5=26\). Your answers
      may vary, but here is a possible explanation: It means that the cost would be $26 if she used 0.7 gigabyte over the 2-gigabytes allowance in a month.

      <li>Her budget is still $50 a month. To find out how many gigabytes of data she could use if she chose this plan, she writes \(C(x)=50\)&nbsp;and solves for \(x\). What value of \(x\) makes this equation true? Show your reasoning.</li>

    <p>\(x=1.5\). Your answers may vary, but here is a possible explanation: Because \(C(x)=30x+5\), we can write \(C(x)=50\) as \(30x+5=50\) and solve for \(x\), which gives 1.5.</p>
