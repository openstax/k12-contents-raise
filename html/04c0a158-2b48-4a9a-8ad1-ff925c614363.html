<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>This lesson introduces students to function notation. Students encounter situations in which referencing certain functions and their input-output pairs gets complicated, wordy, or unclear. This motivates a way to talk about functions that is more concise and precise.</p>
<p>Students learn that function notation is a succinct way to name a function and to specify its input and output. They interpret function notation in terms of the quantities in a situation and use function notation to represent simple statements about a function. The work in this lesson prompts students to reason quantitatively and abstractly and communicate precisely.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Interpret statements that use function notation and explain (orally and in writing) their meaning in terms of a situation.</li>
  <li>Understand that function notation is a succinct way to name a function and specify its input and output.</li>
  <li>Use function notation to express functions with specific inputs and outputs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Use function notation to express functions that have specific inputs and outputs.</li>
  <li>Explain what function notation is and why it exists.</li>
  <li>Explain a statement written in function notation in terms of a situation.</li>
</ul>
