<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>This lesson introduces students to function notation. Students encounter situations in which referencing certain functions and their input-output pairs gets complicated, wordy, or unclear. This motivates a way to talk about functions that is more concise and precise.</p>
<p>Students learn that function notation is a succinct way to name a function and to specify its input and output. They interpret function notation in terms of the quantities in a situation and use function notation to represent simple statements about a function. The work in this lesson prompts students to reason quantitatively and abstractly and communicate precisely.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Interpret statements that use function notation and explain (orally and in writing) their meaning in terms of a situation.</li>
  <li>Understand that function notation is a succinct way to name a function and specify its input and output.</li>
  <li>Use function notation to express functions with specific inputs and outputs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Use function notation to express functions that have specific inputs and outputs.</li>
  <li>Explain what function notation is and why it exists.</li>
  <li>Explain a statement written in function notation in terms of a situation.</li>
</ul>

<h4 >Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
  A3(G) express opinions, ideas, and feelings ranging from communicating single words and short phrases to participating in extended discussions on a variety of social and grade-appropriate academic topics
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
   A4(F) use visual and contextual support and support from peers and teachers to read grade-appropriate content area text, enhance and confirm understanding, and develop vocabulary, grasp of language structures, and background knowledge needed to comprehend increasingly challenging language
  </li>
</ul>
