<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>In case students are unfamiliar with antibiotics, explain that they kill bacteria and keep bacteria from reproducing.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>The graph shows the bacteria population on a petri dish as a function \(f\)<em>&nbsp;</em>of the days \(d\)&nbsp;since an antibiotic is introduced.</p>

<ol>
<li> What is the approximate value of \(f(4.5)\)? <br>
<br>
<strong>Answer: </strong>The exact value is 622,431, but reasonable approximations should be greater than 600,000 and less than 650,000. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li> Approximately what is \(d\)&nbsp;when \(f(d)=400,000\)? <br>
<br>
<strong>Answer: </strong>The value to one decimal place is 8.7, but reasonable approximations should be greater than 8.5 and less than 9. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li> Explain what you would do, using your usual graphing technology, to be able to see \(f(15)\) on the graph. <br>
<br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> Answers vary based on what graphing technology is used.
  </li>

<h4> Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<p>Points to emphasize:</p>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to interpret graphs, so use the results from this cool-down to choose points to emphasize in subsequent lessons and highlight and reinforce strategies for identifying points on graphs.</p>
