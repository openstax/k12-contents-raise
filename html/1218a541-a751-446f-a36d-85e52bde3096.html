<h4></h4>
<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>Students will use knowledge of point-slope form to find the equation of lines given a point and a slope. They will then write each equation in slope-intercept form and explore equations with the same slopes and different \(y\)-intercepts. Being exposed to examples and non-examples will help lead them to the concept of parallel lines that have the same slope.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Allow students to work in pairs to go through each step of the activity. Each student should receive a paper of coordinate grids. Colored pencils and a straight-edge are recommended. When graphing, it is suggested that students graph each line in a different color and label the line with the equation. At the end of the activity, have pairs share their results of each step to the class and what they noticed along the way.</p>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement<br></h4>
<p>1. For each of the following slopes and points, find the equation of the line using point-slope form.</p>
<p>a. \( m = 2, (3, 1) \)<br>b. \(&nbsp;m = 2, (-1, 4)&nbsp;\)<br>c. \(&nbsp;m = -4, (2, 1)&nbsp;\)<br>d. \(&nbsp;m = -4, (3, -2)&nbsp;\)</p>
<p>2. Write each of the four equations from the previous question in slope-intercept form.<br></p>
<p>3. Now, graph the equations \( a \) and \( b \) on one graph and \( c \) and \( d \) on another graph.<br></p>
<p>4. What is the same in the equations?<br></p>
<p>5.&nbsp; What do you notice about the graphs?<br></p>

<h4>Find the Line Parallel to a Given Line</h4>
<p>In this section, you will use what you know about writing the equation of a line given the slope and a point to write the equation of parallel lines. The graph shows the equation of the line&nbsp;\( y = 2x - 3. \) The point&nbsp;\( P \)&nbsp;\( (-2, 1) \) is also plotted. You can use the fact that parallel lines have the same slope to find a line that is parallel to line \(m\) and goes through point \( P \) \( (-2, 1) \).&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="This figure has a graph of a straight line and a point on the x y-coordinate plane. The x and y-axes run from negative 8 to 8. The line goes through the points (0, negative 3), (1, negative 1), and (2, 1). The point (negative 2, 1) is plotted. The line does not go through the point (negative 2, 1)." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="324" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/7c5e9aa9d7cccfbead0c314eb26b2bd0ab0f22ef" width="317"><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>From the equation, you know the slope of the line is 2. The second line will pass through \(&nbsp;(-2, 1)&nbsp;\) and have slope 2. To graph the line, start at \(&nbsp;(-2, 1)&nbsp;\) and count out the rise and run. The slope is \( \frac{rise}{run}=\frac{2}{1} \). Count out the rise, 2, and run, 1, and plot the point. You can graph the line as shown. Line \(&nbsp;m&nbsp;\) is parallel to line \(&nbsp;l&nbsp;\) and goes through point \(&nbsp;P \) \( (-2, 1)&nbsp;\).</span></p>

<p>To find the equation of a line parallel to a line through a given point algebraically, you can use what you know about finding the equation of a line given the slope and a point.</p>

<p>Write an equation of a line parallel to&nbsp;\( y = 2x - 3 \) that contains the point \( (-2, 1) \). Write the equation in slope-intercept form.</p>
