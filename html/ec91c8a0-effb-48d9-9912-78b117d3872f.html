<h3>Activity</h3>
<p>In the previous activity, students matched the line of best fit best modeled a scatter plot of data. Now, given data in a table or graph, students will find a linear model that represents the data without technology. They will use the data to find the slope and \(y\)-intercept of an equation.</p>
<p>The discussion in the synthesis will prepare them for future activities when they use technology to find the line of best fit with technology and need to interpret the meaning of the slope and \(y\)-intercept for given scenarios.<br>
</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in pairs and briefly review slope-intercept form and the meaning of the variables in the form.</p>
<br>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>

<p>Linear models can also be found by hand in some situations when the data follows a linear pattern since the slope remains the same between data points.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Write an equation in slope-intercept form to represent the situation then predict the number of texts sent in 8 days.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Find the \(y\)-intercept.<br>
Since the value when \(d=0\) is not present, work backwards to \(d=0\).&nbsp;<br>
If \(d=0\) was present, then \(T=0\) since as each x-value increases by 1, the \(y\)-values increase by 65.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Find the slope of the situation.<br>
Find the rate of change. The change in y is 65 and the change in \(x\) is 1, so the slope is 65</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> -Write the equation in slope-intercept form.<br>
\(y=mx+b\)<br>
\(T=65d +0\)<br>
\(T=65d\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 </strong>-Make a prediction.<br>
Substitute \(d=8\) into the equation.<br>
\(T=65(8)=520\)</p>

<p>After 8 days, the teen would have sent 520 texts.</p>

<p>The cost, C, for the number of days, \(d\), a dog spends at doggie daycare is shown in the graph below.<br>

<p>Write an equation in slope-intercept form to represent the situation then predict the cost of a dog staying at doggie daycare after 7 days.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 </strong>- Find the \(y\)-intercept.<br>
Since the value when \(d=0\) is not present, work backwards to \(d=0\).&nbsp;<br>
If \(d=0\) was present, then \(C=0\) since as each \(x\)-value increases by 1, the \(y\)-values increase by 35.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 </strong>- Find the slope of the situation.<br>
Find the rate of change. The change in \(y\) is 35 and the change in \(x\) is 1, so the slope is 35</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> -Write the equation in slope-intercept form.<br>
\(y=mx+b\)<br>
\(C=35d +0\)<br>
\(C=35d\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> -Make a prediction.<br>
Substitute \(d=7\) into the equation.<br>
\(C=35(7)=245\)</p>
<br>
<p>After 7 days, the cost of doggie daycare would be $245.</p>

<br>
<p>How many square feet can Naomi paint in 8 hours?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 960</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Find the \(y\)-intercept.<br>
Since the value when \(h=0\) is not present, work backwards to \(h=0\).&nbsp;<br>
If \(h=0\) was present, then \(F=0\) since as each \(x\)-value increases by 1, the y-values increase by 120.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Find the slope of the situation.<br>
Find the rate of change. The change in \(y\) is 120 and the change in \(x\) is 1, so the slope is 120</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> -Write the equation in slope-intercept form.<br>
\(y=mx+b\)<br>
\(F=120h+0\)<br>
\(F=120h\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> -Make a prediction.<br>
Substitute \(h=8\) into the equation.<br>
\(F=120(8)=960\)</p>
<p>Naomi can paint 960 square feet in 8 hours.</p>
