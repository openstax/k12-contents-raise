      <p><span>To help students sum up the key ideas of the lesson, display dynamic graphs of the two equations from the &ldquo;Writing, Graphing, and Solving a Linear Equation&rdquo; activity. Also, display these questions for all to see:</span></p>

      <ul>
        <li>In the first situation, will the student have&nbsp;<span>$</span>5,000 after saving for 20 weeks?</li>
        <li>In the second situation, after how many minutes should we stop the draining if we want to leave 150 gallons of water in the tank?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Discuss with students:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>&ldquo;How can we use the graph of&nbsp;<span>\( y=475+125x \)</span>&nbsp;to answer the first question?&rdquo; (See if the point&nbsp;<span>\( (20, 5000) \)</span>&nbsp;is on or below the graph. It is not, so the answer is no.)</li>
        <li>&ldquo;How can we use the graph of&nbsp;<span>\( y=450-20x \)</span>&nbsp;to answer the second question?&rdquo; (Find the point on the graph where the&nbsp;<span>\( y \)</span>-value is 150, and see what the&nbsp;<span>\( x \)</span>-value is.)</li>
        <li>&ldquo;On the graph for the first situation, what does the point&nbsp;<span>\( (15, 3000) \)</span>&nbsp;mean?&rdquo; (After 15 weeks, there is&nbsp;<span>$</span>3,000 in the bank account.)</li>
        <li>&ldquo;Is that ordered pair a solution to the equation&nbsp;<span>\( y=475+125x \)</span>? How can we tell?&rdquo; (No. The point&nbsp;<span>\( (15, 3000) \)</span>&nbsp;is above the graph, not on the graph. After 15 weeks, there is less than&nbsp;<span>$</span>3,000 in the account.)</li>
        <li>&ldquo;Is&nbsp;<span>\( (25, -50) \)</span>&nbsp;a solution to the equation&nbsp;<span>\( y=450-20x \)</span>? Why or why not?&rdquo; (No. The point is not on the graph. A negative&nbsp;<span>\( y \)</span>-value also has no meaning in this situation. The point&nbsp;<span>\( (25, -50) \)</span>&nbsp;means that after 25 minutes, there are &minus;50 gallons of water in the tank, which doesn&rsquo;t make sense.)</li>
        <li>&ldquo;In general, how can a graph helps us find solutions to two-variable equations?&rdquo; (Any point on the graph of the equation is a solution to that equation.)</li>
