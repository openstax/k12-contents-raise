<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Explain why multiplying binomials that are a sum and a difference, \((x + m)(x &minus; m)\), results in a quadratic expression with no linear term. </li>
  <li> Rewrite a quadratic expression of the form \(x^2&minus; c\) into its factored form. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> 8.8.1: Evaluating Expressions Using Mental Math </li>
  <ul class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li> In this activity, you learned shortcuts to performing mental math that provided insight into strategies for factoring quadratic expressions. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 8.8.2: Recognizing the Expanded Product of the Difference of Two Squares </li>
  <ul class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li> In this activity, you learned to reverse the process using the difference of squares to find the factored form of particular quadratic expressions. </li>
    <li> 8.8.2: Self Check </li>
    <li> 8.8.2: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 8.8.3: Factoring Quadratic Equations Without a Linear Term </li>
  <ul class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li> In this activity, you continued to practice finding the factored form of quadratic expressions using the difference of squares. You also learned that some binomials of the form \(x^2+c\) do not have a factored form. </li>
    <li> 8.8.3: Self Check </li>
    <li> 8.8.3: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 8.8.4: Determining if an Expression Can Be Rewritten in Factored Form </li>
  <ul class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li> In this activity, you determined whether a quadratic expression was factorable before finding its factored form using the skills learned in this lesson. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> 8.8.5: Practice </li>
