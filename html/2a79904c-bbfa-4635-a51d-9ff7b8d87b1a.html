<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students continue to interpret a graph of a function in terms of a situation and relate the features of the graph to the domain and range of the function. The context is a familiar one, allowing students to focus their reasoning on domain and range.</p>
<p>Unlike in the activity about a child on a swing, the graph includes a scale on each axis and the coordinate pairs of some points, allowing students to identify the range more definitively. However, the graph is a partial representation of the function because it does not show what happens after a dropped ball hits the ground the fifth time. When describing the domain, students need to attend to what is reasonable in this situation (that is, noting that the ball likely does not just stop after the fifth bounce).</p>
<h4>Student Activity </h4>
<p>A tennis ball was dropped from a certain height. It bounced several times, rolled along for a short period, and then stopped. Function \(H\) gives its height over time.</p>
<p>Here is a partial graph of \(H\). Height is measured in feet. Time is measured in seconds.</p>
<p>Use the graph to help you answer the questions.</p>
<p>Be prepared to explain what each value or set of values means in this situation.</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Find \(H(0)\). What point is this on the graph? What does it represent?</li>
  <p> <strong>Answer: </strong> \(H(0)=6\). It tells us the ball was dropped from a height of 6 feet at \(t=0\). </p>
  <li> Solve \(H(x)=0\). </li>
  <p> <strong>Answer: </strong> \(x=0.54\), \(x=1.48\), and \(x=2.25\) are three possible solutions, but there are others. Each one represents the time when the ball hit the ground. </p>
  <li> Describe the domain of the function. </li>
    <p> <strong>Answer: </strong> For example: The domain includes all values between 0 and the time when the ball stopped moving, which, based on the graph, is about 3.8. </p>
  <li> Describe the range of the function. </li>
  <p> <strong>Answer: </strong> For example: The range includes all values between 0 and 6 feet, the height from which the ball was dropped. </p>

<p>In function \(H\), the input was time in seconds, and the output was height in feet.</p>

  <li> Describe a function whose domain includes only integers. Be sure to specify the units. </li>
      <p> <strong>Answer: </strong> The maximum height, in feet, that the ball reaches after \(n\) bounces as a function of the number of bounces. </p>
  <li>Sketch a graph of this function. </li>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Focus the discussion on how students reasoned about the domain and the range for the function. Highlight explanations that account for what is realistic in the context.</p>
<ul>
  <li> The domain tells us all the possible amounts of time that passed since the moment the tennis ball was dropped until it stopped rolling. </li>
  <li> The range includes all the possible heights of the tennis ball from the time it was dropped until the time it stopped rolling. </li>
</ul>
<p>Ask students if there are points on the graph whose coordinates are particularly useful for identifying the domain and range of the function. (The heights of the bounces? The points where the ball hits the ground? Points between the two? Others?)</p>
<p>Emphasize that, just like in the activity about the swing, some points and features on a graph can give us more information than others about possible input-output values of a function.</p>

<h3>4.13.3: Self Check&nbsp;</h3>

      <td>
        <p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: The input is 14, so it is the \(x\)-value. The answer is \(C(14)=0\) and is when the restaurant closes and has no more customers around 10 p.m.</p>

      <td>
        <p>That&rsquo;s correct! Check yourself: Since 14 is the input value, look for where 14 is located on the \(x\)-axis. The output there is 0, which means that there are no customers 14 hours after 8 a.m., which is about 10 p.m.</p>

        <p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: The input and output values and their meanings should be switched. The answer is \(C(14)=0\) and is when the restaurant closes and has no more customers around 10 p.m.</p>

        <p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: The output gives the number of customers at that time, not over a period of time. The answer is \(C(14)=0\) and is when the restaurant closes and has no more customers around 10 p.m.</p>

<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to find the domain and range of the graph:</p>
<p>The domain includes the \(x\)-values or inputs of the graph. The domain is from at least 0 to at most 10.</p>
<p>The range includes the \(y\)-values or outputs of the graph. The range is from at least 1 to at most 3.</p>
