<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity prompts students to write equations and has them make connections between the different forms of equations. Students will write linear equations in slope-intercept form, standard form, and point-slope form and work to change from one form to the other.</p>
<p>As students work, facilitate discussion about when each form would be helpful to use. Also, make sure that students are entering values in the correct places in the form. When transferring from one form to another, students may need reminders about the use of inverse operations.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Ask students if they have ever seen any of the forms before. If so, what do they remember? They should be able to at least say what \(m\) stands for, after activity 4.7.2. Place students in pairs to work through the activity. Independent students can go through the activity, but some students may need help working through substituting into the formulas throughout the activity.</p>
<h4>Student Activity </h4>
<p>In Algebra, equations are commonly written in three different ways: slope-intercept form, point-slope form, and standard form. They are equivalent ways to write the same equation, but each one is useful for different reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(2x - y = -3\)</p>
<p>Write the equation in the form \(Ax + By = C\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 </strong>- Rearrange terms so the \(x\) term and the \(y\) term are both on the left side of the equation.</p>
<p>Subtract \(2x\) from both sides:</p>
<p>\(y - 2x = 2x - 2x + 3\)</p>

      <p>Use this routine to prepare students for the whole-class discussion by providing them with multiple opportunities to clarify their explanations through conversation. Before the whole-class discussion begins, give students time to meet with 1-2 other groups to share their steps for rewriting equations from one form to the other.  Invite listeners to press for accurate mathematical language to help speakers move away from informal language such as plus, minus, take away, times, etc. Encourage the use of more formal language such as add, subtract, multiply, etc.<br>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>If students have trouble with where to substitute values into the formulas, it can be helpful to have them highlight variables and the matching value, or use colored pencils to color code the value that will substitute into the formula. For example, in \(y = mx + b\), if \(m = 3\) and the \(y\)-intercept is -2, highlight the \(m\) and the 3 in pink in the formula and the given value, then highlight the \(b\) and the \(y\)-intercept value in yellow.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite pairs to show how they got each answer. Ask if they followed the same order of steps as the feedback or if a different set of steps work.</p>
<p>Ask students:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Which form do you find the easiest to work with? The hardest? </li>
  <li> What do you need to watch out for in each formula? </li>
</ul>
<p>Sample answer might include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Slope-intercept form: be careful to substitute the slope and \(y\)-intercept in the correct places </li>
  <li> Point-slope form: be sure to substitute the point into \((x_1,y_1)\), not \((x,y)\). </li>
  <li> Standard form: make sure to get rid of decimals and fractions, and write the \(x\) term first. Be sure not to lead with a negative number in the front. </li>
</ul>
<p>If time allows, have students create their own equations in one form and ask a partner to write it in a different form.</p>

<h4>Writing Linear Equations in Different Forms</h4>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Find the equation of a line with slope −9 and \(y\)-intercept \((0,−4)\) in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 </strong>- Identify the \(m\) and \(b\).</p>
<p>\(m = -9\), \(b = -4\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Substitute into the formula.</p>
<p>\(y = -9x - 4\)</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Find the equation of a line in point-slope form given a slope of \(-\frac13\) and the point \((6,-4)\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Identify the \(m\) and \((x_1,y_1)\).</p>
<p>\(m = -\frac{1}{3} x_1=6 y_1= -4\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Substitute into the formula.</p>
<p>\(y-(-4)=-\frac{1}{3}(x-6)\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Simplify</p>
<p>\(y+4=-\frac{1}{3}(x-6)\)</p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>
<p>Write the equation \(y+4=-\frac{1}{3}(x-6)\) in standard form.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Multiply to get rid of the fraction.<br>
  Remember, standard form cannot have decimals or fractions.<br>
  Multiply every term by 3.</p>
<p>\(3(y+4)=3(-\frac{1}{3}(x-6))\)</p>
<p>\(3y+12=-(x-6)\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Distribute.</p>
<p>\(3y+12=-x+6\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Rearrange terms so the \(x\) term and the \(y\) term are both on the left side of the equation.<br>
  Add \(x\) to both sides.</p>
<p>\(3y+12+x=-x+x+6\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Simplify.</p>
<p>\(3y+12+x=6\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> - Bring the constants to the right side.<br>
  Subtract 12 from both sides.</p>
<p>\(3y+12+x-12=6-12\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 6 </strong>- Simplify.</p>
<p>\(3y+x=-6\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong> - Write the \(x\) term before the \(y\) term.</p>
<p>\(3x+y=-6\)</p>

<h4>Try It: Writing Linear Equations in Different Forms</h4>
<p>Write the equation \(y-3=2(x+5)\) in standard form.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(2x-y=-13\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Distribute.</p>
<p>\(y-3=2x+10\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Rearrange terms so the \(x\) term and the \(y\) term are both on the left side of the equation.</p>
<p>Subtract \(2x\) from both sides.</p>
<p>\(y-3-2x=2x-2x+10\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Simplify.</p>
<p>\(y-3-2x=10\)</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Bring the constants to the right side.</p>
<p>Add 3 to both sides.</p>
<p>\(y-3-2x+3=10+3\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> - Simplify.</p>
<p>\(y-2x=13\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong> - Write the \(x\) term before the \(y\) term.</p>
<p>\(-2x+y=13\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong>- Multiply each term by -1.</p>
<p>Standard form cannot lead with a negative.</p>
<p>\(-1(-2x+y=13)\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong> - Simplify.</p>
<p>\(2x-y=-13\)</p>
