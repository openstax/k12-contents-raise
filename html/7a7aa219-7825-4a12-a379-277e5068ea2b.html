<p>In this lesson, you start to view situations characterized by exponential change using descriptions, tables, and graphs as exponential functions. This means choosing an independent and dependent variable and expressing the relationships using function language and, in some cases, function notation. You use variables to represent one real-world quantity as a function of another, which is an example of decontextualizing and reasoning abstractly.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Use function notation to write equations that represent exponential relationships. </li>
  <li> Determine whether the relationships in descriptions, tables, equations, or graphs are functions. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 5.8.1: Meaning of a Function Presented Graphically </li>
  <li> 5.8.2: Represent a Function as a Table of Values, Graph, and Equation <ul>
