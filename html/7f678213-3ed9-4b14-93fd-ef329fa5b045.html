<p>In this lesson, you will continue to develop your ability to interpret statements in function notation in terms of a situation, including reasoning about inequalities.
</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the connections between a statement in function notation and the graph of the function.</li>
<li>Use function notation to efficiently represent a relationship between two quantities in a situation.</li>
<li>Use statements in function notation to sketch a graph of a function.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the<strong> activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>4.3.1: Comparing Function Values</li>
<li>4.3.2: Writing Statements from Function Notation</li>
<li>4.3.2: Self Check</li>
<li>4.3.3: Comparing Statements in Function Notation</li>
<li>4.3.3: Self Check</li>
<li>4.3.4: Using Function Notation with a Real-World Example</li>
