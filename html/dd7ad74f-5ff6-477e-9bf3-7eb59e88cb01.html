<h3>Activity (10 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students are given a set of equations and graphs of quadratic functions and are asked to match them. To do so, students apply their understanding about the connections between the two representations. To make the matches, they rely on the structure of a quadratic expression and how it relates to the graph, so technology is not an appropriate tool here.</p>
<p>As students work, encourage them to refine their descriptions of the equations and graphs using more precise language and mathematical terms. They also practice explaining their reasoning and critiquing the reasoning of others as they take turns matching and supporting their matches.</p>
<p>As students discuss, listen for strategies they use to match the representations. Highlight productive and reliable strategies as well as use of precise language in the discussion.</p>
<p>Here are the equations and graphs for reference and planning:</p>
<p>\(f(x)=(x&minus;1)^2+4\)</p>
<p>\(g(x)=-(x&minus;4)^2+1\)</p>
<p>\(h(x)=(x+1)^2&minus;4\)</p>
<p>\(p(x)=-(x+1)^2&minus;4\)</p>
<p>\(q(x)=2(x&minus;4)^2+1\)</p>
<p>\(r(x)=(x+4)^2&minus;1\)</p>

<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Give each group a set of cut-up cards. Ask students to take turns matching a card containing an equation with a graph that represents it. The first partner identifies a match and explains why they think it is a match, while the other listens and works to understand. Then, they switch roles. If they disagree, they should discuss their thinking and work to reach an agreement. Ask students to record each match (write the equation and sketch the graph) and their reasoning. If time is limited, students may just record the label of the graph instead of sketching.</p>
<p>Because this activity is designed to be completed without technology, ask students to put away any devices.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Your teacher will give you a set of cards. Each card contains an equation or a graph that represents a quadratic function. Take turns matching each equation to a graph that represents the same function.</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> For each pair of cards that you match, explain to your partner how you know they belong together. </li>
<li> For each pair of cards that your partner matches, listen carefully to their explanation. If you disagree, discuss your thinking and work to reach an agreement. </li>
<li> Once all the cards are matched, record the equation, the letter of the equation, and a sketch of the corresponding graph, and write a brief note or explanation about how you knew they were a match. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may be challenged to identify the coordinates of the vertex on the graphs because the \(x\)- and \(y\)-axes use a different scale. Encourage students to write down coordinates of the vertex and the intercepts to help them match the graphs to the equations. Some students may have trouble identifying that one graph is steeper than the others. Provide them with graph paper and a piece of patty-paper or a transparency and have them trace one graph onto it. They can overlay the traced graph on top of the other graphs to figure out which one is steeper. Students used similar tools to explore transformations in middle school.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share aspects of the equations and graphs they found helpful for the matching. If not mentioned in students' explanations, highlight the following features:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> The number being added or subtracted from \(x\) in the squared term, or the \(h\) in \((x&minus;h)^2\):
        <ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> If \(h\) is being subtracted from \(x\), \(h\) is a positive number and the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex is positive. </li>
<li> If \(h\) is being added to \(x\) in the expression, then \(h\) is a negative number and the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex is negative. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> The constant term in the quadratic expression in vertex form, or the \(k\) in \(a(x&minus;h)^2+k\):
        <ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> If \(k\) is positive, the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex is also positive. </li>
<li> If \(k\) is negative, the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex is also negative. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> The coefficient of the squared term, or the \(a\) in \(a(x&minus;h)^2+k\): We saw earlier that when the squared term has a negative coefficient, it makes all positive values negative. This means that:
        <ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> If \(a\) is negative, the vertex represents the maximum (the graph of the quadratic function opens downward). </li>
<li> If \(a\) is positive, the vertex represents the minimum (the graph of the quadratic function opens upward). </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> The magnitude of \(a\):
        <ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> The larger \(a\) is, the narrower the opening of the graph is (or the "steeper" the graph is). </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students may also reason the other way around: by looking at the graphs first and then relate the features of the graphs to the equations.</p>

<h4>Matching Graphs and Equations</h4>
<p>When matching graphs of quadratic functions and their equations, look for the matching vertex. Then look if the parabola is opening up or down. Finally, use another point to determine if the graph has been compressed or stretched. Recall this type of transformation will affect the \(a\)-value of the equation.</p>
<p>Looking at the graph below, choose the equation that matches the graph.</p>
<p><img height="296" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/e8f20cb5a53f3f5adc16739395465feb2a796acf" width="300"></p>
<ol type="a">
<li> \(y=(x-2)^2-3\) </li>
<li> \(y=(x+2)^2-3\) </li>
<li> \(y=-(x+2)^2-3\) </li>
<li> \(y=-(x-2)^2-3\) </li>
</ol>
<p>Step 1<br>
    Find the vertex.<br>
    The vertex is at \((-2, -3)\).</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
    Does the parabola open up or down?<br>
    The parabola opens up. So the leading coefficient is positive.</p>
<p>The correct answer is b. \(y=(x+2)^2-3\).</p>
<p>Remember the vertex form is \(y = a(x - h)^2 + k\). If the \(x\)-variable is being added in the parenthesis, the parabola has been shifted left.<br>
    The \((x + 2)\) moves the parabola left 2.<br>
    The -3 shifts it down 3 from the origin.</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
    Use the vertex form of the equation and write the parts you know: the coordinates of the vertex.<br>
    \(y=a(x+2)^2-3\)</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
    To solve for \(a\), find another point on the graph of the parabola and plug in those values for \(x\) and \(y\) in the equation you wrote.<br>
    Substitute the point \((-1, -2)\) into the equation to check the value of \(a\). We have hypothesized \(a = 1\), and with the coordinates from the second point, \(x = -1\) and \(y = -2\).</p>
<p>Step 5<br>
    Solve for \(a\).<br>
    \(-2 = a(-1 + 2)^2 - 3\). Now solve for \(a\) to find that \(a = 1\).</p>
<p>Step 6<br>
    Plug the value for \(a\) back into the equation.<br>
    So, \(y=(x+2)^2-3\).</p>

<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to match a graph and its equation:</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
    Find the vertex.<br>
    \((1, 2)\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
    Does the parabola open up or down?<br>
    Up &mdash; this means the leading coefficient is positive.</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
    Use the vertex form of the equation and write the parts you know: the coordinates of the vertex.<br>
    \(y=a(x-1)^2+2\)</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
    To solve for \(a\), find another point on the graph of the parabola and plug in those values for \(x\) and \(y\) in the equation you wrote.<br>
    \((0, 3)\) is also on the graph of this parabola. So, \(3=a(0-1)^2+2\).</p>
<p>Step 5<br>
    Solve for \(a\).<br>
    \(3=a(0-1)^2+2\)</p>
<p>\(3=a(-1)^2+2\)</p>
<p>\(3=a+2\)<br>
    \(1=a\)</p>
<p>Step 6<br>
    Plug the value for \(a\) back into the equation.<br>
    \(y=1(x-1)^2+2\)<br>
    \(y=(x-1)^2+2\)<br>
    The answer is d.</p>
