<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>The goal of this lesson is to examine how the numbers \(a\) and \(b\) influence the graph representing a function \(f\) defined by an equation of the form \(f(x)=a \cdot b^x\).</p>
<p>A money context is used in the first question to facilitate access. A bank account with more money is generally desirable, so students will be looking for the function that grows most quickly. The growth of the accounts is not realistic (unless more money is being added on a regular basis), and it has been chosen to motivate a close analysis of the growth factors.</p>
<p>As students work and discuss in groups, notice those who can articulate how \(a\) and \(b\) in an exponential function affect a graph that represents it. Ask them to share later.</p>
<p>This activity works best when each student has access to devices that can run the Desmos applet because students will benefit from seeing the relationship in a dynamic way.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2 and provide access to graphing technology.</p>
<p>Tell students to read the first question, and ask them: &ldquo;If the account were yours, which function would you choose: \(f\), \(g\), \(h\), or \(j\)?&rdquo; Give students a moment to discuss their choice and rationale with their partner. Then, tell students to read the second question and discuss with their partner which function&mdash;\(p\), \(q\), or \(r\)&mdash;they would choose.</p>
<p>Ask one partner to graph the functions in the first question and the other partner to graph the functions in the second question and then analyze their graphs together.</p>
<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>
<div>
  <p>Create a display of important terms and vocabulary. During the launch, take time to review terms that students will need to access for this activity. Invite students to suggest language or diagrams to include on a display that will support their understanding of exponential expressions in the form \(y=a \cdot b^x\).</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<ol>
  <li> Each of the following functions, \(f\), \(g\), \(h\), and \(j\), represents the amount of money in a bank account, in dollars, as a function of time \(x\), in years. They are each written in the form \(m(x)=a \cdot b^x\).<br>

      <li> Explain how changing the value of \(b\)<em>&nbsp;</em>changes the graph. <br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> When \(b\) is greater than 1, larger values of \(b\) mean that the function grows more quickly as \(x\) increases. A positive value of \(b\) that is less than 1 means the function is decreasing as \(x\) increases. <br>

      </li>
      <li> Explain how changing the value of \(d\)&nbsp;changes the asymptote of the graph. <br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> Changing the value of \(d\) changes the horizontal asymptote from \(y=0\) to \(y=d\). So function \(f(x)\) has a horizontal asymptote of \(y= 2\), and \(h(x)\) has a horizontal asymptote of \(y= -2\).<br>

<h4>Student-Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>As before, consider bank accounts whose balances are given by the following functions:</p>
<p>\(f(x)=10 \cdot3^x\) \(g(x)=3^{x+2}\) \(h(x)=\frac{1}{2} \cdot 3^{x+3}\)</p>
<p>Which function would you choose? Does your choice depend on \(x\)?</p>
<h4>Extension Student Response</h4>
<p>We can rewrite each of the functions as a multiple of \(3^x\) to more easily compare them:</p>
<p>\(f(x)=10 \cdot 3^x\)</p>
<p>\(g(x)=3^{x+2}=3^x \cdot 3^2 =9 \cdot 3^x\)</p>
<p>\(h(x)=\frac{1}{2} \cdot 3^{x+3}=\frac{1}{2} \cdot 3x \cdot 3^3=\frac{27}{2} \cdot 3^x=(13.5) \cdot 3^x\)</p>
<p>Since \(9&lt;10&lt;13.5\), we see that \(h\)&nbsp;has the most money for any value of \(x\).</p>
<h4> Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Once students have used graphing technology to graph four functions on the same set of axes, they may need help choosing a graphing window so that they can see salient features of all four graphs. They may also need help understanding how to determine which graph represents which function. (Some tools make it easier to distinguish than others.)</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite previously selected students or groups to share their responses. Discuss:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;On the graph, where do you see the \(a\) of each function? How does the size of \(a\) affect the graph?&rdquo; (The \(a\) is the \(y\)-intercept. The greater the \(a\), the higher it is on the vertical axis.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;On the graph, where do you see the \(b\) of each function? How does the size of \(b\) affect the graph?&rdquo; (The \(b\) appears in the steepness of the curve. When the function is characterized by exponential growth, the larger the \(b\), the steeper the curve, or the more quickly the quantity is growing or decaying.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How is the graph of \(j\) different from the other graphs?" (It represents a situation characterized by exponential decay: \(j(x)\) decreases as \(x\) increases.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How is the \(b\) value for function \(j\) different from those of the other functions?&rdquo; (The value of \(b\) is less than 1.)</li>
</ul><br>
<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<div>
  <p>As students discuss their ideas with a partner, listen for and collect the language students use to identify and describe how changing the values of \(a\) and \(b\) affect the graph. Write the students&rsquo; words and phrases on a visual display and update it throughout the remainder of the lesson. Remind students to borrow language from the display as needed. This will help students read and use mathematical language during their partner and whole-group discussions.</p>

<h4>Vertical Shifts with Exponential Functions</h4>
<p>The first transformation occurs when we add a constant<em>&nbsp;</em>\(d\)&nbsp;to the parent function \(f(x)=b^x\), giving us a vertical shift \(d\)&nbsp;units in the same direction as the sign. For example, if we begin by graphing a parent function, \(f(x)=2^x\), we can then graph two vertical shifts alongside it, using&nbsp;<span>\(d=3\): the upward shift, \(g(x)=2^x+3\), and the downward shift, \(h(x)=2^x-3\). Both vertical shifts are shown in the graph below.</span></p>

H OF X HAS A Y-INTERCEPT OF NEGATIVE 2 AND HORIZONTAL ASYMPTOTE OF Y EQUALS NEGATIVE 3." height="313" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/7e4f980c28fa87d22de67e4713b03950240021f3" width="300"></p>
<p>Observe the results of shifting \(f(x)=2^x\) vertically:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The domain, \((-\infty,\infty)\), remains unchanged. </li>
  <li> When the function is shifted up 3 units to \(g(x)=2^x+3\): </li>
  <ul>
    <li> The \(y\)-intercept shifts up 3 units to \((0,4)\). </li>
    <li> The asymptote shifts up 3 units to \(y=3\). </li>
    <li> The range becomes \((3,\infty)\). </li>
  </ul>
  <li> When the function is shifted down 3 units to \(h(x)=2^x-3\): </li>
  <ul>
    <li> The \(y\)-intercept shifts down 3 units to \((0,-2)\). </li>
    <li> The asymptote also shifts down 3 units to \(y=-3\). </li>
    <li> The range becomes \((-3, \infty)\).</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h4>Try It: Vertical Shifts with Exponential Functions</h4>
<p>Where would the horizontal asymptote be located for the graph of \(f(x)=4 \cdot 2^x-6\)?</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to find the equation of the horizontal asymptote:</p>
<p>In the function \(f(x)=4 \cdot 2^x-6\), the vertical shift is represented by &ndash;6.</p>
<p>The parent function, \(f(x)=2^x\), has a horizontal asymptote at \(y=0\). For the function \(f(x)=4 \cdot 2^x-6\), the horizontal asymptote will be shifted down 6 to \(y=-6\).</p>
