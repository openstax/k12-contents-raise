<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>This opening lesson introduces students to different types of polynomials. As students gain familiarity with these polynomial expressions, they will learn to recognize like terms within these expressions and combine them whenever possible. Students will also be able to perform these same operations while representing polynomials using function notation.</p>
<h4> Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Classify different types of polynomials as well as determine their degree. </li>
  <li> Fluently add and subtract polynomials by combining like terms whenever possible. </li>
  <li> Use function notation to represent polynomial functions and evaluate these functions for given values. </li>
  <li> Fluently add and subtract polynomial functions while checking their work. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Determine the degree of polynomials. </li>
  <li> Add and subtract polynomials. </li>
  <li> Evaluate a polynomial function for a given value. </li>
  <li> Add and subtract polynomial functions. </li>
</ul>

<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<p dir="ltr">Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>
   ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment
    </li>
  <li>
    ELPS 3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions
    </li>
  <li >
    ELPS 4(F) use visual and contextual support and support from peers and teachers to read grade-appropriate content area text, enhance and confirm understanding, and develop vocabulary, grasp of language structures, and background knowledge needed to comprehend increasingly challenging language
    </li>
  <li>
    ELPS 5(B) write using newly acquired basic vocabulary and content-based grade-level vocabulary
    </li>
</ul>
