<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>This opening lesson introduces students to different types of polynomials. As students gain familiarity with these polynomial expressions, they will learn to recognize like terms within these expressions and combine them whenever possible. Students will also be able to perform these same operations while representing polynomials using function notation.</p>
<h4> Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Classify different types of polynomials as well as determine their degree. </li>
  <li> Fluently add and subtract polynomials by combining like terms whenever possible. </li>
  <li> Use function notation to represent polynomial functions and evaluate these functions for given values. </li>
  <li> Fluently add and subtract polynomial functions while checking their work. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Determine the degree of polynomials. </li>
  <li> Add and subtract polynomials. </li>
  <li> Evaluate a polynomial function for a given value. </li>
  <li> Add and subtract polynomial functions. </li>
</ul>
