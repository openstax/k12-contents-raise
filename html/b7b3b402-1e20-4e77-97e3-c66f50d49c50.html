      <p>The three equations that could represent the quantities and constraints in this situation are:</p>

        <p>\(4n=c\), represents the number of cookies that each person will receive times the variable \(n\) which represents the number of people in the club equals the number of cookies that need to be purchased. This solution can work for any amount of club members.</p>
        <p>\(b=2(3)+3(4.50)\), represents Jada&rsquo;s budget.  The number of 1-gallon jugs of milk she needs times the cost of each jug, 2(3). Plus the number of packages of cookies she needs times the cost of each package, 3(4.50). She needs 12(15)=180 ounces of milk. She will purchase \(\frac{180}{128}=1.41\) gallon jugs, but since she can&rsquo;t buy .41 of a jug, she will have to buy 2 of them at $3.00 each. . She needs 4(15)=60 cookies.  She has to purchase \(\frac{60}{24}=2.5\) packages, but since she can&sbquo;t buy .5 of a package, she will have to buy 3 of them at $4.50 each. This solution can only work if she does not need more that 180 ounces of milk or 60 cookies and if the jugs of milk cost exactly $3.00 and the packages of cookies cost exactly $4.50.  </p>
