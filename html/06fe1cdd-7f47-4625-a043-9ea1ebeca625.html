<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students use a description and table of values to write an equation that represents them. Then,
  they interpret the equation for negative values of the exponent and produce a graph. They also interpret the numbers
  in the equation in terms of the context.</p>
<p>For the final question, only an estimate is possible. Expect different answers that range between 2 and 3 hours
  before the medicine was measured because a more precise answer cannot be given right now. Look for students who use
  the graph and try to extend it to values between integer hours. Invite them to share during the discussion.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>If students continue to use graphing technology while working on this task, they are likely to enter their equation
  and see a smooth curve. It is not the intention that they try to sketch a curve at this time. Draw their attention to
  the instructions that say to plot the points.</p>

<p>Answer the following questions. Double click on mathematical expressions/equations to enlarge.
</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Time \(t\)&nbsp;is measured in hours since the blood test, and amount of medicine in her body, \(m\), is measured
    in milligrams. What is the decay factor? That is, what is \(b\)&nbsp;in an equation of the form \(m=a\cdot
    b^t\)?<br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(b=\frac12\)
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li> What is \(a\)?<br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(a=100\)
  </li>
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Find the amounts of medicine in the patient&rsquo;s body when \(t\)&nbsp;is &ndash;1.<br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> When \(t\)&nbsp;is &ndash;1, \(m\)&nbsp;is 200.
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>Find the amounts of medicine in the patient&rsquo;s body when \(t\)&nbsp;is &ndash;3.
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> When \(t\)&nbsp;is &ndash;3, \(m\)&nbsp;is 800.
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>What does \(t=0\) mean in this context?
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(t=0\) means the time the doctor did the first blood test.
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
  <li>What does \(t=-3\) mean in this context?
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(t=-3\) means 3 hours before the doctor did the first test.

  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="7">
  <li>The medicine was taken when \(t\)&nbsp;is &ndash;5. Assuming the person did not have any of the medication in her
    body beforehand, how much medicine did the patient take?
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> 3,200 mg. Each hour, this is cut in half. After being halved 5 times, it leaves 100 mg, the
    amount of medicine in the person&rsquo;s body when \(t=0\).

  <li>Based on your graph, when do you think the patient will have: 500 mg of medicine remaining in her body

</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="10">
  <li>Based on your graph, when do you think the patient will have: No medicine remaining in her body
    <strong>Answer:</strong> <br> Your answer may vary, but here are some samples:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sometime after 10 hours. The amount of medicine falls below 0.1 mg after about 10 hours and might be too small
        to be detectable after that point.</li>
      <li> Eventually, all of the medicine will be out of the patient&rsquo;s body (but the mathematical model for the
        amount of medicine does not reach 0).</li>

  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> close to 1

  <p> <strong>Answer:</strong> close to 0
  </p>
  <li>\(\frac{1+2^{10}}{2^{-10}}\)</li><br>
  <p> <strong>Answer:</strong> much larger than 1
  </p>
</ol>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may struggle with understanding the negative time values. It may help to give clock values to the numbers.
  For example, the first blood test was done at 5:00 p.m. \((t=0)\). Ask students what \(t\)&nbsp;would be when it is
  6:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. It is important throughout this entire lesson to emphasize that time is not typically
  negative, but in this case is emphasizing events that happened prior to initial measurement.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Ask students how they labeled the axes on the graph. For the domain, it needs to include times from 3 hours before
  the medicine was measured to 2 hours after. (Students may also choose to include 5 hours before the first
  measurement.) The vertical axis should include 0 up to at least 800 (higher if students include the value for \(t=-5\)
  in the table).</p>
<p>Use the last question about when there was 500 mg of medicine to begin a discussion about values between integer
  hours. Elicit from students how the graph might look if we consider non-integer time values. If students still have
  access to graphing technology for this activity, they can enter their equation and see the curve for themselves.</p>
<p>Consider displaying the following graphs for all to see. Explain that if the amount of medicine in the bloodstream is
  plotted at time intervals smaller than 1 hour, the graph may look like the first graph. We sometimes graph a
  relationship where a quantity changes continuously using a curve, as in the second graph. Students will have more
  opportunities to consider non-integer domain values in upcoming lessons.</p>

    width="300"></p>
<p>To follow up on the last question, consider discussing: How long could the decrease by half go on? Is there a point
  at which it is no longer practical or reasonable to use the mathematical model?</p>

<h4>Interpreting Negative Exponents in Exponential Decay</h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a problem involving an exponential decay equation and negative exponents.</p>
<p>A scientist records the population of a bacterial population in a petri dish. The data are shown in the table.</p>

<br>
<p>The number of days \(d\) since the first test corresponds with the number of bacteria, \(b\), estimated to be alive
  in the petri dish.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> What is the decay factor? That is, what is \(f\) in an equation of the form \(b=n\cdot f^d\)? What is the
    starting population, \(n\), on the first day of testing? <br>
    <br>
    Since the number of bacteria found on day 0 is 40,000, then \(n = 40,000\). Since after each day, the number of
    bacteria is cut in half, then the decay factor, \(f\), is \(\frac12\). <br>
    <br>
    The equation to represent this situation is \(b=40,000\cdot\left(\frac12\right)^d\).
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> What do \(d=-1\) and \(d=-3\) mean in this context? <br>
    <br>
    Since the day the first test is taken is defined as \(d=0\), then days with a negative value occured before the
    first test. \(d=-1\) means 1 day before the scientist did the first test. \(d=-3\) means 3 days before the scientist
    did the first test.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> How many bacteria were present 1 day before the first test? <br>
    <br>
    Substitute &ndash;1 for \(d\) in the equation \(b=40,000\cdot\left(\frac12\right)^d\).<br>
    <br>
    \(b=40,000\cdot\left(\frac12\right)^d\) <br>
    \(b=40,000\cdot\left(\frac12\right)^{-1}\) <br>
    \(b=40,000\cdot 2\) <br>
    \(b=80,000\) <br>
    <br>
    There were 80,000 bacteria in the petri dish 1 day before the test.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> Assume the peak of the bacterial population was 3 days before the first test. How many bacteria were present at
    the peak of the population? <br>
    <br>
    Substitute &ndash;3 for \(d\) in the equation \(b=40,000\cdot\left(\frac12\right)^d\). <br>
    <br>
    \(b=40,000\cdot\left(\frac12\right)^d\) <br>
    \(b=40,000\cdot\left(\frac12\right)^{-3}\) <br>
    \(b=40,000\cdot 8\) <br>
    \(b=320,000\) <br>
    <br>
    There were 320,000 bacteria in the petri dish 3 days before the test at the peak of the
    population.
