<h4>Find the Line Parallel to a Given Line</h4>
<p>In this section, you will use what you know about writing the equation of a line given the slope and a point to write the equation of parallel lines. The graph shows the equation of the line&nbsp;\( y = 2x - 3. \) The point&nbsp;\( P \)&nbsp;\( (-2, 1) \) is also plotted. You can use the fact that parallel lines have the same slope to find a line that is parallel to line \(m\) and goes through point \( P \) \( (-2, 1) \).&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="This figure has a graph of a straight line and a point on the x y-coordinate plane. The x and y-axes run from negative 8 to 8. The line goes through the points (0, negative 3), (1, negative 1), and (2, 1). The point (negative 2, 1) is plotted. The line does not go through the point (negative 2, 1)." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="324" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/51e2911a4ca1a2e6fa4aaaf1120031d5db87a061" width="317"><br></p>
 
<p>From the equation, you know the slope of the line is 2. The second line will pass through \(&nbsp;(-2, 1)&nbsp;\) and have slope 2. To graph the line, start at \(&nbsp;(-2, 1)&nbsp;\) and count out the rise and run. The slope is \( \frac{rise}{run}=\frac{2}{1} \). Count out the rise, 2, and run, 1, and plot the point. You can graph the line as shown. Line \(&nbsp;m&nbsp;\) is parallel to line \(&nbsp;l&nbsp;\) and goes through point \(&nbsp;P \) \( (-2, 1)&nbsp;\).</p>

The first line goes through the points (0, negative 3), (1, negative 1), and (2, 1). The points (negative 2, 1) and (negative 1, 3) are plotted. The second line goes through the points (negative 2, 1) and (negative 1, 3)." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="324" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/1e8ed5a345016b88a6a1d0363ca7fd31843d9198" width="317"><br></p>
<p>To find the equation of a line parallel to a line through a given point algebraically, you can use what you know about finding the equation of a line given the slope and a point.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Write an equation of a line parallel to&nbsp;\( y = 2x - 3 \) that contains the point \( (-2, 1) \). Write the equation in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p><b>Step 1 -</b> Find the slope of the given line.<br>
The line is in slope-intercept form \( y = 2x - 3 \)<br>
\( m=2 \)</p>
<p><b>Step 2 - </b> Find the slope of the parallel line<br>
Parallel lines have the same slope<br>
\( m_1 = 2 \)</p>
<p><b>Step 3 - </b>Identify the point<br>
The given point is \( (-2, 1) \)<br>
\( (x_1, y_1) = (-2, 1) \)</p>
<p><b>Step 4 - </b>Substitute values into the point-slope form \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \)<br>
Simplify<br>
\(\begin{array}{rcl}y-y_1&amp;=&amp;(x-x_1)\\y-1&amp;=&amp;(x-(-2))\\y-1&amp;=&amp;(x+2)\\y-1&amp;=&amp;x+4\end{array}\)</p>
<p><b>Step 5 - </b>Write the equation in slope-intercept form<br>
\( y = 2x + 5 \)</p>
<p>Look at the graph with the parallel lines shown previously. Does this equation make sense? What is the \(y\)-intercept of the line? What is the slope?</p>
<p>You can use this table as a reference for writing an equation of a line parallel to a given line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Write the equation in slope-intercept form: \( y = mx+b \).</p>
