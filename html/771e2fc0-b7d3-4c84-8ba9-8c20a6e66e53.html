      <div class="body">
        <p>Invite groups to share their strategies and record them for all to see. If not already described by students, apply each strategy using the values in the table, or ask students to give an example of how it could be applied.</p>
        <p>Some students may notice that each time \( x \) increases by 2, \(y \) increases by 8 more than the previous time. Others may notice that the \(y \)-values are 1 less than the square numbers 1, 4, 9, 25, and 49, and that these numbers are the squares of the listed \( x\)-values, and from there concluded that the relationship is along the lines of: &ldquo;square \( x\) and subtract 1 to get \(y \).&rdquo; Neither of these observations is essential, but consider asking if they see any special patterns in either column that could help determine the relationship.</p>
        <p>If no one mentions plotting the pairs of values as a way to understand the relationship between \( x\) and \( y\), and if time permits, consider displaying a graph such as the one shown (or displaying a blank coordinate plane and plotting the points together).</p>
