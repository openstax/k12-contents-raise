<p>The number of texts a teen sends, \(T\), in days, \(d\), is shown in the table below.</p>
<table class="os-raise-horizontaltable">

<th scope="row">Days, \(d\)</th>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>

<p>Write an equation in slope-intercept form to represent the situation then predict the number of texts sent in 8 days.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Find the \(y\)-intercept.<br>
Since the value when \(d=0\) is not present, work backwards to \(d=0\).&nbsp;<br>
If \(d=0\) was present, then \(T=0\) since as each x-value increases by 1, the \(y\)-values increase by 65.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Find the slope of the situation.<br>
Find the rate of change. The change in y is 65 and the change in \(x\) is 1, so the slope is 65</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> -Write the equation in slope-intercept form.<br>
\(y=mx+b\)<br>
\(T=65d +0\)<br>
\(T=65d\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 </strong>-Make a prediction.<br>
Substitute \(d=8\) into the equation.<br>
\(T=65(8)=520\)</p>
<p>After 8 days, the teen would have sent 520 texts.</p>

<p>Write an equation in slope-intercept form to represent the situation then predict the cost of a dog staying at doggie daycare after 7 days.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 </strong>- Find the \(y\)-intercept.<br>
Since the value when \(d=0\) is not present, work backwards to \(d=0\).&nbsp;<br>
If \(d=0\) was present, then \(C=0\) since as each \(x\)-value increases by 1, the \(y\)-values increase by 35.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 </strong>- Find the slope of the situation.<br>
Find the rate of change. The change in \(y\) is 35 and the change in \(x\) is 1, so the slope is 35</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> -Write the equation in slope-intercept form.<br>
\(y=mx+b\)<br>
\(C=35d +0\)<br>
\(C=35d\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> -Make a prediction.<br>
Substitute \(d=7\) into the equation.<br>
\(C=35(7)=245\)</p>
<br>
<p>After 7 days, the cost of doggie daycare would be $245.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Find the \(y\)-intercept.<br>
Since the value when \(h=0\) is not present, work backwards to \(h=0\).&nbsp;<br>
If \(h=0\) was present, then \(F=0\) since as each \(x\)-value increases by 1, the y-values increase by 120.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Find the slope of the situation.<br>
Find the rate of change. The change in \(y\) is 120 and the change in \(x\) is 1, so the slope is 120</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> -Write the equation in slope-intercept form.<br>
\(y=mx+b\)<br>
\(F=120h+0\)<br>
\(F=120h\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> -Make a prediction.<br>
Substitute \(h=8\) into the equation.<br>
\(F=120(8)=960\)</p>
<p>Naomi can paint 960 square feet in 8 hours.</p>
