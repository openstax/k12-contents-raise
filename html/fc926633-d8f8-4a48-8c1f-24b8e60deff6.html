<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> Explain the steps and complete some missing steps for deriving the quadratic formula. </li>
  <li> Explain how the quadratic formula is related to the process of completing the square for a quadratic equation \(ax^2+bx+c=0\). </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> 9.10.1: Deriving the Quadratic Formula, Part 1
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you learned how to derive the quadratic formula by completing the square for a quadratic equation without evaluating some of the numerical expressions along the way.</li>
      <li>9.10.1: Self Check</li>
      <li>9.10.1: Additional Resources</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> 9.10.2: Deriving the Quadratic Formula, Part 2
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you studied a series of steps to solve \(ax^2+bx+c=0\) by completing the square and making sense of how it leads to the quadratic formula.</li>
      <li>9.10.2: Self Check</li>
      <li>9.10.2: Additional Resources</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> 9.10.3: Understanding That the Quadratic Formula Is the Combined Steps of Completing the Square
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you had to explain parts of a solution for solving an equation by completing the square, where each step was shown, but numerical expressions were not evaluated.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
