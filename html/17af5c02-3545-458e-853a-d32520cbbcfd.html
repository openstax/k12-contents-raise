<p>The key takeaways of this lesson are that parallel lines have the same slope while perpendicular lines have slopes that are opposite reciprocals of each other. Students should be able to identify the slope of a line from a graph or equation. Then, they should be able to use it along with another point to write the equation of a parallel or perpendicular line.<br></p>
<p>Students should also be able to write lines that are parallel or perpendicular to the \( x \)-axis and \( y \)-axis and understand that the equations are written as \( y \) = # or \( x \) = #, respectively.<br></p>
<p>Visual learners can benefit from graphing lines throughout the lesson by hand or via graphing technology so that they can see the slopes of the lines as well as the \( y \)-intercepts.<br><br></p>
