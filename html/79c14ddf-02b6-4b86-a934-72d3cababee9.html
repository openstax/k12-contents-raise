<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement </h4>
<p>The college student who is looking for a data plan for her cell phone found a third option, which also offers a 2-gigabyte monthly allowance for data.</p>
<p>The monthly cost of this option can be represented by function \(C\), defined by \( C(x)=30x+5\), where \(x\) is the gigabytes of data used over the monthly allowance.</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Find \(C(0.7)\) and explain what it means in this situation. </li>
<li>Her budget is still $50 a month. To find out how many gigabytes of data she could use if she chose this plan, she writes&nbsp;\(C(x)=50\)&nbsp;and solves for \(x\). What value of \(x\) makes this equation true? Explain your reasoning. </li>
</ol>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>\(C(0.7)=26\) because \(30(0.7)+5=26\). Here is a possible explanation: It means that the cost would be $26 if she used 0.7 gigabyte over the 2-gigabytes allowance in a month. </li>
<li>\(x=1.5\). Here is a possible explanation: Because \( C(x)=30x+5\), we can write \(C(x)=50\) as \(30x+5=50\) and solve for \(x\), which gives 1.5. </li>
</ol>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>Press Pause</h5>
<p>At this point, students need to be able to evaluate and interpret equations given in function notation. If students continue to struggle, select examples of cool-downs from this unit to highlight and clarify misconceptions, and then have students work to revise cool-downs and reflect on their misconceptions. Practice problems 1, 3, 4, and 5 from this lesson all provide opportunities for practice and additional formative assessment.</p>
