<p>In this lesson, you will learn about functions. You will examine examples of functions and their representations in context.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explain when a relationship between two quantities is a function.</li>
  <li>Identify independent and dependent variables in a function, and use words and graphs to represent the function.</li>
  <li>Explain what descriptions and graphs of functions tell us about situations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>4.1.1: Contrasting Two Relationships by Reasoning</li>
  <li>4.1.2: Reasoning Graphically About the Relationship between the Two Quantities<ul>
      <li>4.1.2: Self Check</li>
      <li>4.1.2: Additional Resources</li>
