<h4>Choosing an Effective Strategy to Solve Quadratic Equations</h4>
<p>You have learned various strategies to solve quadratic equations in different forms. If possible, try to use reasoning before graphing an equation.</p>
<p>Let's look at some examples.</p>
<p><strong>Using Reasoning and the Square Root Property</strong></p>
<p>Equations such as these can be solved by reasoning and using the <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="&ldquo;1.0&rdquo;" data-store="glossary-tooltip">square root property</span>.</p>
<p>Example 1<br>
  \(x^2=81\) <br>
  \(x=9\) and \(x=-9\) </p>
<p>Example 2 <br>
  \(x^2+7=56\)<br>
  \(x^2=49\)<br>
  \(x=7\) and \(x=-7\)</p>
<p>Example 3<br>
  \((x+1)^2=9\)<br>
  \(x=2\) and \(x=-4\)</p>
<p>Each equation above is different in some way, but they all can be solved using the same process.</p>
<p><strong>Using Reasoning and the Zero Product Property</strong></p>
<p>Equations such as these can be solved by reasoning and using the <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="&ldquo;1.0&rdquo;" data-store="glossary-tooltip">zero product property</span>.</p>
<p>Example 1<br>
  \((x&minus;4)(x+5)=0\)<br>
  \(x=4\) and \(x=-5\)</p>
<p>Example 2<br>
  \((x+3)(2x+7)=0\)<br>
  \(x=-3\) and \(x=-72\)</p>
<p><strong>Using Graphing to Solve</strong></p>
<p>Some equations might require graphing to be solved. One method is to rearrange the equation such that it is in the form of <em>expression</em> \(= 0\). Then graph \(y\) = <em>expression</em>, and find the \(x\)-intercepts to identify the solutions.</p>
<p>Given: \((x+2)(x&minus;1)=4\)</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Rewrite the equation to set it equal to 0.<br>
  \((x+2)(x&minus;1)&minus;4=0\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Graph the equation with \(y\) = the expression that equals zero.<br>
  Graph \(y=(x+2)(x&minus;1)&minus;4\).</p>

<p>Step 3<br>
  Identify the \(x\)-intercepts from the graph.<br>
  This graph has two \(x\)-intercepts at \((-3,0)\) and \((2,0)\).</p>
<p>The original equation \((x+2)(x&minus;1)=4\) has two solutions at \(x=-3\) and \(x=2\).</p>
