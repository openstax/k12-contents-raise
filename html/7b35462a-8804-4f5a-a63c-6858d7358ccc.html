<h3>Cool Down (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>A group of biologists is surveying the mice population in a forest. The equation \(n=75\cdot 3^t\) gives the total number of mice, \(n\), \(t\) years since the survey began. Explain what the numbers 75 and 3 mean in this situation.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 75 is the initial number of mice in the forest when the survey started, or the number of mice when \(t\) is 0. The 3 is the growth factor or constant ratio, meaning that each year, the population of mice in the forest is 3 times the previous year&rsquo;s population.</p>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
