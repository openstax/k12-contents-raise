  <p>In this culminating project, students integrate ideas from the unit. Students collect, summarize, interpret, and draw conclusions from bivariate data using scatter plots, best fit lines, residuals, and correlation coefficients. This connects to previous work because students summarized, represented, interpreted, and drew conclusions from bivariate data using scatter plots, best fit lines, residuals, and correlation coefficients. This connects to upcoming work because students will continue to investigate data using conditional probability and statistical experiments.</p>
  <p>Technology isn&rsquo;t required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems. We recommend making technology available. When students collect and analyze data to answer a question, they are making sense of problems and persevering in solving them.</p>

<li> Technology is highly suggested for this lesson to support student calculations of the correlation coefficient and the line of best fit. There are also opportunities for students to research their own data about sports teams and penalties if they have access to devices that can access the internet. If students do not have access to technology, copies of a lesson guide from Illustrative Mathematics includes data that can be used.</li>
<li>When students can research their own data, provide materials for them to create a visual display containing their information and any conclusions they make to share with the class.</li>
