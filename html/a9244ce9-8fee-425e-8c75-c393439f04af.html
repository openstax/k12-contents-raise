<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)
</h3>
<p>In this warm-up, students are given a simple equation in three variables and are prompted to rearrange it to pin down
  a particular variable. In each question, only the value of one variable is given, so students need to manipulate the
  equation even when some quantities are unknown. The work here prepares students to rearrange other variable equations
  later in the lesson.</p>
<p>As students work, look for those who substitute the given value before rearranging and those who first isolate the
  variable of interest before substituting. Invite them to share their approaches during class discussion.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. For the last question, ask each partner to come up with a new equation.<br></p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>In an earlier lesson, you saw the equation \( V + F - 2 = E \), which relates the number of vertices, faces, and
  edges in a Platonic solid.</p>
  <p>In questions 1 and 2, write an equation that makes it easier to find the number of vertices in each of the Platonic solids described:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>An octahedron (shown here), which has 8 faces</li>
</ol>
    <img alt="Three dimensonal octahedron. Two triangular pyramids joined at rectangular bases. &nbsp;"

      <br>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(V=E-6\)</p>
      <p><br>
        \(V+8−2=E\)<br>
        \(V+6=E\)<br>
        \(V=E-6\)</p>
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
      <li>An icosahedron, which has 30 edges</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(V=32-F\)</p>
    <p><br>
      \(V+F−2=30\)<br>
      \(V+F−2+2=30+2\)<br>
      \(V+F=32\)<br>
      \(F=32-F\)
    </p>
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
      <li>A Buckminsterfullerene (also called a &ldquo;Buckyball&rdquo;) is a polyhedron with 60 vertices. It is not a
      Platonic solid, but the numbers of faces, edges, and vertices are related the same way as those in a Platonic
      solid.<br><br>
    Write an equation that makes it easier to find the number of faces a Buckyball has if we know how many edges it
      has.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(F=E−58\)</p>
    <p>
      \(V+F−2=E\)<br>
      \(60+F−2=E\)<br>
      \(58+F=E\)<br>
      \(58-58+F=E-58\)<br>
      \(F=E-58\)<br>
    </p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may be unclear about what it means to write an equation that &ldquo;makes it easier to find the number
  of vertices (or faces).&rdquo; Remind them of the work in an earlier activity. In the post-parade clean-up activity,
  for instance, they wrote the equation \( \ell = \frac{2}{n} \) to quickly find the length of the road section each
  volunteer would clean up, \( \ell \), if there were \( n \) volunteers. They wrote \( n=\frac{2}{\ell} \) to quickly
  find the number of volunteers, \( n \), if each volunteer were to clean up \( \ell \) miles.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select previously identified students to share their responses and strategies. Record and display for all to see the
  steps they take to rearrange the equations. Emphasize how each step constitutes an acceptable move and how it keeps
  the equation true.</p>
<p>Make sure students see that we can substitute known values into the given equation before rearranging it, or we can
  rearrange the equation first before substituting known values. In the examples here, it doesn&rsquo;t matter which way
  it is done. Ultimately, we were solving for \( V \) in the first question and for \( F \) in the second question.</p>
<p>Explain that there will be times when one strategy might be more helpful than the other, as students will see in
  subsequent activities.</p>
