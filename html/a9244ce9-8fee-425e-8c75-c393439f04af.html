      <h3>Warm-Up (5 minutes)
      </h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>In this warm-up, students are given a simple equation in three variables and are prompted to rearrange it to pin down a particular variable. In each question, only the value of one variable is given, so students need to manipulate the equation even when some quantities are unknown. The work here prepares students to rearrange other variable equations later in the lesson.</p>
        <p>As students work, look for those who substitute the given value before rearranging and those who first isolate the variable of interest before substituting. Invite them to share their approaches during class discussion.</p>

      <h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>In an earlier lesson, you saw the equation <span class="math math-repaired">\( V + F - 2 = E \)</span>, which relates the number of vertices, faces, and edges in a Platonic solid.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Write an equation that makes it easier to find the number of vertices in each of the Platonic solids described:</p>

            <p>A Buckminsterfullerene (also called a &ldquo;Buckyball&rdquo;) is a polyhedron with 60 vertices. It is not a Platonic solid, but the numbers of faces, edges, and vertices are related the same way as those in a Platonic solid.</p>
            <p>Write an equation that makes it easier to find the number of faces a Buckyball has if we know how many edges it has.</p>

      <h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>Some students may be unclear about what it means to write an equation that &ldquo;makes it easier to find the number of vertices (or faces).&rdquo; Remind them of the work in an earlier activity. In the post-parade clean-up activity, for instance, they wrote the equation <span class="math math-repaired">\( \ell = \frac{2}{n} \)</span> to quickly find the length of the road section each volunteer would clean up, <span class="math math-repaired">\( \ell \)</span>, if there were <span class="math math-repaired">\( n \)</span> volunteers. They wrote <span class="math math-repaired">\( n=\frac{2}{\ell} \)</span> to quickly find the number of volunteers, <span class="math math-repaired">\( n \)</span>, if each volunteer were to clean up <span class="math math-repaired">\( \ell \)</span> miles.</p>

      <h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>Select previously identified students to share their responses and strategies. Record and display for all to see the steps they take to rearrange the equations. Emphasize how each step constitutes an acceptable move and how it keeps the equation true.</p>
        <p>Make sure students see that we can substitute known values into the given equation before rearranging it, or we can rearrange the equation first before substituting known values. In the examples here, it doesn&rsquo;t matter which way it is done. Ultimately, we were solving for <span class="math math-repaired">\( V \)</span> in the first question and for <span class="math math-repaired">\( F \)</span> in the second question.</p>
        <p>Explain that there will be times when one strategy might be more helpful than the other, as students will see in subsequent activities.</p>
