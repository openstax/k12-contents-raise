<h4>Lesson Narrative&nbsp;</h4>
<p dir="ltr">In this lesson, students continue to practice relating the structure of equations to the situation and corresponding graphs. They use their understanding of constraints, equations, and points on a graph to explain whether a graph represents an equation and a situation. Along the way, students practice reasoning quantitatively and abstractly and constructing logical arguments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students also work with the structure of linear equations outside of contextual situations. They analyze and rearrange equations to determine the slope and y-intercept of their graphs and practice explaining their reasoning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Technology isn't required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems. We recommend making technology available.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)&nbsp;</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Determine the slope and vertical intercept of the graphs of linear equations by making use of structure or by rearranging the equations.</li>
  <li>Write an equivalent equation of the form \( y=mx+b \), given an equation of the form \( ax+by=c \).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Find the slope and vertical intercept of a line with equation \( ax+by=c \).</li>
  <li>Take an equation of the form&nbsp;\( ax+by=c \) and rearrange it into the equivalent form \( y=mx+b \).</li>
  <li>Use a variety of strategies to find the slope and vertical intercept of the graph of a linear equation given in different forms.</li>
</ul>
