<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students continue to practice relating the structure of equations to the situation and corresponding
  graphs. They use their understanding of constraints, equations, and points on a graph to explain whether a graph
  represents an equation and a situation. Along the way, students practice reasoning quantitatively and abstractly and
  constructing logical arguments.</p>
<p>Students also work with the structure of linear equations outside of contextual situations. They analyze and
  rearrange equations to determine the slope and y-intercept of their graphs and practice explaining their reasoning.
</p>
<p>Technology isn't required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate
  technology to solve problems. We recommend making technology available.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Determine the slope and vertical intercept of the graphs of linear equations by making use of structure or by
    rearranging the equations.</li>
  <li>Write an equivalent equation of the form \( y=mx+b \), given an equation of the form \( ax+by=c \).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Find the slope and vertical intercept of a line with equation \( ax+by=c \).</li>
  <li>Take an equation of the form \( ax+by=c \) and rearrange it into the equivalent form \( y=mx+b \).</li>
  <li>Use a variety of strategies to find the slope and vertical intercept of the graph of a linear equation given in
    different forms.</li>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS.  The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A1(C) use strategic learning techniques such as concept mapping, drawing, memorizing, comparing, contrasting, and reviewing to acquire basic and grade-level vocabulary</li>
  <li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audio tape, video, DVD, and CD ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
  <li>A3(B) expand and internalize initial English vocabulary by learning and using high-frequency English words necessary for identifying and describing people, places, and objects, by retelling simple stories and basic information represented or supported by pictures, and by learning and using routine language needed for classroom communication</li>
  <li>A3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions</li>
  <li>A3(I) adapt spoken language appropriately for formal and informal purposes</li>
</ul>
<h4>Support for Building Character</h4>
<p>Throughout this unit, find ways to encourage and support students to work on cultivating their <strong>social
    intelligence</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to try during this lesson:</p>
