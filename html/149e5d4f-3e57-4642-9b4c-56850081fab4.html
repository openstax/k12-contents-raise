<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students use the structure they saw earlier to rewrite squared expressions of the form
  \((kx+m)^2\), where \(k\) is not 1, into standard form. Through repeated reasoning, students see how the coefficient
  \(k\) is related to the values of \(a\) and \(b\) when the expression is expanded into \(ax^2+bx+c\), and how the
  \(m\) is related to \(c\).</p>
<p>As students work, monitor for the following strategies for rewriting the expressions in the first question (from
  factored form to standard form):</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Drawing rectangular diagrams. </li>
  <li> Applying the distributive property, writing out all the expanded terms, and combining like terms. </li>
  <li> Generalizing that when expanding an expression such as \((4x+1)^2\): </li>
  <ul>
    <li> The coefficient 4 in \(4x+1\) gets squared, so \(a\) in \(ax^2+bx+c\) is \(4^2\). </li>
    <li> The coefficient 4 in \(4x+1\) gets multiplied by the constant term 1 twice, so \(b\) is \(2(4)(1)\). </li>
    <li> The constant term 1 in \(4x+1\) is squared, so \(c\) is \(1^2\). </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>Identify students using each strategy and invite them to share during the class discussion.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Explain to students that they will now practice squaring expressions such as \(4x+1\) and \(\frac{1}{2}x+7\), where
  the coefficient of the linear term is not 1, and writing them in standard form.</p>
<p>Consider arranging students in groups of two and asking them to think individually about each question before
  conferring with their partner.</p>

    observations, display frames that encourage students, in their partner groups, to create generalizations from their
    observations that they can share with the whole class. For example, “_____ will always _____ because . . . .” and

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select previously identified students to share their responses and strategies for the first question, starting with
  students who used diagrams and ending with students who generalized the pattern in the rewriting process. As students
  explain, display or record their reasoning for all to see.</p>
<p>If not mentioned in students' explanations, highlight the generalization noted in the activity narrative.</p>
<p>Then, discuss how students used their insights from the first question to help them identify perfect squares, or to
  turn expressions into perfect squares, in the second question. Make sure students see the structure behind the values
  of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) when the expression \(ax^2+bx+c\) is a perfect square. This structure will help them
  complete the square in the next activity.</p>

<h4>Factoring Perfect Square Trinomials</h4>
<p>To factor class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip"&gt;perfect square
  trinomials, follow the formulas:</p>
<p>\(a^2+2ab+b^2=(a+b)^2\)</p>
<p>\(a^2-2ab+b^2=(a-b)^2\)</p>
<p>Let's look at an example of how to factor perfect square trinomials.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Factor \(9x^2+12x+4\).</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Does the trinomial fit the perfect square trinomial pattern, \(a^2+2ab+b^2\)? If so, write the first term as \(a^2\)
  and last constant as \(b^2\).</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Is the first term a perfect square? Write it as a square, \(a^2\). <br>
    Is \(9x^2\) a perfect square? <br>
    Yes &mdash; write it as \((3x)^2\). <br>
    \(\begin{array}{l}9x^2\;+\;12x\;+\;4 \\ (3x)^2\;\end{array}\) </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Is the last term a perfect square? Write it as a square, \(b^2\). <br>
    Is 4 a perfect square? <br>
    Yes &mdash; write it as \((2)^2\). <br>
    \(\begin{array}{l}9x^2\;+\;12x\;+\;4 \\ (3x)^2\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(2)^2\end{array}\) </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Check the middle term. Is it \(2ab\)?<br>
    Is \(12x\) twice the product of \(3x\) and 2? <br>
    Does it match? <br>
    Yes, so we have a perfect trinomial. </li>
</ul>
<p>\(\begin{array}{c}9x^2\;\;\;\;\;\;+\;\;\;\;\;\;12x\;\;\;\;\;\;+\;\;\;\;\;\;4\; \\
  (3x)^2\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(2)^2 \\
  (3x)^2\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(2)^2 \\
  {\style{color:green}\searrow}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;{\style{color:green}\swarrow}
  \\ 2(3x)(2) \\ 12x\;\end{array}\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Factor the binomial into: \(a^2+2ab+b^2 = (a+b)^2 \) <br>
  \(9x^2+12x+4\) <br>
  \(\begin{array}{l}a^2\;\;\;\;\;\;+2\cdot a\cdot b+b^2 \\ \;({\style{color:red}3}{\style{color:red}x})^2\;+2 \cdot
  {\style{color:red}3}{\style{color:red}x} \cdot {\style{color:purple}2}+{\style{color:purple}2}^2\; \\
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;(a+b)^2\; \\
  \;\;\;\;\;({\style{color:red}3}{\style{color:red}x}+{\style{color:green}2})^{\style{color:green}2}\end{array}\) </p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Check. <br>
  \((3x+2)^2\) <br>
  \((3x)^2+2 \cdot 3x \cdot 2+2^2\) <br>
  \(9x^2+12x+4 ✔\) </p>
<h4>Try It: Factoring Perfect Square Trinomials</h4>
<p>Factor \(9x^2-30x+25\).</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to factor a perfect square trinomial:</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Write the first term as \(a^2\) and the last constant as \(b^2\). <br>
  \(a^2=(3x)^2\), \(b^2=5^2\) </p>
<p>Make sure the middle term is \(2ab\).<br>
  \(2ab=2(3x)(5)=30x\) </p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Factor the binomial into: \(a^2-2ab+b^2=(a-b)^2\). <br>
  \((3x-5)^2\) </p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Check. </p>
<p>\((3x-5)(3x-5)\)<br>
  \(=9x^2-15x-15x+25\) <br>
  \(=9x^2-30x+25\) </p>
