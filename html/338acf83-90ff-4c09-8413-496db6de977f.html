<h3> Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>The graph shows the population of beavers in a forest for different numbers of years after 1995. The beaver population is growing exponentially.</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> Explain why we can think of the beaver population as a function of time in years. <br>
<br>
<strong>ANSWER:</strong> The number of beavers depends on time in years. In any given year, there is a particular number of beavers in the forest. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li> What is the meaning of the point labeled \(Q\) in this context? <br>
<br>
<strong>ANSWER:</strong> The point \(Q\) indicates that 3.5 years after 1995, the beaver population was about 550.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li> Write an equation using function notation to represent this situation. <br>
<br>
<strong>ANSWER:</strong> \(p(t)=50 \cdot 2^t\) where \(t\)&nbsp;is years after 1995 and \(p(t)\) is the beaver population at that time.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<p>If students struggle with function notation, there will be more chances throughout the unit to strengthen their understanding, so there is no need to slow down. However, if students are misinterpreting the scales on the graph, spend a few minutes in the next lesson, perhaps during Activity 2, eliciting strategies for correctly interpreting axes.</p>
