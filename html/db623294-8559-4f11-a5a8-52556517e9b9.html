<h4> Lesson Narrative&nbsp;</h4>
<p>This lesson returns to a theme from the beginning of the unit, revisiting the fact that exponential functions grow
  more quickly, eventually, than linear functions. The first activity compares simple interest (linear growth) with
  compound interest (exponential growth). Students examine tables and graphs and see that the exponential function
  quickly overtakes the linear function. In the second activity, the exponential function is deliberately chosen to grow
  slowly over a large domain, making it less clear whether the exponential function will overtake the linear function.
</p>
<p>Other activities provide an opportunity for students to strategically use technology, whether they make a graph (for
  which they will need to think carefully about the domain and range) or continue to tabulate explicit values of the two
  functions (likely with the aid of a calculator for the exponential function). This lesson provides multiple
  opportunities for students to justify their reasoning and critique the reasoning of others.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Use graphs and calculations to show that a quantity that increases exponentially will eventually surpass one that
    increases linearly. </li>
  <li> Use tables, calculations, and graphs to compare growth rates of linear and exponential functions. </li>
  <li> Write and use equations of exponential functions written in function notation to compare scenarios. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Use tables, calculations, and graphs to compare growth rates of linear and exponential functions and predict how
    the quantities eventually change. </li>
</ul>
