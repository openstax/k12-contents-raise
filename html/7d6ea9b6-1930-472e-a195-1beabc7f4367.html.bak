<p><strong><em>Students will complete the following questions to practice the skills they have learned in this lesson.</em></strong></p>
<p>Use the following scenario and graph to answer question 1. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Functions \(R\) and \(D\) give the height, in feet, of a toy rocket and a drone, \(t\) seconds after they are released.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are the graphs of \(R\) (for the rocket) and \(D\) (for the drone).</p>
<p><img alt="A graph shows height in feet vs. time in seconds. Two curves, D (a flat-topped shape) and R (a parabola), both rise, but R peaks near 2 seconds and descends, while D stays flat from 2 to 5 seconds, then drops." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/6953fee5f8d02223583c335e6d1949b8e372de5f"/></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The three graphs represent the progress of three runners in a 400-meter race.<br/>
    The solid line represents Runner A. The dotted line represents Runner B. The dashed line represents Runner C.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Line graph showing three curves of distance (meters) versus time (seconds). All start at zero, then rise quickly.
