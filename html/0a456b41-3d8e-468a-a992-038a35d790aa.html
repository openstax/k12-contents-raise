<h4>Standard Form of Quadratics</h4>
<p><strong>Examples of Standard Form Quadratics</strong></p>
<p>\(x^2\)</p>
<p>\(x^2-9\)</p>
<p>\(x^2-3x\)</p>
<p>\(x^2+4x-45\)</p>
<p>These examples have an \(x^2\) and lead with it. Some have an \(x\) term or a constant term but it is not needed to be in standard form. Standard form of a quadratic expression is of the form \(ax^2+bx+c\), where \(a \neq 0\).</p>
<p><strong>Non-Examples of Standard Form Quadratics</strong></p>
<p>\(7-x\)</p>
<p>\(9(x-2)\)</p>
<p>\(x(x+10)\)</p>
<p>These examples do not have an \(x^2\) term.</p>

<p>Here is how to determine if the expression is in standard form:</p>
<p>This expression is in factored form. If the \(4x\) is distributed, the expression becomes \(4x^2-8x\), which is in standard form.</p>
