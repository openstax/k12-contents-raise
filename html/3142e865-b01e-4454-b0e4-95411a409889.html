<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>The scatter plot shows the maximum noise level when different numbers of people are in a stadium. The linear model is given by the equation \(y = 1.5x + 22.7\), where \(y\) represents maximum noise level and \(x\) represents the number of people, in thousands, in the stadium.</p>
<p>\(y = 1.5x + 22.7\)</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>The slope of the linear model is 1.5. What does this mean in terms of the maximum noise level and the number of people?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> For example: For every additional thousand people in the stadium, the noise level increases by about 1.5 decibels.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>A sports announcer states that there are 65,000 fans in the stadium. Estimate the maximum noise level. Be prepared to show your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 120.2 decibels</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Is this estimate reasonable?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Compare your answer: Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.</p>
<p>It is a reasonable value since the data seem to fit a linear model well, so it is probably near this value.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>What is the ùë¶-intercept of the linear model given?&nbsp; Be prepared to show your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The ùë¶-intercept is (0, 22.7).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>What does the value of the y-intercept mean in the context of the problem?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Compare your answer:</p>
<p>The point (0, 22.7) means a stadium with no people in it will have a maximum noise level of 22.7 decibels.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
  <li>Is this value for the y-intercept reasonable?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Compare your answer: Your answer may vary, but here are some samples.</p>
<ul>
  <li> This is actually reasonable since a whisper is about 20 decibels. </li>
  <li> This is not reasonable since it should be silent with no people in the stadium. </li>
  <li> This is not reasonable because the point is so far from the data that it is unlikely that the linear model will be accurate. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>Points to emphasize</h5>
<p>This is a great opportunity to highlight that we have to look at axes and demonstrate the usefulness of using an equation for a fit line, rather than sketching on a graph. This will be revisited in the Lesson 3.2 cool down.</p>
