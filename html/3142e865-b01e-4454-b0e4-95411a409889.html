<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The scatter plot shows the maximum noise level when different numbers of people are in a stadium. The linear model is given by the equation \(y = 1.5x + 22.7\), where \(y\) represents maximum noise level and \(x\) represents the number of people, in thousands, in the stadium.</p>
<p dir="ltr">\(y = 1.5x + 22.7\)</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>The slope of the linear model is 1.5. What does this mean in terms of the maximum noise level and the number of people?</li>
  <li>A sports announcer states that there are 65,000 fans in the stadium. Estimate the maximum noise level. Is this estimate reasonable? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</li>
  <li>What is the \(y\)-intercept of the linear model given? What does it mean in the context of the problem? Is this reasonable? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li><span>For example: For every additional thousand people in the stadium, the noise level increases by about 1.5 decibels.</span></li>
  <li>120.2 decibels. For example: It is a reasonable value since the data seem to fit a linear model well, so it is probably near this value.</li>
  <li>The \(y\)-intercept is (0,22.7), which means a stadium with no people in it will have a maximum noise level of 22.7 decibels. Sample reasonings:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>This is actually reasonable since a whisper is about 20 decibels.</li>
      <li>This is not reasonable since it should be silent with no people in the stadium.</li>
      <li>This is not reasonable because the point is so far from the data that it is unlikely that the linear model will be accurate.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>Points to emphasize</h5>
<p>This is a great opportunity to highlight that we have to look at axes and demonstrate the usefulness of using an equation for a fit line, rather than sketching on a graph. This will be revisited on the Lesson 3.2 cool down.</p>
