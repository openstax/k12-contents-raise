<p>In this lesson, you will begin to rewrite quadratic expressions from standard to factored form. You will look at expressions of the form \((x + m)(x + n)\) and \((x &minus; m)(x &minus; n)\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are positive.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> Explain how the numbers in a quadratic expression in factored form relate to the numbers in an equivalent expression in standard form. </li>
  <li> Rewrite a quadratic expression in standard form when given the quadratic expression in factored form. </li>
  <li> Rewrite a quadratic expression in factored form when given the quadratic expression in the form of \(x^2+ bx + c\). </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
