<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>This lesson explores the meaning of rational exponents. Students begin reviewing how to simplify numbers using radicals with given roots. They start with square roots and perfect squares and move to make conclusions about cubed roots.</p>
<p>In the following activities, students work to write radicals as terms with rational exponents and vice versa. They then work to apply the properties for exponents to terms that include rational exponents.</p>
<p>In the cool-down, students also revisit negative exponents when exploring how properties work with rational exponents.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Simplify radical expressions with even and odd indexes. </li>
  <li> Rewrite radicals as terms with rational exponents and vice versa. </li>
  <li> Use properties for exponents with rational exponents. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Simplify radical expressions with even and odd indexes. </li>
  <li> Rewrite expressions with rational exponents as roots. </li>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p>
<ul>
  <li>ELPS 1(F) use accessible language and learn new and essential language in the process</li>
  <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
  <li>ELPS 3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions</li>
</ul>
