<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>This lesson explores the meaning of rational exponents. Students begin reviewing how to simplify numbers using radicals with given roots. They start with square roots and perfect squares and move to make conclusions about cubed roots.</p>
<p>In the following activities, students work to write radicals as terms with rational exponents and vice versa. They then work to apply the properties for exponents to terms that include rational exponents.</p>
<p>In the cool-down, students also revisit negative exponents when exploring how properties work with rational exponents.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Simplify radical expressions with even and odd indexes. </li>
<li> Rewrite radicals as terms with rational exponents and vice versa. </li>
<li> Use properties for exponents with rational exponents. </li>
</ul>
