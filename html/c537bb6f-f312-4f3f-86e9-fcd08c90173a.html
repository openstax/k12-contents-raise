<li> Graph A is the only graph that has a positive vertical intercept and a positive horizontal intercept. It is the only one that has a constant, negative rate of change. </li>
<li> Graph B is the only graph that is not a continuous curve and has multiple pieces. It is the only one that shows both points and lines. </li>
<li> Graph C is the only graph that has a constant \(y\)-value. </li>
<li> Graph D is the only graph whose \(y\)-value increases and decreases multiple times. It is the only graph that is not a simple line or curve and that has wave-like features. </li>
