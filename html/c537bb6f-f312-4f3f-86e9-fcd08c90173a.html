    Graph A doesn't belong because:
    <ul>
<li> It is the only graph that has a positive vertical intercept and a positive horizontal intercept. </li>
<li>It is the only one that has a constant, negative rate of change.
      </li>
</ul>
    Graph B doesn't belong because:
    <ul>
<li> It is the only graph that is not a continuous curve and has multiple pieces.
      </li>
<li>It is the only one that shows both points and lines.
      </li>
</ul>
    Graph C doesn't belong because:
    <ul>
<li> It is the only graph that has a constant y-value.
      </li>
</ul>
    Graph D doesn't belong because:
    <ul>
<li>It is the only graph whose y-value increases and decreases multiple times.
      </li>
<li>It is the only graph that is not a simple line or curve and that has wave-like features.
