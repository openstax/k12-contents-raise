<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity further refreshes students&rsquo; understanding of functions through contextual examples. Here students
  are prompted to reason graphically about the relationship between the two quantities in the situation: time, in
  seconds, and the distance, in feet, of a dog from a post. Students also recall the meaning of independent and
  dependent variables.</p>
<p>Students are given descriptions of the dog&rsquo;s movement while it was attached to a post and are asked to sketch
  corresponding graphs. Along the way, students interpret each point on the graph to mean a particular point in time and
  a particular distance from the post.</p>
<p>Students later reason that the relationship between time and distance is a function because the dog can only be in
  one location at any time. For instance, the dog could not be both 5 feet and 1.7 feet away from the post at the same
  time.</p>
<p>As students work, notice if any students create a graph with a vertical value greater than 5, or a graph that does
  not go through the two given points. If many graphs show these features, discuss with the class why the former is not
  possible and why the latter does not match the given descriptions.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Read the task statement and the descriptions about the dog owner and his three days of dog walking.</p>
<p>Provide students with a copy of the RAISE 4.1.2 Activity <a

<p>Discuss features of a graph that could represent the dog&rsquo;s movement on Day 3 and display a possible graph. An
  example is shown here.</p>

<p>Keep students in groups of 4. Ask 2 group members to graph the dog's movement on Day 1, and the other 2 members to
  graph the movement on Day 2. </p>
<p>One person who graphed day 1 should pair with someone who graphed day 2. Students should explain their graphs and
  help partners change the graphs where needed.</p>
  <p><strong>Digital graphing strategy</strong> - To graph day 3, have students access the GeoGebra link https://www.geogebra.org/classic/z8zah6ak to open a blank graph for the dog movement scenario. Provide students with the following prompting questions:
    If the dog was 1.5 feet from the post when the owner left him outside the store, how much time has passed? What point does this represent? (t = 0; (0, 1.5) is the point that students will need to graph.)   
    If the dog is 4 feet away from the post after 60 seconds, what point does this represent? ((60, 4) is the point that students will need to graph.)
    To graph the points (0, 1.5) and (60, 4), students can enter the points in the Input menu on the left side of the screen or they plot the points on the graph by using the Point tool. (Students click on the point tool to activate it, then click on the locations for the points on the graph.) <br><img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/3e3cc5668c7e71f61e7d39edcc4ee325abb02791"><br>
    Now, have the students use the Freehand Shape tool (accessed through the Move tool menu) to draw the graph that is described by the dogâ€™s movement on Day 3. <br><img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/883c36c2e2a85e591a039802b0f933e5c05c3d7f"></p>
    
    
    <p>Students can reload the page to create their digital graphs for Days 1 and 2 or they can continue adding to their graph using the Freehand Shape tool and the left input menu. (Note that students can select/de-select the previous freehand shape or delete it.)
    </p>
    <h4>Student Activity</h4>
    <p>Three days in a row, a dog owner tied his dog&rsquo;s 5-foot-long leash to a post outside a store while he ran into
  the store to get a drink. Each time, the owner returned within minutes.</p>
<p><img alt="Dog with leash tied to a post." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="269"
    src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/9a5d6fa9e01c7f7cf997ea941c0a1d3244058568" width="300"></p>
<p>The dog&rsquo;s movement each day is described here.</p>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Day 1: The dog walked around the entire time while waiting for its owner.</li>
  <li>Day 2: The dog walked around for the first minute and then laid down until its owner returned.</li>
  <li>Day 3: The dog tried to follow its owner into the store but was stopped by the leash. Then, it started walking
    around the post in one direction. It kept walking until its leash was completely wound up around the post. The dog
    stayed there until its owner returned.</li>
  <li>Each day, the dog was 1.5 feet away from the post when the owner left.</li>
  <li>Each day, 60 seconds after the owner left, the dog was 4 feet from the post.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Your teacher will assign one of the days for you to analyze. You will sketch a graph that could represent the
  dog&rsquo;s distance from the post, in feet, as a function of time, in seconds, since the owner left.<br></p>
<p>Then, meet with someone in your group who had Day 2&rsquo;s movement and someone who had Day 3&rsquo;s movement. Work
  together to explain your graphs and make changes where needed before checking your work. Be sure to sketch each
  other&rsquo;s graphs.</p>

<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>From the graph, is it possible to tell how many times the dog changed directions while walking around? Be prepared to
  show your reasoning.</p>
<h4>Extension Student Response</h4>
<p>For example: No. The graph only gives the distance from the post. The dog could change from moving clockwise around
  the post to moving counterclockwise around the post. These changes could not be seen on the graph.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select some students to share their graphs and a brief explanation of how the graphs match the descriptions.</p>
<p>One takeaway from this activity is that the relationship between the time since the owner left and the dog&rsquo;s
  distance from the post is a function. Solicit as many explanations as possible as to why this is. To emphasize that a
  function is a relationship in which one output is assigned to every input, explain that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The dog can only be in one spot at a time and cannot have more than one distance away from the post at any time.
  </li>
  <li>On each graph, we can see that only one value for distance corresponds to each value for time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;In this situation, what is the input and what is the output?&rdquo; (It makes sense for time in seconds to
    be the input and distance from the post to be the output.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Is it possible for the distance to be the input and the time to be the output? Why or why not?&rdquo; (It
    is possible, but if the distance is the input, the relationship is no longer a function. This is because there could
    be multiple possible times at which the dog is a certain distance away from the post.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Remind students that a quantity that is an input for a function is called an independent variable, and a quantity
  that is an output is called a dependent variable. In this case, time is independent and distance from the post is
  dependent.</p>
<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<div>
  <p>Use this routine to support reading comprehension. Use the first read to orient students to the situation. After a
    shared reading, ask students, &ldquo;What is this situation about?&rdquo; (A dog&rsquo;s movement while the owner
    ran into a store.) Use the second read to identify quantities and relationships. Ask students what can be counted or
    measured without focusing on the values. Listen for, and amplify, the important quantities that vary in relation to
    each other in this situation: distance from the post and time in seconds. After the third read, ask students to
    brainstorm possible strategies to answer the question. This helps students connect the language in the word problem
    and the reasoning needed to solve the problem while keeping the cognitive demand of the task.</p>
</div>
<br>
<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>
<div>
  <p>Represent the same information through different modalities by using physical objects to represent abstract
    concepts. Use a three-dimensional prop to represent the situation and the dog&rsquo;s movement. This prop might use
    a dowel rod for the post and a piece of string or yarn for the leash. Viewing or manipulating the prop can help
    students better understand the context and quantities involved.</p>

<h4>Representing Everyday Situations with Graphs</h4>
<p>Drawing functions to represent everyday situations can be useful to provide a visual for what is happening in a
  situation.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>The graph shows the distance \(y\), in miles, for the time of each of Mia&rsquo;s runs \(x\), in minutes.</p>
<img alt class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="309" role="presentation"
  src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/47e87f88703430456aedc8bf9dcbd12271521e45" width="300">
<br>
<p>Notice that at 0 minutes, Mia has run 0 miles. At 30 minutes, Mia has run 3 miles. At 180 minutes, Mia has run 18
  miles.</p>
