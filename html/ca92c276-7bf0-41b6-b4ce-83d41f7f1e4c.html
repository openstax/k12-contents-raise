<p>In this lesson, you will encounter a problem that cannot be easily solved by familiar strategies. After exploring different ways to solve the problem, you will write a quadratic equation to model the situation. You will also interpret what the solution to that equation means in the given context.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>
    Explain the meaning of a solution to an equation in terms of a situation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a quadratic equation that represents a situation.
  </li>
</ul>
