<p>In this lesson, you will continue to practice relating the structure of equations to the situation and corresponding graphs. You will use your understanding of constraints, equations, and points on a graph to explain whether a graph represents an equation and a situation. Along the way, you will practice reasoning quantitatively and abstractly and constructing logical arguments.<br><span><br>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:<br><br></span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Find the slope and vertical intercept of a line with equation \( ax+by=c \).</li>
  <li>Take an equation of the form \( ax+by=c \) and rearrange it into the equivalent form \( y=mx+b \).</li>
  <li>Use a variety of strategies to find the slope and vertical intercept of the graph of a linear equation given in different forms.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
