<h4>Cool Down Activity</h4>
<p>To prepare for a backyard party, a parent uses two identical hoses to fill a small pool that is 15 inches deep and a large pool that is 27 inches deep.</p>
<p>The height of the water in each pool is a function of time since the water is turned on.</p>
<p><img alt="A woman is filling a large above-ground pool with a hose, while a smaller inflatable kiddie pool with stars is nearby, also filling with water on a grassy area." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c466027622a96eb3bdb0f8fbbcb0c9a69dba861e" width="350"/></p>
<p>Here are descriptions of three situations. For each situation, sketch the graphs of the two functions on the same coordinate plane, so that <em>S(t)</em> is the height of the water in the small pool after <em>t</em> minutes, and <em>L(t)</em> is the height of the water in the large pool after <em>t</em> minutes.</p>
<p>In both functions, the height of the water is measured in inches.</p>
<br/>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="1">
<li>Situation 1: Each hose fills one pool at a constant rate. When the small pool is full, the water for that hose is shut off. The other hose keeps filling the larger pool until it is full.</li>
</ol>
