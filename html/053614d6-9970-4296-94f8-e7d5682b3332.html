<h4>Why Does Growth Mindset Matter?</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Having a growth mindset helps you focus on developing your abilities rather than proving how smart or talented you are. Compared to a fixed mindset, a growth mindset encourages you to embrace challenges, sustain effort, and try new strategies&mdash;and that&rsquo;s true for both children and adults. Of course, no one embodies only a growth or fixed mindset; we are all a mixture of the two, and we can learn to recognize what triggers a fixed versus growth mindset. Shown evidence that the brain is like a muscle&mdash;something you can strengthen&mdash;students adopt more of a growth mindset about intelligence and earn higher grades. Finally, the concept of growth mindset doesn&rsquo;t only apply to intelligence: If there are qualities you don&rsquo;t like about yourself or others, keep in mind that people can change.</p>
<h4>How Do I Encourage a Growth Mindset in My Students?</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Consider some of these suggestions for promoting a growth mindset in your classroom:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Model it.</strong> Share stories of when you fell short of your expectations but nevertheless learned an important lesson: &ldquo;I made the wrong decision that day. At first, I avoided thinking about it, but eventually I realized I needed to learn from the mistake. What I realized was&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Celebrate it.</strong> Avoid praising young people for being &ldquo;gifted,&rdquo; &ldquo;talented,&rdquo; or &ldquo;a natural.&rdquo; Instead, praise the process of learning: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so proud of you&mdash;when you got stuck on the problem, you tried a different way to solve it and didn&rsquo;t give up!&rdquo; Emphasizing strategic choices rather than effort alone is key to developing a growth mindset.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Enable it.</strong> Create authentic opportunities for learning. Give students meaningful challenges, consistent support, and timely, constructive feedback. To calibrate your efforts, ask them directly: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s set a stretch goal together&mdash;what&rsquo;s something you want to accomplish but can&rsquo;t do yet? What can I do to help?&rdquo;</p>
