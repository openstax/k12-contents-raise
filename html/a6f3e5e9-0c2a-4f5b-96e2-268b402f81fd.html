<h3> Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity continues to examine exponential decay in the context of successive ball bounces. Students use the
  given data to calculate a rebound factor and use it to write a function that models the relationship between number of
  bounces and bounce heights. They then use the function to answer questions about the ball and its bounces.</p>
<p>Students also think about the domain of the function and address the fact that this is a discrete context, i.e., it
  does not make sense to examine \(\frac23\) of a bounce, so the graphs should not be continuous.</p>
<h4> Launch</h4>

<h5> Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>
  <p>Activate or supply background knowledge about discrete and continuous contexts. The number of bounces is counted
    every time the ball hits the floor. If a student asks about \(1\frac12\) bounces, clarify that would be measuring
    the time since the ball had been released, not the number of bounces; a &ldquo;bounce&rdquo; is the event of hitting
    the floor and changing direction.</p>
</div>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>

  <li> Is this ball more or less bouncy than the tennis ball in activity 5.11.2, which has the equation \(h=150 \cdot
    (0.53)^n\)? Explain or show your reasoning. <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> This ball is more bouncy. Each bounce of this ball reaches a height that is about 0.7 times
    that of the previous bounce \((51.5 \div 73.5 \approx 0.7)\). The tennis ball in the earlier task loses about half
    of its height with each bounce.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> From what height was the ball dropped? Explain or show your reasoning. Remember your units! <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> 150 centimeters; \(73.5 \div 0.7=105\) and \(105 \div 0.7=150\).
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> Write an equation that represents the bounce height of the ball, \(h\), in centimeters after \(n\) bounces. <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(h=150 \cdot (0.7)^n\)
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> Which graph would more appropriately represent the equation for \(h\): Graph A or Graph B? Be prepared to show
    your reasoning. <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> Graph B is more appropriate. Only whole-number \(n\) values make sense in this context. We
    cannot have bounce number 3.4, for example.<br>

      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li> Will the nth bounce of this ball be lower than the nth bounce of the tennis ball? Be prepared to show your
    reasoning. <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> No, the height of this ball after any given bounce will not be lower than that of the
    tennis ball because they were dropped from the same height and this ball has a greater rebound factor, so it will
    always bounce up to a higher point than the tennis ball.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>If students struggle to make sense of the graph, remind them that the horizontal axis depicts the number of bounces,
  not the height of the ball or time. Although height and time are continuous, the number of bounces is discrete.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share how they decided on the bounciness of the balls and to reflect on their reasoning process:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;How are the data here different from the data in the first activity?&rdquo; (In this case, the successive
    quotients are very close to the same value, making the choice of rebound factor more straightforward.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;When working with the table, how is calculating the missing value in the row above a given value different
    from calculating a missing value in the row below?&rdquo; (To find the missing value in the row above, we need to
    divide by the rebound factor rather than multiply.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;In the final question, why are both the initial height and the bounciness important?&rdquo; (The value of
    \(h\) is found by multiplying the initial height by the rebound factor \(n\) times, so both values matter.) </li>
</ul>

      <p>Use this routine to help students reflect on their reasoning process in deciding on the bounciness of the balls.
    Before the whole-class discussion, arrange students in groups of 2. Provide the following sentence frames as
    partners share their ideas: &ldquo;In the table, I noticed that . . .&rdquo;; &ldquo;I interpreted the successive
    quotients to mean . . .&rdquo;; or &ldquo;The equation helped determine the bounciness by . . . .&rdquo; This will
    help students make sense of exponential decay through discussing the ball-bouncing situation with a partner.</p>

<h4> Writing Exponential Decay Functions</h4>
<p>A car sells for $4,000 and loses \(\frac18\) of its value each year. Write a function that gives the car&rsquo;s
  value, \(V(t)\), \(t\) years after it is sold.</p>
<p>Since the car loses \(\frac18\) of its value each year, it keeps \(\frac78\) of its value from year to year, so the
  growth factor is \(\frac78\).</p>
<p>\(V(t)=4000 \cdot (\frac{7}{8})^t\)</p>
<h4>Try It: Writing Exponential Decay Functions</h4>
<p>A computer is purchased for $1,000 and loses \(\frac15\) of its value per year.</p>
<p>Write a function for the computer&rsquo;s value, \(V(t)\), \(t\)&nbsp;years after it is purchased.</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to write the exponential function:</p>
<p>The starting amount is $1,000. The computer loses \(\frac15\) of its value each year, so it maintains \(\frac45\) of
  its value. The growth factor is \(\frac45\).</p>
<p>The function is then \(V(t)=1000 \cdot (\frac{4}{5})^t\).</p>
