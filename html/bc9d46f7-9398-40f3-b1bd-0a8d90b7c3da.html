<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>Prior to this point, students have described characteristics of graphs, made sense of points on the graphs, and interpreted them in terms of a situation. In this lesson, students develop this work more formally, while continuing to use the idea of function as the focusing lens.</p>
<p>Students use mathematical terms such as &ldquo;intercept,&rdquo; &ldquo;maximum,&rdquo; and &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; in their graphical analyses, and they relate features of graphs to features of the functions represented. For instance, they look at an interval in which a graph shows a positive slope and interpret that to mean an interval where the function&rsquo;s values are increasing. Students also use statements in function notation, such as \(h(0)\) and \(h(t)=0\), to talk about key features of a graph.</p>
<p>By now, students are familiar with the idea of intercepts. Note that in these materials, the terms &ldquo;horizontal intercept&rdquo; and &ldquo;vertical intercept&rdquo; are used to refer to intercepts more generally, especially when a function is defined using variables other than \(x\) and \(y\). If needed, clarify these terms for students who may be accustomed to using only \(x\)-intercept and \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p>As students look for connections across representations of functions and relate them to quantities in situations, they practice making sense of problems and reasoning quantitatively and abstractly. Using mathematical terms and notation to describe features of graphs and features of functions calls for attention to precision.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Analyze connections between statements that use function notation and features of graphs and describe (orally and in writing) these connections.</li>
  <li>Interpret key features of a graph&mdash;the intercepts, maximums, minimums, and the intervals when the function is increasing or decreasing&mdash;in terms of a situation.</li>
  <li>Understand and be able to use the terms &ldquo;horizontal intercept,&rdquo; &ldquo;vertical intercept,&rdquo; &ldquo;maximum,&rdquo; and &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; when talking about graphs of functions.</li>
</ul>
<h4> Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Identify important features of graphs of functions and explain what they mean in the situations represented.</li>
  <li>Explain and apply the terms &ldquo;horizontal intercept,&rdquo; &ldquo;vertical intercept,&rdquo; &ldquo;maximum,&rdquo; and &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; when talking about functions and their graphs.</li>
  <li>Identify important features of linear functions.</li>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners
</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(F) ask and give information ranging from using a very limited bank of high-frequency, high-need, concrete vocabulary, including key words and expressions needed for basic communication in academic and social contexts, to using abstract and content-based vocabulary during extended speaking assignments
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 4(D) use prereading supports such as graphic organizers, illustrations, and pretaught topic-related vocabulary and other prereading activities to enhance comprehension of written text
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 5(B) write using newly acquired basic vocabulary and content-based grade-level vocabulary
  </li>
</ul>
