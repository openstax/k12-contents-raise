<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>In previous lessons, students learned to derive the zeros of a quadratic function from its standard form or factored
  form. In this activity, students will convert from a function's zeros to its factored form and standard form. Students
  will also practice this process after analyzing the graph of a quadratic function.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Answer questions 1 – 3 to familiarize students with the process of converting
  from zeros to the standard form of a function. Pause and allow students to ask any questions. Then allow each pair to
  complete questions 4 – 11 on their own. Emphasize that questions 9 – 11 are the same as the preceding
  questions, except that students must analyze the graph to find the zeros. </p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>In previous lessons, you learned about the relationship between a quadratic function's zeros and the binomial factors
  in the factored form of the equation. Use this information to answer the following questions. If needed, review
  activities 8.9.3 and 8.10.3.</p>
<p>Use the "^" symbol to enter exponents.</p>
<p>Questions 1 – 3 refer to a quadratic equation that has the zeros –3 and 4. </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> Write the factored form of this equation set equal to zero. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \((x + 3)(x − 4) = 0\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li>Now, write the standard form of the same quadratic equation.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x^2 − x − 12 = 0\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
<li>Write the quadratic equation as the function \(f(x)\).</li>

<p>So a quadratic equation that has the zeros –3 and 4 can be expressed as a function \(f(x) = x^2 − x
  − 12\).</p>
<p>For questions 4 – 8, identify a quadratic function in standard form, \(f(x)\), with the given zeros.</p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may not remember how to approach questions 7 and 8, since they only have one solution, or zero. Remind
  students these are double roots, where the same solution is represented twice. If another hint is needed, tell
  students that in the factored form for each question, the binomial will repeat itself.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>To review key ideas from the activity, discuss the following questions:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>"Can you convert directly from the zeros of a function to standard form?" (No, the zeros of a function can be
    converted into factored form, which can then be converted into standard form.) </li>
<li>"How can you convert the graph of a quadratic function into its standard form?" (Analyze the graph to find the
    zeros, or solutions, of the function. Use the zeros to write the function in factored form. Use FOIL to write the
    factored form in standard form.) </li>
</ul>

        That's correct! Check yourself: Substitute the zeros in for \(x\) and check to see the function equals 0. \(
        (5)^2 + 2(5) − 35 = 0\), and \((-7)^2 + 2(-7) − 35 = 0\).

        Incorrect. Let's try again a different way: The factored form of the quadratic function is \(g(x) = (x −
        5)(x + 7)\). Use the distributive property, or FOIL, to find the answer. The answer is \(g(x) = x^2 + 2x −

    their experience with the self check. Students will not automatically have access to this content, so you may wish

<h4>Finding a Quadratic Function from Its Zeros</h4>
<p>Given the zeros of a quadratic function, we can write it in standard form.</p>
<p>Let's look at an example.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Write a function, \(h(x)\), that has the zeros 5 and –3. </p>
<p>We know that if the zeros are 5 and –3, then the factor equations that were solved are:</p>
<p> \(x − 5 = 0\)     and      \(x + 3 = 0\).</p>
<p>When these equations are solved, they provide the zeros 5 and –3.</p>
<p>We can use these equations to write the function in factored form. </p>
<p>\(h(x) = (x − 5)(x + 3)\)</p>
<p>By using the distributive property, or FOIL, we can find the standard form of the function.</p>
<p>\(h(x) = x^2 − 2x − 15\)</p>
<p>Recall that sometimes a function might have only one zero.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Write a function, \(d(x)\), that has one zero at 8. </p>
<p>From previous lessons, we know that when the factor equations were identical, there was only one zero.</p>
<p>\(x − 8 = 0\)     and      \(x − 8 = 0\)</p>
<p>The factored form of this equation is \(d(x) = (x − 8)(x − 8)\).</p>
<p>After using the distributive property, or FOIL, the standard form of the function is \(d(x) = x^2 − 16x + 64\).
</p>
<p>Finding the zeros from a graph follows the same process.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>
<p>Write a function, \(z(x)\), that corresponds to the graph shown.</p>
<p><img alt="A parabola that opens up with \(x\)-intercepts of negative 4 and negative 1." height="401" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/275d6a012dadfe653c8c8c85afb810bddf633f4b" width="401"/></p>
<p>The zeros of the graph are –4 and –1. The resulting factor equations are:</p>
<p>\(x + 4 = 0\)     and      \(x + 1 = 0\).</p>
<p>The factored form of this equation is \(z(x) = (x + 4)(x + 1)\).</p>
<p>After using FOIL, the standard form of the function is \(z(x) = x^2 + 5x + 4\).</p>
