<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Facing Statement</h4>
<p>Function \(Q\) gives a puppy&rsquo;s weight, in pounds, as a function of its age, in months.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>What does each expression or equation represent in this situation?
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="A">
      <li>\(Q(18)\)</li>
      <li>\(Q(30)=27.5\)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Use function notation to represent each statement.
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="A">
      <li>When the puppy turned 12 months old, it weighed 19.6 pounds.</li>
      <li>When the puppy was \(m\) months old, it weighed \(w\) pounds.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>A. the weight of the puppy when it was 18 months old <br>
    B. When the puppy was 30 months old, it weighed 27.5 pounds. </li>
  <br>
  <li>A. \(Q(12)=19.6\)<br>
    B. \(Q(m)=w\)</li>
</ol>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
