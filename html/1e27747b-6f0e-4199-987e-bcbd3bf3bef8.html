        <h3>Student Response</h3>
        <p>Graph C. Compare your answer:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I tested 2, 3, and 4 for the values of \(x\), and 3 and 4 make the inequality true.</li>
          <li>I solved a related equation and then tested a couple of values on either side of the solution.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Response to Student Thinking</h3>
        <h4>More Chances&nbsp;</h4>
        <p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
        <p>A later activity offers another opportunity to discuss determining if a solution set is greater than or less than a boundary value.</p>
