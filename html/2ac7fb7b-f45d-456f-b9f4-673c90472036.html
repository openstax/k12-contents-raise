<p>Display a series of equations that, prior to this lesson, students could only solve by graphing.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>\(x^2+3x &minus; 18 = 0\)</p>
<p>\(x^2&minus; 4 = 5x\)</p>
<p>\(x(x &minus; 7) = -6\)</p>
<p>\(2x^2 &minus; 9x + 10 = 0\)</p>
<p>\((x + 6)(x &minus; 6) = 11\)</p>
<p>Ask students to choose an equation that they think they could solve without graphing. Then, ask them to explain to a partner why they believe they could solve the equation.</p>
<p>Consider displaying \((x + 9)(x &minus; 9) = 19\) for all to see and using it as an example: "I think I can solve \((x + 9)(x &minus; 9) = 19\) because I know the expression on the left is equivalent to \(x^2&minus; 9^2\) and I can rewrite the equation as \(x^2 &minus; 81 = 19\), which I can solve by rearranging the terms."</p>
<p>Then, ask if any of the equations appear to be unsolvable other than by graphing and why. Of the equations shown here, \(2x^2&minus; 9x + 10 = 0\) is the only one that students aren&rsquo;t yet equipped to solve because the coefficient of \(x^2\) is not 1. Students will begin looking at such equations in an upcoming lesson.</p>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
