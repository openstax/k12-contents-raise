<h4> Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>The purpose of this lesson is for students to understand what makes a sequence an arithmetic sequence and to connect
  it to the idea of a linear function. Arithmetic sequences are characterized by adding a constant value to get from one
  term to the following term, just as linear functions are characterized by a constant rate of change.</p>
<p>Building from their thinking about geometric sequences, students begin this lesson comparing three different
  sequences. By articulating how the sequences are alike and different, they demonstrate the need for precise language
  (TEKS A1(G)). Next, students consider two arguments for what type of sequence is represented in a table, and then they
  use a graph of the sequence to justify why it could be arithmetic. Throughout the lesson, students will work with and
  create different representations of functions.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Compare and contrast (orally and in writing) arithmetic and geometric sequences.
  </li>
  <li>
    Determine the rate of change of an arithmetic sequence.
  </li>
  <li>
    Interpret tables and graphs to determine if a sequence is arithmetic or geometric.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Explain what it means for a sequence to be arithmetic or geometric.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
  <li>A3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions</li>
  <li>A4(D) use prereading supports such as graphic organizers, illustrations, and pretaught topic-related vocabulary and other prereading activities to enhance comprehension of written text</li>
</ul>
<h4>Support for Building Character</h4>
<p>Throughout this unit, find ways to encourage and support students to work on cultivating their
  <strong>creativity</strong>.</p>
