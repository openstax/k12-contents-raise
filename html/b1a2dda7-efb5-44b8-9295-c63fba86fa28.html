<h4>Cool Down Activity</h4>
<p>For each pair of variables, decide whether there is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a very weak or no relationship</li>
  <li>a strong relationship that is not a causal relationship</li>
  <li>a causal relationship</li>
</ul>
<!-- Begin Question1-->
<div class="os-raise-ib-input" data-button-text="Solution" data-content-id="82d308f2-fb71-49b3-b583-3a04e46ee728" data-schema-version="1.0">
  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-content">
    <p>1. Number of snow plows owned by a city and mitten sales in the city<br></p>
  </div>
  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-prompt">
    <p>Enter your answer here:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-ack">
    <p>Compare your answer:</p>
    <p>A strong relationship that is not a causal relationship. The variables are related since cities with more snow plows will probably also have high sales of mittens compared to places with fewer snow plows. The climate, number of people living in the city, and amount of snow all affect both of these variables. A city having extra snow plows would not cause people to buy more mittens, nor would the reverse happen.

<!-- Begin Question2-->
<div class="os-raise-ib-input" data-button-text="Solution" data-content-id="6340014a-03c5-4fdf-bacf-90f7d147f319" data-schema-version="1.0">
  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-content">
    <p>2. Number of text messages sent per day by a person and number of shirts owned by the person<br></p>
  </div>
  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-prompt">
    <p>Enter your answer here:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-ack">
    <p>Compare your answer:</p>
    <p>A very weak or no relationship. These variables seem unrelated, and there is not another variable like age or wealth that would seem to be related to both of these variables consistently.
    </p>
  </div>

<!-- Begin Question3-->
<div class="os-raise-ib-input" data-button-text="Solution" data-content-id="52563f75-b57d-4bab-b557-da113b2847b3" data-schema-version="1.0">
  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-content">
    <p>3. Price of a pizza and number of calories in the pizza<br></p>
  </div>
  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-prompt">
    <p>Enter your answer here:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-ack">
    <p>Compare your answer:</p>
    <p>A strong relationship that is not a causal relationship. The variables are related since a more expensive pizza will generally be larger or have more toppings, leading to more calories, but it is the size or number of toppings that is the cause for the increase in both variables.
    </p>
  </div>

<!-- Begin Question4-->
<div class="os-raise-ib-input" data-button-text="Solution" data-content-id="b919ed97-320b-448e-bf7c-9c672f919328" data-schema-version="1.0">

    <p>4. Amount of gas used on a trip and number of miles driven on the trip<br></p>

  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-prompt">
    <p>Enter your answer here:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-ack">
    <p>Compare your answer:</p>
    <p>Causal relationship. Longer trips will cause greater gas consumption, and shorter trips will require less gas.
