<p dir="ltr">In this lesson, you will learn to use graphing technology to find the solution set of a linear inequality in two variables. You will also write linear inequalities to represent the constraints in situations and then use the representations (including the graphs of the solutions) to answer questions about the situations.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use graphing technology to find the solution to a two-variable inequality.</li>
<li>Connect the different representations and interpret them in terms of the situation, when given inequalities, graphs, and descriptions that represent the constraints in a situation.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
