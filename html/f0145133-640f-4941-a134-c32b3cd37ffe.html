<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<div>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
  <p>This is the first of a series of activities in which students write an inequality to represent a constraint in a situation. Students graph a related equation, interpret the coordinate pairs of points on the graph and on either side of the graph, and test the pairs of values to see if they make the inequality true. They then use these observations to determine the solution region to the inequality.</p>
  <p>Students also consider whether all the points in the solution region are necessarily meaningful or feasible in the situation. In doing so, they reason quantitatively and abstractly (MP2) and practice evaluating the reasonableness of their solutions in context (MP4).</p>
  <p>Graphing technology should not be used in this activity and the other activities in the lesson.</p>
</div>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<div>
  <p>Briefly explain to students who are unfamiliar with landscape materials what artificial turf and gravel are (or show additional pictures).</p>
  <p>Consider arranging students in groups of 2 and giving them quiet time to work on the first set of questions, followed by time to share their thinking before moving on to the rest of the activity.</p>
  <h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
  <div>
    <p><em></em>Use this routine to support reading comprehension of this problem. Use the first read to orient students to the situation. Ask students to describe what the situation is about without using numbers (a homeowner is considering alternatives to maintaining her grass lawn and flower beds). Use the second read to identify quantities and relationships. Ask students what can be counted or measured without focusing on the values (cost per square foot of artificial turf and gravel, total budget). After the third read, ask students to brainstorm possible strategies to answer the question "What combinations of turf and gravel meet the homeowner's constraints?" This helps students connect the language in the word problem and the reasoning needed to solve the problem while maintaining the cognitive demand of the task.<br><em></em></p>

<h3>Student Facing Statement</h3>
<div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>The homeowner is worried about the work needed to maintain a grass lawn and flower beds, so she is now looking at some low-maintenance materials.</p>
        <p>She is considering a combination of the materials shown to cover the yard. Her budget is still $3,000.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>artificial turf: $15 per square foot</li>
          <li>gravel: $3 per square foot</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here is a graph representing some constraints in this situation.</p>

<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<div>
  <p>Select students to share their interpretations of the two points on either side of the line. Make sure students understand that one point represents a combination of gravel and artificial turf that meets the budget constraint and that the other point does not. The region in which each point belongs can be interpreted in the same way.</p>
  <p>Also make sure students understand why points on the boundary line are included in the solution set of&nbsp;\( 3x + 15y \leq 3,\!000 \).</p>
  <p>To encourage students to evaluate the reasonableness of their solutions in terms of the situation being modeled, discuss questions such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>"Both&nbsp;\( (100,50) \)&nbsp;and&nbsp;\( (50,100) \)&nbsp;are in the solution region. Both points mean a total of 150 square feet of landscape materials. Does it make a difference which option is chosen?" (It does not make a difference in terms of the total area, but it does in terms of cost. It might also make a difference to the plants and to the overall appearance of the yard.)</li>
    <li>"All the points in the shaded region represent amounts of gravel and turf that are within the homeowner's budget. Are all these options equally good and desirable?" (Most likely not. For example, if the homeowner needs both materials, pairs such as&nbsp;\( (0,100) \)&nbsp;or&nbsp;\( (450,0) \)&nbsp;are probably not desirable because they mean buying only one material but not the other. The point&nbsp;\( (0,0) \)&nbsp;is also in the solution region, but buying no materials is probably also not an option because it would not help the homeowner with her landscaping goals.)</li>
  </ul>

<h4>Writing Inequalities to Represent Constraints</h4>
<p>Example Elena needs to earn at least $450 a week during her summer break to pay for college. She works two jobs. One as a swimming instructor that pays $9 an hour and the other as an intern in a genetics lab for $22.50 per hour. How many hours does Elena need to work at each job to earn at least $450 per week?</p>
<p>Let&nbsp;\( x \) be the number of hours she works teaching swimming and let&nbsp;\( y \) be the number of hours she works as an intern.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Write an inequality that would model this situation.</p>
<p>She earns $9 per hour at the job as a swimming instructor and $22.50 in the genetics lab. At each job the number of hours multiplied by the hourly wage will give the amount earned at that job.</p>

<h4>Writing Inequalities to Represent Constraints</h4>
<p>A baker sells pies and cakes at the bakery. Each pie sells for $14 and each cake sells for $23. Between all the sales, the baker wants to earn at least $525. How many pies and cakes does the baker need to sell to meet their goal?</p>
<p>Let&nbsp;\( p \) be the number of pies sold and let \(&nbsp;c&nbsp;\) be the number of cakes sold. Write an inequality that would model this situation.</p>
