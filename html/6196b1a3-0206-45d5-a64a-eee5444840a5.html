<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students continue to interpret statements in function notation in terms of a situation. Several things are new here, all of which provide opportunities to attend to precision and to reason quantitatively and abstractly.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The output of the function is measured in millions, so students need to attend carefully to the units or otherwise may misinterpret the situation (for example, saying that about 2 thousand people owned smartphones in 2017 rather than about 2 billion people).</li>
  <li>The input of the function is measured in &ldquo;years after 2000,&rdquo; so a positive input value \(t\) needs to be interpreted as year \(2000+t\), and the year 2010 needs to be associated with \(t=10\).</li>
  <li>One of the input values is negative, so students will need to reason about what this means in this situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students also consolidate various pieces of information about the function, given in descriptions and function notation, to sketch the graph of a function. It is possible for students to sketch many different graphs through the given points, but the context suggests that, over time, the function values are increasing roughly exponentially (though students do not need to know that term at this point).</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Read the opening sentence in the activity statement as a class. Ask students to identify the input and output of this function and the units in which each variable is measured.</p>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Give students 1&ndash;2 minutes of quiet time to read and make sense of the first two questions (without writing responses). Urge them to think about what the input and output values are in each statement (given in function notation or in words).</p>
<p>Give students another few minutes to share their thinking with their partner, and then, when reaching an agreement, to write their responses. Insist that they write their interpretations for statements such as \(P(17)=2320\) in complete sentences and use the quantity names and units. Ask students to pause for a class discussion before they continue with the rest of the activity.</p>
<p>Invite students to share their responses to the first two questions. Before students complete the remaining questions, make sure they see why:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The number of smartphone owners in the first question is not a couple of thousand people. The output is measured in millions, so a number such as 2,320 means 2,320 million or 2.32 billion people.</li>
  <li>The input value for year 2010 is not 2010. The input is measured in &ldquo;years after the year 2000,&rdquo; so the input for year 2010 is 10. An input of 2010 would mean year 4010!</li>
</ul>
<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>
<div>
  <p>Encourage and support opportunities for peer interactions. Invite students to talk about their ideas with a partner before writing them down. Display sentence frames to support students when they explain their strategy. For example, &ldquo;_____ stands for _____&rdquo;; &ldquo;What does this part of _____ mean?&rdquo;; &ldquo;What other details are important?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The function \(P\) gives the number of people, in millions, who own a smartphone, \(t\) years after the year 2000. So, any value for which \(t\) is negative would represent the number of years before 2000.</p>

  <li>Mai is curious about the value of \(t\) in \(P(t)=1000\).</li>
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
    <li>What would the value of \(t\) tell Mai about the situation?</li>
    <p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>No. \(t=4\) corresponds to the year 2004. At that time, the number of smartphone owners should be below that of 2010, which was 296 million.</p>
    <li>Is 4 a possible value of \(t\) here?</li>
    <p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>A graph goes through four points: \((-10,0)\), \((10,296.6)\), \((15,1860)\), and \((17,2320)\).</p>

<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>What can you say about the value or values of \(t\) when \(P(t)=1000\)?</p>
<h4>Extension Student Response</h4>
<p>For example: There is not enough information to know exactly when 1 billion (1,000 million) people owned a smartphone, but there is likely only one value of \(t\) when \(P(t)=1000\), and that value is somewhere between 10 and 15. This is because the number of smartphone users was less than a billion in 2010 and more than a billion in 2015.</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may struggle to express a number like 296,600,000 in millions, or they may think that a quantity like &ldquo;2,320 million&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t quite make sense. Ask them to write these quantities as numerals: 1 million, 10 million, 100 million, and so on, and then use their list to help figure out how to say 296,600,000 in millions or to write 2,320 million as a numeral.</p>
<p>Students may think they do not have enough information to sketch a graph of \(P\). Encourage them to read through the activity to identify points that must be part of the graph of \(P\), but that are not written in \((x,y)\) form.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students to share their responses and sketches of the graph of \(P\).</p>
<p>Make sure students can interpret a statement such as \(P(15)=1860\) and \(P(t)=1000\) in terms of the situation and articulate it completely. For instance, students might say, &ldquo;The output is 1,860 when the input is 15,&rdquo; or &ldquo;When the input is \(t\) years, the output is 1,000 million,&rdquo; or some other variation that doesn&rsquo;t convey the quantities fully. Push them to refine their interpretation so that it is clear that \(P(15)=1860\) means &ldquo;1.86 billion people owned a smartphone in the year 2015&rdquo; and \(P(t)=1000\) means &ldquo;A billion people owned a smartphone \(t\) years after 2000.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When discussing possible graphs of \(P\), acknowledge that a graph of \(P\) could be drawn in various ways. The information we have is limited to the four input-output pairs, so what happens between the points is up for interpretation. But it would make sense, based on the context, for the graph to show very little change before 2010 and then a rapid increase afterward.</p>
<p>If possible, draw students&rsquo; attention to the idea that modeling a relationship with a function involves making choices about the units used. Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;The output of \(P\) is defined in terms of &lsquo;millions of people&rsquo; instead of individual persons. What might be the reason for this?&rdquo; (If the unit is &ldquo;persons,&rdquo; the scale would show very long numbers with 9 or 10 digits each, which would be much harder to read and might lead to mistakes. Using &ldquo;in thousands&rdquo; or &ldquo;in millions&rdquo; strategically makes it possible to use simpler numbers. It makes it easier to draw attention to important characteristics of a graph.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;The input is defined in &lsquo;years after 2000.&rsquo; Could we have used calendar years instead, such as 2002?&rdquo; (Yes)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;What might be a reason to choose &lsquo;years after 2000&rsquo; as the unit?&rdquo; (It allows us to write smaller numbers. Another reason is that sometimes knowing a duration is more useful than knowing a particular point in time at which something happens. For instance, in the drone activity, knowing the number of seconds that had passed before the drone landed was more useful than knowing that it landed at, say, 2:45 p.m. In this activity, the year 2000 might be significant in the development of smartphones, so measuring time with that starting point might be useful.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.3.2: Additional Resources</h3>
<p><strong><em>The following content is available to students who would like more support based on their experience with the self check. Students will not automatically have access to this content, so you may wish to share it with those who could benefit from it.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<h4>Interpreting Equations in Function Notation</h4>
<p>What does a statement like \(p(x)=12\) mean?</p>
<p>We can interpret statements like \(p(x)=32\) to mean "a square with side length x has a perimeter of 32 inches"</p>
<p>If we know what quantities the input and output represent, however, we can learn much more about the situation that the function represents.</p>
<p>If function \(p\) gives the perimeter of a square whose side length is \(x\) and both measurements are in inches, then we can interpret \(p(3)=12\) to mean &ldquo;a square whose side length is 3 inches has a perimeter of 12 inches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We can also interpret statements like \(p(x)=32\) to mean &ldquo;a square with side length \(x\) has a perimeter of 32 inches,&rdquo; which then allows us to reason that \(x\) must be 8 inches and to write \(p(8)=32\).</p>
<p>If function \(p\) gives the number of blog subscribers, in thousands, \(x\) months after a blogger started publishing online, then \(p(3)=1200\) means &ldquo;3 months after a blogger started publishing online, the blog has 12,000 subscribers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is important to pay attention to the units of measurement when analyzing a function. Otherwise, we might mistake what is happening in the situation. If we miss that \(p(x)\) is measured in thousands, we might misinterpret \(p(36)\) to mean &ldquo;there are 36 blog subscribers after \(x\) months,&rdquo; while it actually means &ldquo;after 36 months, there are \(x\) thousands of blog subscribers.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Try It: Interpret Equations in Function Notation</h4>
<p>If a function \(A\) gives the area of a square with side length \(x\) centimeters, then what does the function \(A(8)=64\) mean?</p>
<p>Write down your answer. Then select the <strong>solution </strong>button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to interpret the function notation in the equation:</p>
<p>Since \(A\) gives the area and 8 is the input, a square with side length of 8 centimeters has an area of 64 \(cm^2\).</p>
