<h4>Determine Solutions of Systems of Inequalities on Boundary Lines</h4>
<p>A solution to a system of inequalities only exists on a boundary line if the line is solid, not dashed.</p>

<p>Solve the system by graphing:&nbsp;</p>
<p>\(\left\{\begin{array}{l}x-y&gt;3\\y&lt;-\frac15x+4.\end{array}\right.\)</p>

<p>The point of intersection of the two lines is not included because both boundary lines were dashed. The solution is the area shaded twice&mdash;which appears as the darkest shaded region.</p>
<p>Notice that the point \((0,-3)\) is NOT a solution because it falls on the red dashed line.<br>The point \((4, -2)\) IS a solution because it is included in the solutions to both inequalities.<br></p>

  <p> Here is how to determine if the coordinates are solutions:</p>
  <p>Remember that when a coordinate is on a boundary line, it must be solid if it is a solution. The coordinate must also be in the overlapping shaded regions to be a solution to the entire system.</p>
  <p>The answers are \((2, 1)\) and \((3, -1)\)</p>
