<h4>Draw a Best-Fit Line for the Plotted Data</h4>
<p>When looking to draw a line of best fit, first make sure a linear model works for the data.</p>
<p>Next, place the line between the data points so that about the same number of points are above and below the line.
  The aim is to also have points within a close distance to the line of best fit.</p>
<p><span>Below are two examples of lines of best fit drawn through scatter plots.</span><br/></p>

<p>Pattiâ€™s line looks like it fits the data well, so it would probably produce good predictions. The line goes
      through the middle of the points in the scatter plot, with a similar number of points above and below the line
      that are not a far distance from the line of best fit.</p>
