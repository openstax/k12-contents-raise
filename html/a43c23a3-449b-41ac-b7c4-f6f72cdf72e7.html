<h4>Writing Quadratic Equations from Graphs</h4>
<p>Write an equation for the graph below:</p>
<p><img alt="GRAPH OF A PARABOLA THAT OPENS UPWARD WITH A Y-INTERCEPT OF NEGATIVE 8 AND X-INTERCEPTS OF NEGATIVE 2 AND 4." height="349" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c055716b4854e25b101b61523b81193fa53c6497" width="300"></p>
<p>First, locate the \(x\)-intercepts at \((-2,0)\) and \((4,0)\).<br>
  Next, write the factor for each \(x\)-intercept.</p>
<p>The factors that result in the given zeros are \((x + 2)\) and \((x - 4)\).<br>
  The equation for this quadratic function is \(f(x)=(x + 2)(x - 4)\).</p>

<p>Here is how to write an equation for the function graphed:</p>
<p>First, identify the \(x\)-intercepts: \(x = -6\), \(x = 2.\)<br>
    Next, write a factor for each zero:<br>
    \((x + 6)\) and \((x - 2)\)</p>
<p>The function in factored form is \(f(x)=(x + 6)(x - 2)\).</p>
