<p>In this unit, you will learn about exponential functions and models. Understanding exponential functions and models can help you with financial planning, whether you want to know how much interest you will pay on a credit card balance, how much interest you will earn on your savings account, or how much a stock fund has grown in value over the past 10 years.</p>
<h4>Building Character: Grit </h4>
<p>Through coaching, John Hope Bryan, owner of Operation Hope, equips young people and adults with the &filig;nancial tools and education to secure a better future. He coaches them through their personal aspirations and life&rsquo;s challenges and facilitates their journey to &filig;nancial independence. Similarly, you will need to present passion and perseverance to work through this course to ultimately achieve your long-term goals, just as John&rsquo;s organization helps others achieve their long-term financial goals. This unit is the midpoint of the course. Through grit, you will be able to keep working toward your goal, and you will uncover that exponential functions and models can help with long-term planning. </p>
<p>Throughout this unit, you will work on developing your grit. Grit is passion and perseverance to reach long-term goals. Excellence sometimes seems like the result of natural talent. But no matter how gifted you are&mdash;no matter how easily you climb up the learning curve&mdash;you do need to do that climbing. There are no shortcuts. Grit predicts accomplishing challenging goals of personal significance. For example, grittier students are more likely to graduate from high school, and grittier cadets are more likely to complete their training at West Point. Notably, in most research studies, grit and measures of talent and IQ are unrelated, suggesting that talent puts no limits on the capacity for passion and perseverance.</p>

</ul>
