<h4>Optional Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>The activities in this lesson are an extension of the TEKS expectations.</p>
<p>This activity offers an additional opportunity for writing a linear inequality in two variables to represent constraints and for graphing and interpreting the solutions.</p>
<p>In previous activities, the solution region of an inequality \( Ax + By \leq C \) lies below a boundary line and the solution region of an inequality \( Ax + By \geq C \) lies above a boundary line. In this activity, students encounter an example in which the symbol \( \geq \) does not correspond to a solution region above the boundary line. (In the given situation, pairs of values that generate more revenue for the concert are points below the graph of \( Ax+By=C \).)</p>
<p>The work here reinforces the importance of reasoning about points on either side of a boundary line, rather than simply assuming that &lt; or \( \leq \) means shading below the line and &gt; or \( \geq \) means shading above the line. </p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange (or keep) students in groups of 2. Give students a few minutes of quiet time to work on the first two questions, as they mirror previous activities. Allow time to discuss their responses before they focus on the last two questions.<br>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>For questions 1-6, use the following scenario:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A popular band is trying to raise at least $20,000 for charity by holding multiple concerts at a park. It plans to sell tickets at $25 each. For each 2-hour concert, the band would need to pay the park $1,250 in fees for security, cleaning, and traffic services.</p>
<p>The band needs to find the combinations of number of tickets sold, \( t \), and number of concerts held, \( c \), that would allow it to reach its fundraising goal.</p></blockquote>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Write an inequality to represent the constraints in this situation.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( 25t - 1,250c \geq 20,000 \)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li> Use the graphing tool or technology outside the course. Graph your inequality from question 1 that represents this scenario using the Desmos tool below.  Students were provided access to Desmos. </li> 
</ol><br>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>

<br>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Name two possible combinations of number of tickets sold and number of concerts held that would allow the band to meet its goal.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li>\( (1000, 2) \)</li>
  <li>\( (1400, 5) \)</li>
</ul>
<p>For questions 4â€“6, decide which combination of tickets and concerts would mean more money for charity:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>1,300 tickets and 10 concerts, or 1,300 tickets and 5 concerts?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 1,300 tickets and 5 concerts</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>1,600 tickets and 16 concerts, or 1,200 tickets and 9 concerts?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 1,600 tickets and 16 concerts.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
  <li>2,000 tickets and 4 concerts, or 2,500 tickets and 10 concerts?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 2,500 tickets and 10 concerts</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may find it challenging to graph the boundary line (\( 25t -1,\!250c = 20,\!000 \)) by identifying the intercepts. The horizontal intercept is fairly easy to find, but the graph intersects the vertical axis at a negative value (and a negative number of concerts does not make sense in this situation). Ask students to find at least one other point (besides the vertical intercept) that is a solution to the equation.</p>
<p>Students who rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form and find the slope to be 0.02 may also find it difficult to interpret. Ask them to try writing the slope as a fraction (\( \frac{2}{100} \)).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their inequality and the graph of the solution region.</p>
<p>Focus the discussion on the last two questions-on how students knew which combinations of tickets and concerts would enable the band to meet its goal and would raise more money. Highlight responses that involve testing pairs of values to see if they satisfy the inequality or to make comparisons.</p>
<p>If not mentioned in students' explanations, point out that even though the inequality has a \( \geq \) symbol, the solution region is below the boundary line, not above it. Stress the importance of not blindly shading a region based on the symbol in the inequality.</p>
