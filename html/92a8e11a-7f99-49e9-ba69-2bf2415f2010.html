<h4>Rewriting Quadratic Expressions in Standard Form</h4>
<p>We have had a lot of practice rewriting factored form into standard form. To reverse this process, many of the same skills are needed.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Write \(x^2+16x +63\) in factored form.</p>
<p>To do this, we must think about how you converted from factored form into standard form. First, check if the leading coefficient (for the quadratic term) is 1. If so, then:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> To find the coefficient of the middle term, 16, we added two numbers together from the diagram. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> To find the last term or constant, 63, we multiplied two numbers together from the diagram. </li>
</ul>
<p>So, which numbers, \(a\) and \(b\), have a sum of 16 and a product of 63?</p>
<p><img alt=" DIAGRAM THAT SHOWS A PLUS B AND A TIMES B WITH ARROWS GOING TO 16 AND 63 IN THE QUADRATIC EXPRESSION, X-SQUARED PLUS 16X PLUS 63." height="147" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/864bde4e5cff9d5f8e6acdf306622f0e768223e7" width="200"></p>
<p>The positive factors of 63 include:</p>
<p>1, 63<br>
  3, 21<br>
  7, 9</p>
<p>With some reasoning, we find that 7 and 9 are the numbers we want.</p>
<p>So, the factored form of \(x^2+16x +63\) is \((x + 7)(x + 9)\).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at another example.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Write \(x^2&minus;10x +16\) in factored form.</p>
<p>The sign of the middle term is negative, but we follow the same process since the coefficient of \(x^2\) is 1.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s rewrite the expression as \(x^2+ -10x +16\).</p>
<p>Which numbers have a sum of &ndash;10 and a product of 16?</p>
<p>The factors of 16 include:</p>
<p>1, 16<br>&ndash;1, &ndash;16<br>
  2, 8<br>&ndash;2, &ndash;8<br>
  4, 4<br>&ndash;4, &ndash;4</p>
<p>The numbers we need are &ndash;2 and &ndash;8 because they have a product of 16 and a sum of &ndash;10.</p>
<p>So, the factored form is \((x + (-2))(x + (-8))\). This can be rewritten as \((x &minus; 2)(x &minus; 8)\).</p>
