<h4> Trends in Average Rates of Change</h4>
<p>A construction company purchased some equipment costing $300,000. The equipment depreciates in value over time.</p>

<p>Approximately how much did the value drop from years 0 to 5 compared to years 6 to 10?</p>
<p>\(\frac{v(5)-v(0)}{5-0} \approx \frac{140,000-300,000}{5}=-32,000\)</p>
<p>\(\frac{v(10)-v(6)}{10-6} \approx \frac{70,000-120,000}{4}=-12,500\)</p>
<p>Following this trend, we would expect the average rate of change of the value of the equipment from years 11&ndash;15 to be below &ndash;12,500 dollars per year.</p>
