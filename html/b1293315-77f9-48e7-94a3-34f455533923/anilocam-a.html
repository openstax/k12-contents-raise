<p>In this lesson, you will investigate different ways to find the solution set to an inequality&mdash;by reasoning about the quantities and relationships in context; by guessing some values, substituting them into the inequality, and checking them to see if you make the inequality true; and by first solving a related equation in one variable. </p>

<p>Below are the knowledge and skills you will practice in this lesson. Before you begin, read each one and rate how much you currently know about each one. It&rsquo;s okay if your ratings are low; the purpose of this is to check in with yourself about what you do or do not yet know.</p>
<p><strong>Can you...</strong></p>
