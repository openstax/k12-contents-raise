<p>To help students&rsquo; understanding of key points from the lesson, pose the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li> What is unique about the first and last terms in a perfect square trinomial? (They are perfect squares.) </li>
<li> What is the pattern of the middle term in a perfect square trinomial? \((\pm2ab)\) </li>
<li> To what binomial does the trinomial \(a^2 &minus; 2ab + b^2\) factor? \([ (a &minus; b)^2 ]\) </li>
<li> What do you call the binomials \((a &minus; b)\) and \((a + b)\)? (conjugate pair) </li>
<li> What is the pattern used to factor a difference of squares? \([ a^2 &minus; b^2 = (a &minus; b)(a + b) ]\) </li>
<li><span>Can you factor \(a^2 + b^2\)? (No, it is prime.)</span><br></li>
</ul>
