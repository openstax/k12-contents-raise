<p>To help students&rsquo; understanding of key points from the lesson, pose the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li> What is unique about the first and last terms in a perfect square trinomial? (They are perfect squares.) </li>
  <li> What is the pattern of the middle term in a perfect square trinomial? \((\pm2ab)\) </li>
  <li> To what binomial does the trinomial \(a^2 &minus; 2ab + b^2\) factor? \([ (a &minus; b)^2 ]\) </li>
  <li> What do you call the binomials \((a &minus; b)\) and \((a + b)\)? (conjugate pair) </li>
  <li> What is the pattern used to factor a difference of squares? \([ a^2 &minus; b^2 = (a &minus; b)(a + b) ]\) </li>
  <li><span>Can you factor \(a^2 + b^2\)? (No, it is prime.)</span><br></li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
