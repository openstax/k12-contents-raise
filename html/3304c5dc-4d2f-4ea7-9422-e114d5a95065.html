<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity introduces students to polynomial functions. Students will learn that evaluating a polynomial function for a given value is similar to how they have evaluated other functions in previous lessons.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Allow students to work through the problems individually. Have students work on the first 3 problems and pause the class for questions before students move on to subsequent questions.</p>
<p>Then, arrange students in groups of 2. Provide access to calculators. Instruct one partner in each pair to write their own polynomial function. Have the other partner generate three values between &ndash;10 and 10. Partners should exchange their values and functions. Each member should evaluate the polynomial function for each of the values given. Students should compare solutions and discuss any differences.</p>

    <!--Support Content-->As students are sharing their polynomial functions in groups of two, students should take turns describing what steps they think should be taken next to find the solutions and explaining the reasoning behind those steps. Display the following sentence frames for all to see: “We should do ____ next because . . .”, and “I noticed ___ , so I think . . . .” Encourage students to challenge each other when they disagree. This will help students clarify their reasoning when solving polynomial equations.  When students are discussing what is the same and different about their steps and solving strategies, assist students in using negatives and contractions correctly, such as do/don't, can/can't, is/isn't.

<p>Arrange into pairs. One partner should write their own polynomial function similar to the ones in this activity. The other partner should select 3 different values between &ndash;10 and 10. Exchange your function and values with your partner. Each member should evaluate the polynomial function for the given values. When finished, compare your answers. Did you find the same solutions? Discuss any differences you found.</p>
<h4> Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Since students have worked with functions in previous lessons, much of this activity will be familiar to them. Emphasize that polynomial functions often behave in the same way as other functions students have studied. Tell students that in the next activity, we will work on adding and subtracting polynomial functions in the same way we learned to add and subtract polynomials.</p>

<h3>6.1.3: Additional Resources</h3>
<p><strong><em>The following content is available to students who would like more support based on their experience with the self check. Students will not automatically have access to this content, so you may wish to share it with those who could benefit from it.</em></strong></p>
<h4> Evaluating a Polynomial Function for a Given Value</h4>
<p>A polynomial function is a function whose range values are defined by a polynomial. For example, \(f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 6\) and \(g(x) = 3x-4\) are polynomial functions because \(x^2 + 5x + 6\) and \(3x - 4\) are polynomials.</p>
<p>To evaluate a polynomial function, we will substitute the given value for the variable and then simplify using the order of operations.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some examples.</p>
<p>For the function \(f(x) = 5x^2 - 8x + 4\), find:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="1">
  <li>\( f(4)\) </li>
  <li> \(f(-2)\) </li>
  <li> \(f(0)\) </li>
</ol>
<p>The following is a step-by-step breakdown.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>\(f(4)=5x^2-8x+4\)</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 1<br>
  To find \(f(4)\), substitute \({\style{color:red}4}\) for \(x\). <br>
  \(f({\style{color:red}4})=5({\style{color:red}4})^2-8({\style{color:red}4})+4\) </p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Simplify the exponents.<br>
  \(f(4)=5 \cdot 16-8(4)+4\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Multiply.<br>
  \(f(4)=80-32+4\)</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  Simplify.<br>
  \(f(4)=52\)</p>
<br>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>\(f(-2)=5x^2-8x+4\)</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 1<br>
  To find \(f(-2)\), substitute \({\style{color:red}-}{\style{color:red}2}\) for \(x\).<br>
  \(f({\style{color:red}-}{\style{color:red}2})=5({\style{color:red}-}{\style{color:red}2})^2-8({\style{color:red}-}{\style{color:red}2})+4\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Simplify the exponents.<br>
  \(f(-2)=5 \cdot 4-8(-2)+4\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Multiply.<br>
  \(f(-2)=20+15+4\)</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  Simplify.<br>
  \(f(-2)=40\)</p>
<br>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>\(f(0)=5x^2-8x+4\)</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 1<br>
  To find \(f(0)\), substitute \({\style{color:red}0}\) for \(x\). <br>
  \(f({\style{color:red}0})=5({\style{color:red}0})^2-8({\style{color:red}0})+4\) </p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Simplify the exponents.<br>
  \(f(0)=5 \cdot 0-8(0)+4\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Multiply.<br>
  \(f(0)=0+0+4\)</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  Simplify.<br>
  \(f(0)=4\)</p>
<br>
<h4> Try It: Evaluating a Polynomial Function for a Given Value</h4>

<h5> Solution</h5>
<p><span>Here is how to evaluate the polynomial function:</span><br></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>\( f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 15 \)<br>
    \(f(3) = 3(3)^2 + 2(3) - 15\)<br>

    \(f(3) = 18\)</li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>\( f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 15\)<br>
    \(f(-5) = 3(-5)^2 + 2(-5) - 15\)<br>
    \(f(-5) = 3(25) - 10 - 15\)<br>
    \(f(-5) = 50\)</li>

  <li>\( f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 15\)<br>
    \(
    f(0) = 3(0)^2 + 2(0) - 15\)<br>
    \(
    f(0) = -15\)</li>
