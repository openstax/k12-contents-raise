<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Solve for a particular variable, given an equation.</li>
  <li>Determine the more useful form of an equation.</li>
  <li>Explain the phrase &ldquo;to solve for a variable.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1.8.1: Expressing Relationships Between Two Quantities
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you completed a table by using the relationship between the values already in the table.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1.8.2: Identifying the Most Useful Form of an Equation
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you worked to recognize the most useful form of an equation. You also wrote an equation in the most useful form that would be needed to find specific information.</li>
  </li>
  <li>1.8.2: Self Check</li>
  <li>1.8.2: Additional Resources</li>
    </ul>
  <li>1.8.3: Writing Equations and Isolating Variables
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you used equations to solve for specific variables that helped answer questions about given situations.</li>
