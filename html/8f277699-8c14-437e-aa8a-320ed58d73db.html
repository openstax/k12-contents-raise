<h4>Activity (18 Minutes)</h4>
<p>Students wrote the equation of a line in slope-intercept form given the slope and the \( y \)-intercept. In this
  lesson, students will find the equation of a line given the slope and a point that is not the \( y \)-intercept.
  Point-slope form is new to students. Deriving the formula from the formula for slope can help students see that there
  is a connection to the slope, which they already know how to find. Allow students to use a graphing calculator or
  Desmos where appropriate to check their answers. Point out to students that most graphing calculators require the
equations to be in slope-intercept form to graph them. </p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Have students work in pairs. When deriving the formula, watch that students do not distribute \( m \) to the \(
  x \)-variables. While students are working, check to see that they are substituting the correct values into the
  equation. Remind students they can graph a line given a point and the slope by plotting the given point and using the
  rise over run to find another point. Remind them the rise is the change in \(y\) and the run is the change in \( x \).
For example, a slope of 3 can be written as \( \frac{3}{1} \): the rise is 3, and the run is 1. </p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>What if the point you are given isn&rsquo;t a \( y \)-intercept? Point-slope is a great form to use when
you are given the slope and any point. </p>
<p>First, work to derive the point-slope formula by completing the following steps:</p>
<p>Start with the slope formula as \( m= \frac{y-y_1}{x-x_1} \).</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> Multiply both sides of the equation by \( x - x_1 \).</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br> \( m(x-x_1)=\left(\frac{y-y_1}{x-x_1}\right)(x-x_1) \)</p> 
<p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Simplify.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br> \( m(x-x_1)=y-y_1 \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 -</strong> Rewrite the equation with the \(y\) terms on the left.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br> \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \)</p>
<p>With your partner, you will find the equation of the line in point-slope form that goes through the point \( (3, 4)
  \) and has a slope of 2 by answering the following questions.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Students may get a little confused because \(x\) and \(y\) appear twice in the formula. Point out that the \(x\) and
  \(y\) with the subscript indicate the \(x\) and \(y\) values that are given to you. The \(x\) and \(y\) with the
  subscript are replaced by the known values in the given point. Point out to students that writing the equation in the
  slope-intercept form allows them to graph the equation using a graphing calculator.</p>

<h4>Write the Equation of a Line Given the Slope and a Point</h4>
<p>Writing an equation using the slope-intercept form works well when you are given the slope and
  \(y\)-intercept. If you are given the slope and another point that is not the \(y\)-intercept, we need another form of
  the equation of a line. </p>
 <p>The point-slope form of an equation of a line can be derived from the formula for slope. Suppose
    you have a line that has slope \(m\) and that contains some specific point \( (x_1, y_1) \) as point 1 and some
    other point, \( (x, y) \), as point 2. You can write the slope of this line and then change it to a different
    form.</p>
 <p>The point-slope form of an equation of a line with slope \(m\) and containing the point \( (x_1, y_1)
  \) is: \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \). You can use this form to find the equation of a line when you are given the slope
  and a point.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1 </strong></p>
 <p>Write the equation of a line with slope \( m = -\frac{1}{3} \) that contains the point \( (6, -4) \).
  Write the equation in slope-intercept form and standard form. </p>
 <p><strong>Step 1 - </strong> Identify the slope. <br>
 The slope is given.<br>
 \( m = \frac{1}{3} \)</p>
 <p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Identify the point.<br>
 The point is given.<br>
 \( (x_1, y_1) \)<br>
 \( (6, -4) \)</p>
 <p><strong>Step 3 - </strong>Substitute the values into the point-slope form, \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \).
 Simplify.<br>
 \(\begin{array}{rcl}y-y_1&amp;=&amp;m(x-x_1)\\y-(-4)&amp;=&amp;\frac13(x-6)\\y+4&amp;=&amp;\frac13x+2\end{array}\)</p>
 <p><strong>Step 4 - </strong> Write the equation in slope-intercept form.<br>
 \( y = \frac{1}{3}x -2 \)</p>
 <p><strong>Step 5 -</strong> Convert slope-intercept form to standard form. <br>
  \(y=\frac13x−2\)<br>
  \(3y=3\frac13x−(3)2\)<br>
  \(3y=x−6\)<br>
  \(-x+3y=−6\)<br>
  \((-1)(-x+3y=−6\))<br>
   \(x-3y=6\)</p>
<p>To find an equation of a line given the slope and a point, follow these steps:</p>
<br>
<div class="os-raise-graybox">
<p><strong>Step 1 - </strong>Identify the slope.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3 - </strong> Substitute the values into the point-slope form, \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \).</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 - </strong> Write the equation in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 -</strong> Convert slope-intercept form to standard form. </p>
</div>
<br>
<p><strong>Example 2 </strong></p>
<p>Find the equation of a horizontal line that contains the point \( (&ndash;2, &ndash;6)
    \). Write the equation in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 - </strong> Identify the slope. Every horizontal line has slope 0.<br>
\( m = 0 \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Identify the point.<br>
\( (x_1, y_1) \)<br>
\( (&ndash;2, &ndash;6) \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 - </strong>Substitute the values into the point-slope form, \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \).
Simplify.<br>
\(\begin{array}{rcl}y-y_1&amp;=&amp;m(x-x_1)\\y-(-6)&amp;=&amp;0(x-(-2))\\y+6&amp;=&amp;0\end{array}\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 - </strong> Write the equation in slope-intercept form.<br>
\( y = -6 \)<br>
\( y = 0x - 6 \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 -</strong> Convert slope-intercept form to standard form. <br>
\(y=0x−6\)<br>
\(0x+y=−6\)</p>
