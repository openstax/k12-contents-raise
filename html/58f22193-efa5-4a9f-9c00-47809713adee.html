<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>Having just seen an example of the meaning of \(a\) and \(b\)&nbsp;in an exponential expression \(a\cdot b^x\), students now focus on interpreting these numbers using graphs. They graph the equations from the previous task, noticing that \(a\)&nbsp;is the vertical intercept of the graph and the number \(b\) determines how quickly the graph grows (since in these cases \(b &gt; 1\)). A larger value of \(b\)&nbsp;corresponds to a more rapid rate of growth for the bacteria population. The axes for the graphs have been labeled here, but in future activities, students will have to think strategically about how to label the axes to most effectively plot the points.</p>
<p>Making graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Display the equations from the previous activity for all to see (if they are not already visible).</p>
<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<div>
<p>Use this routine to help students describe the meaning of variables in exponential expressions. Arrange students in groups of 2. Invite Partner A to share their observations for the first graph and Partner B to share their observations for the second graph. Provide sentence frames such as: &ldquo;I can connect the equation to the graph by . . .&rdquo; and &ldquo;I notice that . . . .&rdquo; Invite the listener to press for additional details referring to features of the graphs, such as the vertical intercept, specific points, and the steepness of the curve. This will help students justify how features of the graph can be used to identify matching equations.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>In an exponential function, the output is multiplied by the same factor every time the input increases by one. The multiplier is called the growth factor.</p>
<ol>
<li> Refer back to your work in the table in activity 5.4.3: Exponential Change: The Growth Factor, where \(n=500\cdot2^t\) and \(p=100\cdot3^t\). Use that information and the given coordinate planes to graph the following by writing down your answer in your notebook. Then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to check your work.

</li>
<br>
<li> On the graph of \(n\), where can you see each number that appears in the equation? <br><br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> 500 is the vertical intercept (or the value of \(n\) when \(t\) is 0). The 2 is the doubling of the \(n\)-value every time \(t\) increases by 1.
            </li>
<br>
<li> On the graph of \(p\), where can you see each number that appears in the equation? <br><br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> 100 is the vertical intercept (or the value of \(p\) when \(t\) is 0). The 3 is the tripling of the \(p\)-value every time \(t\) increases by 1.
            </li>
</ol>

</ol>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may have trouble graphing the points, particularly finding the appropriate vertical (\(n\) or \(p\)) values. Ask them to find the coordinates of the grid points on the vertical axis and use that to estimate the vertical position of their points.</p>
<p>When calculating values by hand, many students may mistakenly write an expression like \(100\cdot3^2\) as \(300^2\). Remind them that the expression \(100\cdot3^2\) means \(100\cdot3\cdot3\).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Make sure students recognize two key takeaways from this activity:</p>
<p>The vertical intercept of the graph is the initial bacteria population size. It is the size of the population when first measured, or when \(t\), the number of hours since measurement, is 0.</p>
<p>The growth factor of the populations is represented by how quickly the graph increases.</p>

<p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: \((1, 6)\) is a point on this graph. However, the graph you are looking for has a \(y\)-intercept of 2, not 1. This is the graph of \(y=6^x\). When graphing, remember that the \(a\)-value from \(y=a\cdot b^x\) is also the \(y\)-intercept. The answer is <img alt="GRAPH OF AN EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION WITH Y-INTERCEPT OF 2 AND PASSING THROUGH THE POINT (1, 6)." height="257" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/0a3375b97db850062aa6bc6d152d3d7bcf64b6b5" width="256"></p>

<p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: The points \((1, 6)\) and \((0, 2)\) are on the graph. However, this is the graph of a linear function, \(y=4x+2\), not an exponential function. When graphing an exponential function, remember it has a constant ratio. The answer is<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s correct! Check yourself: Since the \(a\)-value of the equation is 2, that is also the \(y\)-intercept. When \(x=1\), you have \(y=2\cdot 3^1\) or \(y=2\cdot 3\), which is \(y=6\).</p>

<h4>Graphing Exponential Functions</h4>
<p>Graph \(y=4^x\).</p>
<p>When graphing any function, it often helps to start with a table. The table should always contain a minimum of 3 to 5 entries. The more information you have, the easier it is to sketch the graph. The information below is generic and applies to the graph of most exponential growth functions.</p>

<p>This information can be used to create a graph and connect the points with a smooth curve.</p>

<p>Once a table of values is created, plot each of the points on a coordinate plane, remembering that exponential functions are more of a smooth curve. It is possible that your points don&rsquo;t fit on the graph you have created, but they can be useful to &ldquo;see&rdquo; your graph continue off the coordinate plane.</p>
