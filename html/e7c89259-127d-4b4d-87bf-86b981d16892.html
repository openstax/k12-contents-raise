<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In an earlier unit, students compared linear and exponential growth and observed that exponential growth eventually
  overtakes linear growth (even if a quantity showing linear growth starts out with a much greater value). They examined
  this phenomenon and then observed that it will always happen at a large enough input value.</p>
<p>In this lesson, students investigate how quantities that grow quadratically compare to those that grow exponentially.
  They discover and reason that increasing exponential functions also eventually surpass increasing quadratic functions.
  By examining successive quotients for each type of function, students see that the outputs of quadratic functions are
  not multiplied by the same factor each time the input increases by one. In fact, these successive quotients get
  smaller as the inputs increase, while the outputs of the exponential function have the same multiplier. As they
  compare the two types of functions, they develop their understanding of quadratic expressions and how the shape of the
  graph differs between the two types of functions.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Use graphs, tables, and calculations to show that exponential functions eventually overtake quadratic functions.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Explain using graphs, tables, or calculations how exponential functions eventually grow faster than quadratic
    functions.
  </li>
</ul>

    <p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are
  only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.
  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines. </p>
<ul>
  <li>ELPS 1(C) use strategic learning techniques such as concept mapping, drawing, memorizing, comparing, contrasting, and
    reviewing to acquire basic and grade-level vocabulary</li>
  <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and
    reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
  <li>ELPS 3(B) expand and internalize initial English vocabulary by learning and using high-frequency English words
    necessary for identifying and describing people, places, and objects, by retelling simple stories and basic
    information represented or supported by pictures, and by learning and using routine language needed for classroom
    communication</li>
  <li>ELPS 3(D) speak using grade-level content area vocabulary in context to internalize new English words and build
    academic language proficiency</li>
  <li>ELPS 3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions</li>
  <li>ELPS 3(F) ask and give information ranging from using a very limited bank of high-frequency, high-need, concrete
    vocabulary, including key words and expressions needed for basic communication in academic and social contexts, to
    using abstract and content-based vocabulary during extended speaking assignments</li>
  <li>ELPS 3(H) narrate, describe, and explain with increasing specificity and detail as more English is acquired</li>
