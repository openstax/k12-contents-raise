<p>To help students summarize and generalize the reasoning involved in rewriting quadratic expressions from standard form to factored form, display a few expressions such as these:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> \(x^2+8x +15\) </li>
<li> \(x^2+11x+ 28\) </li>
<li> \(x^2 +bx + c\) </li>
</ul>
<p>For each one, ask students to explain the process of transforming it into factored form by completing (in writing or by talking a partner) sentence starters such as these:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> To find the factors, I first try to find . . . </li>
<li> Next, I think about . . . </li>
<li> The equivalent expression in factored form is . . . </li>
<li> To check that the factors are correct, I can . . . </li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure students see that for \(x^2+bx + c\), a helpful process goes something like this:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> First, we find all pairs of factors of \(c\). </li>
<li> Next, find a pair of factors of \(c\) that add up to equal \(b\). (If the factors are \(m\) and \(n\), then we want \(m+n =b\).) </li>
<li> The factors will be \((x + m)(x + n)\). </li>
<li> We can check by expanding the factored form (by applying the distributive property) and see if we get the original expression as a result. </li>
</ul>
