<p>In this lesson, you will work to find the slope of a line from two points, a graph, and a table. You will then use this knowledge to write equations of lines in three different forms: slope-intercept form, point-slope form, and standard form.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Write the slope of a line. </li>
  <li> Write the equation of a line in different forms. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
