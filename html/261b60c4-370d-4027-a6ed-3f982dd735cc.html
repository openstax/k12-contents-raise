<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>Clare noticed mold on the last slice of bread in a plastic bag. The area covered by the mold was about 1 square millimeter. She left the bread alone to see how the mold would grow. The next day, the area covered by the mold had doubled, and it doubled again the day after that.</p>

      <li>The number of days that have passed is a function of the area covered by the mold up to a certain point (e.g., when the entire piece of bread is already completely covered, the area of mold would correspond to more than one day).

    <p>Your answer may vary, but here is an example.<br>Some negative values of \(t\) could be relevant, but we don&rsquo;t know how the mold was growing before Clare started watching. Positive values of \(t\) will not be valid indefinitely as the bread will soon be completely covered by mold. If a piece of bread is 10 cm by 10 cm, that&rsquo;s 10,000 square mm. An appropriate domain would be \(0 \leq d \leq 14\).</p>
