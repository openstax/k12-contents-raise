<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>Clare noticed mold on the last slice of bread in a plastic bag. The area covered by the mold was about 1 square
  millimeter. She left the bread alone to see how the mold would grow. The next day, the area covered by the mold had
  doubled, and it doubled again the day after that.</p>

      <li>The area covered by mold is a function of the number of days that have passed. At any given time since mold
        was spotted, there is a certain area of the bread that is covered in mold.</li>
      <li>The number of days that have passed is a function of the area covered by the mold up to a certain point (e.g.,
        when the entire piece of bread is already completely covered, the area of mold would correspond to more than one
        day). We do not have a way to write this relationship using an equation, but we could use a table or a graph to
        show the relationship.</li>

    <p>Your answer may vary, but here is an example.<br>Some negative values of \(t\) could be relevant, but we
      don&rsquo;t know how the mold was growing before Clare started watching. Positive values of \(t\) will not be
      valid indefinitely as the bread will soon be completely covered by mold. If a piece of bread is 10 cm by 10 cm,
      that&rsquo;s 10,000 square mm. An appropriate domain would be \(0 \leq d \leq 14\).</p>
