<h4>Activity (20 Minutes)</h4>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in pairs or groups, if necessary, so they have access to Desmos. If possible, allow students to work individually so that each understands the steps necessary to find the correlation coefficient of a data set.</p>
<p>After students open a window to Desmos, instruct them to click into each cell in the table and insert each corresponding value in the data set. Once a student has clicked into the first cell in the table, they may also use the arrow keys to navigate from one cell to the next. </p>
<p>Instructions are provided if they wish to copy and paste the entire table, but emphasize that unless the values are copied from a spreadsheet, they will not be pasted together into the table.</p>
<p>Show students that the graphing window, or field of view, may be changed by clicking onto the graph and dragging it in different directions.</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
<li> What does this number tell you about the strength of the linear relationship? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> These data have a strong negative linear relationship. This means that as the \(x\)-values increase, the \(y\)-values decrease.</p>
<br/>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>If students are having difficulty finding the correlation coefficient using technology, tell them to use the \(corr(x_1, y_1\)) command in Desmos. It may also be helpful to check the accuracy of the data entered into the \(x_1\) and \(y_1\)columns.</p>
<p>Tell students, in this lesson, we will find the correlation coefficient of a data set using technology. We will then use the correlation coefficient to understand the strength of a linear relationship.</p>

<h4>Finding The Correlation Coefficient Using Technology</h4>
<p>(Students were provided access to Desmos.)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Use the Desmos graphing tool below to create a table for entering this data.  Click on the “+” symbol and select the table from the drop-down menu.</p>
<br/>
<div class="os-raise-ib-desmos-gc" data-schema-version="1.0"></div>
<br/>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Enter the data into the corresponding x1 and y1 columns in the table you created in Step 1.  Press Enter or use arrow keys to enter a new data value in the table.</p>
<p>(If preferred, the data can be copied and pasted into Desmos from a spreadsheet using keyboard shortcuts. Windows: Ctrl+C for copy and Ctrl+V for paste. Mac: Command+C for copy and Command+V for paste.)</p>

Use the mouse to drag and change the viewing window. To zoom in or out, use the buttons in the top right or the scrolling wheel on the mouse.</p>
<p>You should have created the following table and scatter plot:</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Click in the entry box #2 below the table from Step 1 and enter the command corr\((x_1,y_1)\).  (You can just type x1 and y1.  The subscripts will appear automatically.)</p>
<p>As soon as you enter the correlation command, Desmos will display the correlation coefficient after an equal sign in the bottom right corner of the same box.</p>
<img alt="A Desmos window showing the input expression t0 calculate the correlation between x1 and y1 values. The display indicates the value for this data set equals negative 0.299025180201." height="60" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4492301207904d727ef47d7da77ef455043d1ef7" width="300"/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><strong>Step 4 </strong>- Round to the nearest thousandth. The correlation coefficient is -0.299.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 </strong>- Determine the strength of the linear relationship. This correlation coefficient shows a weak negative linear relationship.</p>
