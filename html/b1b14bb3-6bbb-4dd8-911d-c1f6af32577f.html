<p>In this lesson, you will continue to work with quadratic expressions and functions and learn how to show (algebraically) that two different expressions can define the same function. You will discover the connections between different forms of quadratic expressions and features of the graphs that represent the expressions. You will learn that that some numbers in the expressions are related to the \(x\)- and \(y\)-intercepts of graphs representing expressions in standard and factored form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li> Explain the meaning of the intercepts on a graph of a quadratic function in terms of the situation it represents. </li>
<li> Explain how the numbers in the factored form of a quadratic expression relate to the intercepts of its graph. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the<strong> activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
