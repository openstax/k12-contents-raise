<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>The purpose of this lesson is for students to revisit the idea of average rate of change and apply it to exponential
  functions. While rate of change has an unambiguous meaning for linear functions, for nonlinear functions rates of
  change are not constant, so an interval must be specified.</p>
<p>In this lesson, students are first invited to recall how to calculate an average rate of change for a specific
  interval for a function represented by a data table. Students then consider the average rate of change for an
  exponential function describing the increase in the number of coffee shops for a business. By comparing the average
  rate of change of different intervals that all start at the same point, students can observe that while the average
  rate of change can describe how the data are changing with reasonable accuracy over some intervals, it is not a good
  predictor over larger intervals since exponential functions do not have a constant rate of change. In the last
  activity, students use the average rate of change to describe how the cost of producing 1 watt from a solar cell
  decreases in two separate intervals, which illuminates the nature of exponential decay to decrease at a slower rate.
  Contexts are used throughout this lesson to give students an opportunity to reason abstractly and quantitatively.</p>
<p>In future lessons, students will analyze multiple exponential functions at the same time and will be able to use the
  average rate of change to make comparisons among the functions over the same intervals.</p>
<h4> Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Calculate the average rate of change of a function over a specified interval. </li>
  <li> Explain (in writing) how well given rates of change reflect the changes in an exponential function. </li>
  <li> Understand that an exponential function, unlike a linear function, has different average rate of change values
    for different intervals. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Calculate the average rate of change of a function over a specified period of time. </li>
  <li> Recognize how the average rate of change of an exponential function differs from that of a linear function. </li>
