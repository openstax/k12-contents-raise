<h4>Activity</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Here are some situations you have seen before. Your teacher will give you one situation. Answer the questions for one situation. You will then meet with others in a group. You each will explain the situation and your answers.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Bank Accounts</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>A customer opens a checking account and a savings account at a bank. They will deposit a maximum of $600 will be deposited into the two accounts, some in the checking account and some in the savings account. (They might not deposit all of it and keep some of the money as cash.)</li>
  <li>The bank requires a minimum balance of $50 in the savings account. It does not matter how much money is kept in the checking account.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Concert Tickets</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Two kinds of tickets to an outdoor concert were sold: lawn tickets and seat tickets. Fewer than 400 tickets in total were sold.</li>
  <li>Lawn tickets cost $30 each, and seat tickets cost $50 each. The organizers want to make at least $14,000 from ticket sales.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Advertising Packages</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>An advertising agency offers two packages for small businesses that need advertising services. A basic package includes only design services. A premium package includes design and promotion. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to sell at least 60 packages in total.</li>
  <li>The basic advertising package has a value of $1,000, and the premium package has a value of $2,500. The goal of the agency is to sell more than $60,000 worth of small-business advertising packages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the discussions you had with your group members, answer the following questions about each situation. </p>
