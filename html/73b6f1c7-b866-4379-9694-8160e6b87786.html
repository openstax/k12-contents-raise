<h4>Activity</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Here are some situations you have seen before. Your teacher will give you one situation. Answer the questions for one situation. You will then meet with others in a group. You each will explain the situation and your answers.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Bank Accounts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A customer opens a checking account and a savings account at a bank. They will deposit a maximum of $600, some in the checking account and some in the savings account. (They might not deposit all of it and keep some of the money as cash.)</li>
<li>The bank requires a minimum balance of $50 in the savings account. It does not matter how much money is kept in the checking account.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Concert Tickets</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Two kinds of tickets to an outdoor concert were sold: lawn tickets and seat tickets. Fewer than 400 tickets in total were sold.</li>
<li>Lawn tickets cost $30 each, and seat tickets cost $50 each. The organizers want to make at least $14,000 from ticket sales.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Advertising Packages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An advertising agency offers two packages for small businesses that need advertising services. A basic package includes only design services. A premium package includes design and promotion. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to sell at least 60 packages in total.</li>
<li>The basic advertising package has a value of $1,000, and the premium package has a value of $2,500. The goal of the agency is to sell more than $60,000 worth of small-business advertising packages.</li>
</ul>
