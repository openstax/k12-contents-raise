<h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>
<p>In this lesson, students continue to develop their ability to identify, describe, and model relationships with
  mathematics.</p>
<p>Previously, students worked mostly with descriptions of familiar relationships and were guided to reason repeatedly,
  which enabled them to see a general relationship between two quantities. Here, students are given tables of values and
  asked to generalize the relationship between pairs of quantities&mdash;by studying the values and looking for
  patterns, and by interpreting them in context. Some of the relationships they encounter here are novel or otherwise
  require perseverance and careful reasoning to pin down.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h3>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify and describe (orally and in writing) patterns in tables of values and in calculations.</li>
  <li>Use observed patterns to generalize the relationships between quantities and to write equations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use words and equations to describe the patterns in a table of values or in a set of calculations.</li>
  <li>Use representations, like diagrams and tables, to help make sense of a described situation and write equations for
    it.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>


<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson. Encourage students to look for
    these words and notice their use and meanings.</li>
  <li>Encourage students to use key vocabulary words in &ldquo;math talk&rdquo; and their written and oral explanations.
  </li>
  <li>Utilize a word wall. Sample cards are located here: <a
