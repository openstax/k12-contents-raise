<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Han has a budget of $25 to buy grapes. Write inequalities to represent the number of pounds of grapes that Han could buy in each situation:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span>Grapes cost $1.99 per pound.</span></li>
  <li>Grapes cost $2.49 per pound.</li>
  <li>Grapes cost $\(c\) per pound.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<p>Let \( g \) represent the number of pounds of grapes.</p>
<ul>
  <li><span>\( 1.99g &le; 25 \)</span></li>
  <li>\( 2.49g &le; 25 \)</li>
  <li>\( cg &le; 25 \)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>More Chances&nbsp;</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.<br></p>
