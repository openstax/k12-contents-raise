<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Han has a budget of $25 to buy grapes. Write inequalities to represent the number of pounds of grapes that Han could buy in each situation:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Grapes cost $1.99 per pound.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( 1.99g &le; 25 \)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Grapes cost $2.49 per pound.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( 2.49g &le; 25 \)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Grapes cost $\(c\) per pound.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( cg &le; 25 \)</p>

<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.<br>
