<p>In middle school, students began building an understanding of how variables, expressions, equations, and inequalities
  could be used to represent quantities and relationships. Students also made connections among different kinds of
  representations&mdash;algebraic, verbal, tabular, and graphical. In this unit, students further develop their capacity
  to create, manipulate, interpret, and connect these representations and to use them for modeling.</p>

<p>In the first few lessons, students learn to think of equations as a way to represent constraints or limitations on
  quantities. (For instance, if the cost of food, \(f\), and the cost of drinks, \(d\), for a
  party add up to $80, we can write \( f + d = 80 \)to represent this constraint.) Students understand that when
  we solve equations, we are looking for values that satisfy the constraints and make the equations true. (For example,
  \(f = 53\) and \(d = 27\) could be a pair of solutions to \(f + d = 80\), but
  \(f = 50\) and \(d = 35\) could not be.) Students also see that graphs of equations can help
  us make sense of constraints and identify values that satisfy them.</p>
<p>Students then investigate different ways to express the same relationship or constraint&mdash;by analyzing and
  writing equivalent equations. They look at moves that can transform one equation to an equivalent equation,
  recognizing that these are the moves we make to solve equations. The focus here is not only on identifying acceptable
  moves for solving, but also on explaining why these moves keep each subsequent equation true and maintain the
  solutions of the original equation.</p>
<p>Along the way, students realize that some equations are more helpful than others, depending on what we want to know.
  In some equations, the quantity of interest is easy to pin down. In others, we may need to manipulate the equation and
  solve for a particular variable. Students also explore how the form and the parts of a linear equation in two
  variables are related to the features of its graph. They see that understanding the structure and connections across
  representations can give us deeper insights about the situation being studied.</p>
<p>The unit closes with students writing and solving direct variations. This expands their understanding of linear
  equations and makes a connection to their understanding of proportional reasoning from middle school.</p>
