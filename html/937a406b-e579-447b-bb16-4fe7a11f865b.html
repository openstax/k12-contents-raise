<h3>Cool Down Activity (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>The problems below consist of pairs of equivalent expressions: one in standard form and the other in factored form. Note that the leading coefficients on the quadratic terms are all 1.</p>
<p>Find the missing numbers.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>\(x^2\; +\) __\(x\; +\) __ and \((x + 1)(x + 17)\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 18 and 17, respectively. The completed expression is \(x^2+18x +17\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li>\(x^2+9x +14\) and \((x + 2)(x\; +\) __\()\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 7. The completed expression is \((x + 2)(x + 7)\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
<li>\(x^2&minus;7x +10\) and \((x &minus; 2)(x\; &minus;\) __\()\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 5. The completed expression is \((x &minus; 2)(x &minus; 5)\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
<li>\(x^2&minus;9x +20\) and \((x\; &minus;\) __\()(x\; &minus;\) __\()\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 4 and 5. The completed expression is \((x &minus; 4)(x &minus; 5)\).</p>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>If students make computational errors, address those in the next lesson and emphasize the use of diagrams.</p>
