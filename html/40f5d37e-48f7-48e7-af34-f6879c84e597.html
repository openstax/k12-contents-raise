<p dir="ltr">Graph a Line Using Its Slope and \(y\)-intercepts</p>
<p dir="ltr">We have graphed linear equations by plotting points, using intercepts, recognizing horizontal and vertical lines, and using one point and the slope of the line. Once we see how an equation in slope&ndash;intercept form and its graph are related, we&rsquo;ll have one more method we can use to graph lines.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Let&rsquo;s look at the graph of the equation \(y=\frac12x+3\) and find its slope and \(y\)-intercept.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="The figure shows the graph of a straight line on the x y-coordinate plane. The x-axis runs from negative 10 to 10. The y-axis runs from negative 10 to 10. The line goes through the points (0, 3), (2, 4), and (4, 5). A right triangle is drawn by connecting the three points (2, 4), (2, 5), and (4, 5). The vertical side of the triangle is labeled &ldquo;Rise equals 1&rdquo;. The horizontal side of the triangle is labeled &ldquo;Run equals 2&rdquo;. The line is labeled y equals 1 divided by 2 x plus 3." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/f937e5f1161104d9a837fb53f6309b01a60c9ddb"></p>
<p dir="ltr">The red lines in the graph show us the rise is 1 and the run is 2. Substituting into the slope formula:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>\(m\;=\;\frac{rise}{run}\)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>\(m\;=\;\frac12\)</span><br></p>
<p dir="ltr">The \(y\)-intercept is 3.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Look at the equation of this line.</span><br></p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="The figure shows the equation y equals 1 divided by 2 x plus 3. The 1 divided by 2 is emphasized in red. The 3 is emphasized in blue." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b36bf7a670459746e9a1fabd509a28ada41b5480"><br></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Look at the slope and \(y\)-intercepts.</span><br></p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="Slope m equals 1 divided by 2 and \(y\)-intercepts (0, 3). The 1 divided by 2 is emphasized in red. The 3 is emphasized in blue." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/2dcafc494d7301fb1efde000957d3562d4e7a223"><br></p>
<p dir="ltr">Slope \(m\) equals 1 divided by 2 and \(y\)-intercept (0, 3). The 1 divided by 2 is emphasized in red. The 3 is emphasized in blue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When a linear equation is solved for \(y\), the coefficient of the \(x\) term is the slope and the constant term is the \(y\)-coordinate of the \(y\)-intercept. We say that the equation \(y=\frac12x+3\) is in slope&ndash;intercept form. Sometimes the slope&ndash;intercept form is called the &ldquo;y-form.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="m equals 1 divided by 2; \(y\)-intercepts is (0, 3). y equals 1 divided by 2 x plus 3. y equals m x plus b. The m and 1 divided by 2 are emphasized in red. The b and 3 are emphasized in blue." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/814b0b670b8d5e1e2b91b36ce0866f9304ab26fb"><br></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The slope&ndash;intercept form of an equation of a line with slope \(m\) and \(y\)-intercept, (0,b) is \(y=mx+b\).</span><br></p>
