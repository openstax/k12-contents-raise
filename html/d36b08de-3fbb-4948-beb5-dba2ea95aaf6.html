<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Interpret points in the coordinate plane and decide if they are solutions to the inequality, given a two-variable inequality that represents a situation.</li>
  <li>Find the solutions to a two-variable inequality by using the graph of a related two-variable equation.</li>
  <li>Write inequalities to describe the constraints in a situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2.12.1: Sketching a Graph to Represent an Equation
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you reviewed writing and graphing an equation that represents a situation. This prepared you to write linear inequalities that represent constraints in situations and graphing the solution regions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>2.12.2: Writing an Inequality to Represent a Constraint
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you wrote an inequality to represent a constraint in a situation. You graphed a related equation, interpreted the coordinate pairs of points on the graph and on either side of the graph, and tested the pairs of values to see if they make the inequality true. You then used these observations to determine the solution region to the inequality.</li>

      <li>2.12.2: Additional Resources</li>
    </ul>
  <li>2.12.3: Graphing Solutions and Interpreting Points<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you continued to work with inequalities in two variables in context. You wrote an inequality that represents the constraints in a situation, graphed its solutions, and interpreted points in the solution region </li>

      <li>2.12.3: Additional Resources</li>
    </ul>
  <li>2.12.4: Recognizing Points Along Boundary Line
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you had an additional opportunity for writing a linear inequality in two variables to represent constraints and for graphing and interpreting the solutions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>2.12.5: Recognizing Points for an Inequality</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In this activity, you had more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas and receive guidance for what to look for to identify when an inequality represents the constraints in a situation.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice:</strong></p>
