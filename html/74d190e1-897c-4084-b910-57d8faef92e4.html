<h4>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h4>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<p>Here is another riddle:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The sum of two numbers is less than 2.</li>
  <li>If we subtract the second number from the first, the difference is greater than 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the two numbers?</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>The riddle can be represented by a system of inequalities. Write an inequality for each statement.</li>
  <li>These graphs represent the inequalities in the system.</li>
</ol>

</div>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Which graph represents which inequality?</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Name a possible solution to the riddle. Explain or show how you know.</span></p>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li><span>\(\left\{\begin{array}{l}x+y&lt;2\\x-y&gt;1\end{array}\right.\)&nbsp;</span></li>
  <li>The region with solid blue shading represents the first clue. The region with line shading represents the second clue.</li>
  <li>For example: \((1.5,0)\). The sum is 1.5, which is less than 2. The difference is 1.5, which is greater than 1. The point \((1.5,0)\) is located in the region where the two shaded regions overlap, which means it is a solution to both inequalities in the system.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p dir="ltr">Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
