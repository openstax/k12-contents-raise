<p>
  In this project, you will apply your prior knowledge about plotting coordinate points, evaluating expressions using the correct order of operations, and simplifying algebraic expressions, to generate initial ideas about functions.
</p>

<p>First, you will be asked to play with a simulation for a few minutes. This open play time allows for you to learn how to use a simulation for learning and discover how to interact with it. You will have an opportunity to share how you used the simulation during the open play time. Be sure you are aware of the controls and how to use the simulation.</p>

<p>When you engage with the activity sheet, you should be pausing to discuss some of your responses with a partner. Be prepared to stop and share your individual responses and partner discussions with the whole class.</p>

<p>By the end of the lesson, you should have completed the activity sheets using the simulation, and should be able to describe a function as having inputs, outputs, and behaving consistently. You should also be able to evaluate a function using different inputs, and be able to summarize the impact that certain operations have on the algebraic function, the table of values, the appearance of the graph, and the outputs.</p>

<p>
  When you finish this project, you will have demonstrated how to:
  
</p><ul>
  <li>Define a function as a rule relating each input to exactly one output and consistently acting on inputs.</li>
  <li>Predict outputs of a function using given inputs.</li>
  <li>Describe a linear function in terms of a table, graph, equation, or series of operations.</li>
</ul>


<p>Today you are going to investigate something called an interactive simulation. It is a tool that will help you visualize how functions work.
  <br><br>
  If you do not have an activity sheet, you may use this page to complete the project.<br><br>
  To begin, open the <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/function-builder/latest/function-builder_en.html" target="_blank"> Function Builder activity</a> in your web browser. You will use it to complete this project. It will look like this:</p>

<p>
    Play with any of the screens on the Function Builder for 5 minutes. 
  
</p>  
<p>  As you discover how the tool works, share your thinking with your group members. You may want to use the following question and sentence stem to guide your discussions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>What did you try? What happened?</em></li> 
  <li><em>I tried … and it caused … to happen. </em></li>
</ul>
<p>  Write down two things you notice or have questions about, and one thing a neighbor noticed that is interesting to you. </p>
