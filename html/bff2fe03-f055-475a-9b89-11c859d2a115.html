<p>Today you are going to investigate something called an interactive simulation. It is a tool that will help you visualize how functions work.
  <br><br>
  If you do not have an activity sheet, you may use this page to complete the project.<br><br>
  To begin, open the <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/function-builder/latest/function-builder_en.html" target="_blank"> Function Builder activity</a> in your web browser. You will use it to complete this project. It will look like this:</p>

<p>
    Play with any of the screens on the Function Builder for 5 minutes. 
  
</p>  
<p>  As you discover how the tool works, share your thinking with your group members. You may want to use the following question and sentence stem to guide your discussions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>What did you try? What happened?</em></li> 
  <li><em>I tried … and it caused … to happen. </em></li>
</ul>
<p>  Write down two things you notice or have questions about, and one thing a neighbor noticed that is interesting to you. </p>
