<p>Today you are going to investigate something called an interactive simulation. It is a tool that will help you visualize how functions work.</p>

  <p class="os-raise-text-center"><img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/7b20529fd41c1a24ad0c6e3ce0ff5947b66ad0c6" height="300"></p>

  <p><strong>Step 1</strong> - <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/function-builder/latest/function-builder_en.html" target="_blank">Open the interactive simulator, Function Builder</a> in your web browser. You will use it to complete this project. It will look like the image above.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Play with any of the screens on the Function Builder for 5 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - As you discover how the tool works, share your thinking with your group members. You may want to use the following question and sentence stem to guide your discussions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did you try? What happened?</li>
    <li>I tried … and it caused … to happen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Write down two things you notice or have questions about, and one thing a neighbor noticed that is interesting to you.</p>
