<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>The goal of this activity is to use the vertex form to find out if a vertex represents the minimum or the maximum value of the function. To do this, students rely on the behavior of a quadratic function, the structure of the expression, and some properties of operations.</p>
<p>Because using structure is central to the work here, graphing technology is not an appropriate tool.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two and ask students to keep their materials closed.</p>
<p>Display the equation \(p(x)=(x&minus;8)^2+1\) for all to see. Ask students how they would determine, without graphing, if the vertex of the graph, \((8,1)\), is a maximum or a minimum. Give partners a moment to discuss their thinking. Solicit a few ideas from the class before asking students to proceed to the activity.</p>
<p>Ask students to take a couple of minutes of quiet time to think individually to make sense of the line of reasoning in the first question and then discuss their understanding with their partner.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>The graph that represents \(p(x)=(x&minus;8)^2+1\) has its vertex at \((8,1)\). Here is one way to show, without graphing, that \((8,1)\) corresponds to the <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">minimum</span> value of \(p\).</li>
</ol>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> When \(x=8\), the value of \((x&minus;8)^2\) is 0 because \((8&minus;8)^2=0^2=0\). </li>
  <li> Squaring any number always results in a positive number, so when \(x\) is any value other than 8, \((x&minus;8)\) will be a number other than 0, and when squared, \((x&minus;8)^2\) will be positive. </li>
  <li> Any positive number is greater than 0, so when \(x \neq 8\), the value of \((x&minus;8)^2\) will be greater than when \(x=8\). In other words, \(p\) has the least value when \(x=8\). </li>

<p>Use similar reasoning to explain why the point \((4,1)\) corresponds to the maximum value of \(q\), defined by \(q(x)=-2(x&minus;4)^2+1\).</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> When \(x=4\), the value of \((x&minus;4)^2\) is 0 because \(-2(4&minus;4)^2=-2(0^2)=0\). </li>
  <li> Squaring any number always results in a positive number, so when \(x\) is any value other than 4 (either greater or less), \((x&minus;4)\) will be a number other than 0. When squared, \((x&minus;4)^2\) will be positive, but then it gets multiplied to a negative number, so the product will be negative. </li>
  <li> Any negative number is less than 0, so when \(x \neq 4\), the value of \(-2(x&minus;4)^2\) will be less than when \(x=4\). In other words, \(q\) has the greatest value when \(x=4\). </li>
</ul>
<p>The greatest value of a function is the maximum value. The lowest value of a function is the minimum value. Since infinity cannot be reached or touched, it is not considered a maximum or minimum.</p>
<p>In quadratic functions, the maximum or minimum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Here are some quadratic functions and the coordinates of the vertex of the graph of each. Determine if the vertex corresponds to the maximum or the minimum value of the function.</li>

<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5> Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>Here is a portion of the graph of function \(q\), defined by \(q(x)=-x^2+14x&minus;40\).</p>
<p><img height="182" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/41f2639468a13e21e3859a1761fc87e759a7bee0" width="254"></p>
<p>\(ABCD\) is a rectangle. Points \(A\) and \(B\) coincide with the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph, and segment \(CD\) just touches the vertex of the graph.</p>
<p>Find the area of \(ABCD\). Show your reasoning.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 54 square units.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> The expression can be rewritten in factored form as \((-x+10)(x&minus;4)\), so the \(x\)-intercepts are \((4,0)\) and \((10,0)\), which means the length of \(AB\) is 6 units. The \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex is halfway between 4 and 10, which is 7. Substituting 7 for \(x\) in \((- x + 10)(x &minus; 4)\) gives \(3 \cdot 3\) or 9, so the height of the rectangle is 9. The area is \(6 \cdot 9\) or 54 square units. </li>
  <li> The equation \(q(x)=-x^2+14x&minus;40\) can be written in vertex form as \(q(x)=-1(x&minus;7)^2+9\), so its vertex is at \((7,9)\) and the height of the rectangle is 9 units. Completing the square for \(-x^2+14x&minus;40=0\) gives the solutions \(x=4\) and \(x=10\), which correspond to the \(x\)-intercepts at points \(A\) and \(B\). This means the width of the rectangle is \(10&minus;4\) or 6 units. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Focus the discussion on students' responses to the first question. Invite students to share their explanations and highlight reasoning that makes use of structure (as shown in the sample response).</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Squaring an expression results in a positive value or a zero value. </li>
  <li> Zero is the least possible value of a squared expression. </li>
  <li> Multiplying a squared expression (which is either positive or zero) by a negative number gives either a negative or zero value. </li>
  <li> The graph of a quadratic function is symmetrical across the vertex. If an input value on one side of the vertex \((h,k)\) produces an output that is less than \(k\), then \((h,k)\) represents the maximum value of the function. Similarly, if an input value on one side of the vertex \((h,k)\) produces an output that is more than \(k\), then \((h,k)\) represents the minimum value of the function. </li>
</ul>

<h3>9.9.2: Additional Resources</h3>
<p><strong><em>The following content is available to students who would like more support based on their experience with the self check. Students will not automatically have access to this content, so you may wish to share it with those who could benefit from it.</em></strong></p>
<h4>Identify a Maximum or Minimum</h4>
<p>Recall that the maximum is the highest point of the graph and the minimum is the lowest point of the graph. A quadratic function shape is called a parabola, and a parabola will only have a maximum or a minimum.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Graph \(f(x)=(x-2)^2-1\).</p>
<p><img height="300" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/6b7d92da4b9e23464c6878c9a52d947418138326" width="300"></p>
<p>In the vertex form (of a quadratic expression), \(f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k\), the <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">vertex (of a graph)</span> is located at \((h, k)\).</p>
<p>For the function graphed, the vertex is at \((2, -1)\).</p>
<p>Since the leading coefficient, \(a\), is positive, the parabola opens up. This means the vertex is a minimum.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Graph \(f(x)=-(x+1)^2+3\).</p>
<p><img height="298" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/187a41f4c1a5982786eb351451de526860e9f217" width="300"></p>
<p>The vertex is located at \((-1, 3)\).</p>
<p>Since the leading coefficient is negative, the parabola opens down and the vertex is a maximum.</p>
<h4>Try It: Identify a Maximum or Minimum</h4>
<p>For the function \(f(x)=(x+4)^2-2\), identify the vertex and tell if it is a maximum or minimum.</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to identify if a vertex is a maximum or minimum:</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Identify the vertex \((h, k)\). <br>
  \((-4, -2)\) </p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Identify if the parabola opens up or down. <br>
  Since the leading coefficient is positive, the parabola opens up. </p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Identify if the vertex is a maximum or minimum. <br>
  Since the parabola opens up, the vertex is a minimum. </p>
