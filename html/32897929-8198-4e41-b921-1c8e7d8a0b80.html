<p>Display for all to see the equations \(f(x)=5x+3\) and \(g(x)=10x-4\). Ask students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;How would you describe to a classmate who is absent today what each equation means? What would you say to help them make sense of these?&rdquo; (Each equation gives the rule of a function. The rule for \(f\) says that, to get the output, we multiply the input by 5 and add 3. The rule for \(g\) says that the output is 10 times the input, minus 4.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How do the rules help us find the value of \(f(10)\) or \(g(10)\)?&rdquo; (If we substitute 10 for \(x\) in each equation and evaluate the expression, we would have the values of \(f\) or \(g\) at \(x=10\), which are 53 and 96, respectively.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Is it possible to graph a function described this way? How?&rdquo; (We could create a table of values and find the coordinate pairs at different \(x\)-values. Or, if a rule is expressed as a linear equation, we could use it to identify the slope and vertical intercept of the graph.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
