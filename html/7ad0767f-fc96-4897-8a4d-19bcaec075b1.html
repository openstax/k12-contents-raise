<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity allows students to practice rewriting quadratic expressions in standard form by using the structure they observed in the earlier activity.</p>
<p>As students work, look for those who approach the work systematically: by looking for two factors of the constant term that add up to the coefficient of the linear term of the expression in standard form, listing the possible pairs of factors, and checking their chosen pair. Invite them to share their strategy during discussion.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Consider arranging students in groups of two and asking them to think quietly about the equivalent expressions before conferring with their partner. Leave a few minutes for a whole-class discussion.</p>
<p>Ask students to complete as many equivalent expressions as time permits while aiming to complete at least the first seven rows in the table. Then, ask them to generalize their observations in the last row.</p>

<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>A mathematician threw a party. She told her guests, "I have a riddle for you. I have three daughters. The product of their ages is 72. The sum of their ages is the same as my house number. How old are my daughters?"</p>
<p>The guests went outside to look at the house number. They thought for a few minutes, and then they said, "This riddle can't be solved!"</p>
<p>The mathematician said, "Oh yes, I forgot to tell you the last clue. My youngest daughter prefers strawberry ice cream."</p>
<p>With this last clue, the guests could solve the riddle. How old are the mathematician's daughters? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 2, 6, and 6.</p>
<p>If the product of their ages is 72, there are twelve possibilities:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> 1, 1, 72 </li>
  <li> 1, 2, 36 </li>
  <li> 1, 3, 24 </li>
  <li> 1, 4, 18 </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> 1, 6, 12 </li>
  <li> 1, 8, 9 </li>
  <li> 2, 2, 18 </li>
  <li> 2, 3, 12 </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> 2, 4, 9 </li>
  <li> 2, 6 ,6 </li>
  <li> 3, 3, 8 </li>
  <li> 3, 4, 6 </li>
</ul>
<p>Because the riddle can't be solved by knowing the house number (the sum of the three numbers), it must be the case that there are ages that have the same sum. The only sets of ages with the same sum are 3, 3, 8 and 2, 6, 6, which each add up to 14. From the last clue, we know that there is a youngest daughter. The only set of ages that has a "youngest" age are 2, 6, 6, so these are the ages of the three daughters.</p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may struggle to remember how each term in standard form relates to the numbers in the equivalent expression in factored form. Encourage them to use a diagram (as in the earlier activity) to go from factored form to standard form, and then work backward.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Focus first on the first three rows. Ask one or more students to share their equivalent expressions and any diagrams that they drew. Point out that this is a fairly straightforward application of the distributive property, which students first learned about in grade 6.</p>
<p>Select students to share how they transformed the remaining expressions from standard form to factored form, using specific examples in their explanations. For the example of \(x^2+13x +12\), highlight that:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> We are looking for two factors of 12. </li>
  <li> We are looking for two numbers with a sum of 13. </li>
  <li> One strategy is to list out all the factor pairs of 12. </li>
  <li> Another strategy is to list out all pairs of numbers that add up to 13, but usually the list of factors is shorter. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Rewriting Quadratic Expressions in Standard Form</h4>
<p>We have had a lot of practice rewriting factored form into standard form. To reverse this process, many of the same skills are needed.</p>
<p>Let's look at an example.</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 1</p>
<p>Write \(x^2+16x +63\) in factored form.</p>
<p>To do this, we must think about how you converted from factored form into standard form. First, check if the leading coefficient (for the quadratic term) is 1. If so, then:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> To find the coefficient of the middle term, 16, we added two numbers together from the diagram. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> To find the last term or constant, 63, we multiplied two numbers together from the diagram. </li>
</ul>
<p>So, which numbers, \(a\) and \(b\), have a sum of 16 and a product of 63?</p>
<p><img alt=" DIAGRAM THAT SHOWS A PLUS B AND A TIMES B WITH ARROWS GOING TO 16 AND 63 IN THE QUADRATIC EXPRESSION, X-SQUARED PLUS 16X PLUS 63." height="147" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/864bde4e5cff9d5f8e6acdf306622f0e768223e7" width="200"></p>
<p>The positive factors of 63 include:</p>
<p>1, 63<br>
  3, 21<br>
  7, 9</p>
<p>With some reasoning, we find that 7 and 9 are the numbers we want.</p>
<p>So, the factored form of \(x^2+16x +63\) is \((x + 7)(x + 9)\).</p>
<p>Let's look at another example.</p>
<p class="os'">Example 2</p>
<p>Write \(x^2&minus;10x +16\) in factored form.</p>
<p>The sign of the middle term is negative, but we follow the same process since the coefficient of \(x^2\) is 1.</p>
<p>Let's rewrite the expression as \(x^2+ -10x +16\).</p>
<p>Which numbers have a sum of &ndash;10 and a product of 16?</p>
<p>The factors of 16 include:</p>
<p>1, 16<br>&ndash;1, &ndash;16<br>
  2, 8<br>&ndash;2, &ndash;8<br>
  4, 4<br>&ndash;4, &ndash;4</p>
<p>The numbers we need are &ndash;2 and &ndash;8 because they have a product of 16 and a sum of &ndash;10.</p>
<p>So, the factored form is \((x + (-2))(x + (-8))\). This can be rewritten as \((x &minus; 2)(x &minus; 8)\).</p>

<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to rewrite quadratic equations in standard form into factored form:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>\((x + 6)(x + 3)\); Since the coefficients of the \(x\)-terms are both 1, think of two numbers that have a sum of 9 and a product of 18.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>\((x &minus; 5)(x &minus; 7)\); Since the coefficients of the \(x\)-terms are both 1, think of two numbers that have a sum of &ndash;12 and a product of 35.</li>
</ol>
