<p>In this lesson, you will learn how a function can be represented by two different equations. You will find any term of an arithmetic sequence directly, by using the nth term formula to find any term number \(n\).</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Describe the nth term.</li>
  <li>Find terms of sequences directly.</li>
  <li>Explain why different equations can represent the same sequence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    4.18.1 Repeated Operations
