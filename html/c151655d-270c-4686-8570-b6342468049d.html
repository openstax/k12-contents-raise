<h3>Activity: P9.1: Equations of Two Lines and a Curve</h3>
<p>Write an equation representing the line that passes through each pair of points.</p>
<ol>
  <li> \((3, 3)\) and \((5, 5)\) </li>
  <li>\((0, 4)\) and \((−4, 0)\) </li>
</ol>
<p>Solve this equation: \(x+1=(x−2)^2−3\). Show your reasoning.</p>
<h3>Activity: P9.2: Analyzing a Dive</h3>
<p>The function \(h\), defined by \(h(t)=−5t^2+10t+7.5\), models the height of a diver above the water (in meters) \(t\)</p>
<p>seconds after the diver leaves the board. For each question, explain your reasoning.</p>
<ol>
  <li> How high above the water is the diving board? </li>
  <li> When does the diver hit the water? </li>
  <li> At what point during her descent toward the water is the diver at the same height as the diving board? </li>
  <li> When does the diver reach the maximum height of the dive? </li>
  <li> What is the maximum height the diver reaches during the dive? </li>
</ol>
<h3>Activity: P9.3: A Linear Function and a Quadratic Function</h3>
<p>Here are graphs of a linear function and a quadratic function. The quadratic function is defined by the expression&nbsp;</p>
<p>\((x-4)^2-5\)</p>
<p>Find the coordinates of P, Q, and R without using graphing technology. Show your reasoning.</p>

<h3>Activity: P9.4: Profit from a River Cruise</h3>
<p>A travel company uses a quadratic function to model the profit, in dollars, that it expects to earn from selling tickets to a river cruise at \(d\) dollars per person. The expression \(-d^2+100d-900\) defines this function.</p>
<p>Without graphing, find the price that would generate the maximum profit. Then, determine that maximum profit.</p>
