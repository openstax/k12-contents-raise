<h3>Narrative</h3>
<p>In this culminating lesson, you will synthesize methods of solving quadratic equations and graphing quadratic functions to answer questions about within a context. You will use tools learned throughout the unit to grapple with solving problems about a quadratic function that represents a context. Since this work requires using what you know to tackle an unfamiliar problem, you will need to make sense of problems and demonstrate perseverance.
</p>
<p>Technology isn't required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for you  to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems. 
</p>
<p>When you finish this project, you will have demonstrated how to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Interpret information about a quadratic function given its equation or a graph.
  </li>
  <li>Rewrite quadratic functions in different but equivalent forms of my choosing and use that form to solve problems.
  </li>
  <li>Decide which quadratic form to use depending on the questions being asked.
  </li>
</ul>
