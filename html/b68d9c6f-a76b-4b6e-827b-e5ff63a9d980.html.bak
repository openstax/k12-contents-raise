<p>In this activity, whenever you see 💬, stop and share your responses with your partner. If you have different responses, try to come to a consensus.</p>
<p>In the first activity, you may have noticed that all of the simulation screens share a three-part structure. These three parts can be described in a variety of ways, such as the ones listed in the image below. </p>

<br/>
<p><li>Come up with your own names or labels for the three parts of a function.</li></p>
<p><li> Share your labels with your group. Write down any similarities. 💬</li></p>
<p>For 3 - 4, use the following instructions.</p>
<blockquote>Use the simulation screen labeled “Patterns”. Note you can switch between simulation screens using the toolbar located below the function builder.</blockquote>
<p><li>The blue “builder” in the middle of the screen is a function. Describe what a function is using the labels you've agreed on as a class. 💬</li></p>
<p><li>Suppose you build this function:</li></p>
