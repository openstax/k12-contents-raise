<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity allows students to integrate several skills and ideas they have learned so far: solving quadratic equations by graphing and by completing the square, using the \(\pm\) notation, and expressing solutions both approximately and exactly (using the square root symbol). In solving the equations algebraically and using the notations to express and verify solutions, students practice attending to precision.</p>
<p>The last equation may be challenging for some students as it involves fractions and messier-looking solutions. It is not essential that all students get to this equation. They will have a chance to encounter more complicated equations and solutions in upcoming lessons.</p>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<p>Display the equation \(x^2+6x+7=0\) for all to see. Ask students if they could solve it by rewriting it in factored form. (The expression cannot be rewritten in factored form.) Remind students that they know how to solve any equation by completing the square, which would give exact solutions. They also know how to solve by graphing, which would give approximate solutions.</p>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two and provide access to graphing technology. One partner should find exact solutions by completing the square and the other should find approximate solutions by graphing. Partners should confirm that the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph (or the zeros of the function represented by the graph) approximate the exact solutions obtained algebraically. Ask partners to switch roles for each equation.</p>

Display the following sentence frames for all to see: “That could (or couldn’t) be true because . . .”, “How do you know . . .?”, and “How did you get . . . ?” Encourage students to challenge each other when they disagree.

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here is an example of an equation being solved by graphing and by completing the square.</p>

</p>
<p>Verify: \(\sqrt{2}\) is approximately 1.414. So \(-3+ \sqrt{2} \approx -1.586\) and \(-3- \sqrt{2} \approx -4.414\).</p>
<p>For each equation, find the exact solutions by completing the square and the approximate solutions by graphing. Then, verify that the solutions found using the two methods are close. If you get stuck, refer back to the example.</p>

  Solutions were the same: \(x \approx -0.862\) and \(x \approx -1.805\).</p>
<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>What quadratic equation of the form \(ax^2+bx+c=0\) would have the solutions \(x=5&minus; \sqrt{2}\) and \(x=5+ \sqrt{2}\)?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x^2&minus;10x+23=0\)</p>
<p>Working backward, these are solutions to \((x&minus;5)^2=2\). In standard form, this is \(x^2&minus;10x+23=0\).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Discuss any common struggles or common mistakes made when solving the equations. Then, invite students to reflect on the merits and challenges of solving by each method. Ask questions such as:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> "What are some benefits of solving by graphing? What are some drawbacks?" (Benefits: It is quick and straightforward. It shows the solutions, or that there are no solutions, even when the equations involve fractions or very large numbers. Drawbacks: It does not give exact solutions. Some tools may require adjusting the graphing window quite a bit to see the solutions.) </li>
  <li> "What are some benefits and drawbacks of solving by completing the square?" (Benefit: It can be used to find exact solutions to any equation. Drawbacks: It can be pretty time consuming. When the equations have fractions or very large or very small numbers, the calculations get complicated and may be prone to error.) </li>
</ul>

<h4>Using the Calculator for Approximate Solutions</h4>
<p>Let's look at the solutions to the equations from 9.5.2: Additional Resources:</p>
<p>A more compact way to write the two solutions to the equation \((x+4)^2=11\) is: \(x=-4 \pm \sqrt{11}\).</p>
<p>How large or small are those numbers? Are they positive or negative? We can use a calculator to compute the approximate values of both expressions:</p>
<p>\(-4+ \sqrt{11} \approx -0.683\) or \(-4- \sqrt{11} \approx -7.317\)</p>
<p>We can also approximate the solutions by graphing. The equation \((x+4)^2=11\) is equivalent to \((x+4)^2&minus;11=0\), so we can graph the function \(y=(x+4)^2&minus;11\) and find its zeros by locating the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph.</p>
