    <h3>Cool Down Activity<br></h3>
    <p>At a fabric store, fabrics are sold by the yard. A dressmaker spent $36.35 on 4.25 yards of silk and cotton fabrics for a dress. Silk is $16.90 per yard, and cotton is $4 per yard. </p>
    <p>Here is a system of equations that represent the constraints in the situation.</p>
    <p>\( \displaystyle \begin{cases}
      \begin {align} x + \hspace{2.2mm} y &amp;= \hspace{2mm} 4.25\\ 16.90x +
      4y &amp;= 36.35 \end{align} \end{cases} \)</p>

        The solution represents the combination of lengths of silk and cotton (in
        yards) that meet both constraints-they add up to 4.25 yards and the cost
        of buying both is $36.35.</li>
