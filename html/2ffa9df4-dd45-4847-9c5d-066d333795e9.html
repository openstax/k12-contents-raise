<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity has students creating tables of values from verbal descriptions. Students will then work to use the tables of values to write linear equations. To see the connection to linear equations, students will write their own scenarios and then have a partner create a representative table of values. They will then plot the coordinates from the tables and see the linear pattern.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Ask students to think about a job they or a friend has ever had. How much did they get paid after 1 hour? Two hours? Three hours? What if they earned a $1 raise? Then what would they receive after 1 hour? Two hours? Three hours? What do you notice?</p>
<p>As students work, be sure to circulate and prompt students to work through the situations to create the next values in the table.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<h5>Creating a Table of Values</h5>
<p>For each situation in numbers 1–3, create a table of values with at least five columns to represent the situation.</p>

<h5>Using a Table of Values to Write Equations</h5>
<p>Table of values can be used to write equations. The tables from <strong>Creating a Table of Values</strong> all represent linear equations.
</p>
<p>For questions 4-8, revisit the table from question 1 and write an equation to represent the table of values. Notice that columns for the \(x\) and \(y\) values are added.

<h4>Video: Writing an Equation from a Table of Values</h4>
<p>Watch the following video to learn more about writing equations from a table of values.</p>
<p>[[insert media lesson 1.13]]</p>
<h5>Create Your Own Situation</h5>
<p>Think of your own situation that could be modeled by a linear equation. Create a table of values that represents that situation. Write your problem down then switch with a partner. Make a table of values for each other’s problems. Then, check your work together.
</p>
<p>Next, plot the points of each table of values in a coordinate plane. 
Answer the questions after discussing with your partner:
</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Describe the scenario created by your partner. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Answers vary.</p>
<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li> Use Desmos to graph the table of values to represent your partner’s scenario. (Students were provided access to Desmos). </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Answers vary.</p>
<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li> Does your partner&rsquo;s data model a linear relationship or not? Describe how you determined your answer. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>The points form a line. This happens because the same number was added to each value in the top row and the same number was added to each value in the bottom row of the tables</p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>When writing an equation from a table, students often switch the slope and \(y\)-intercept in the slope-intercept form of an equation. Continue to emphasize the \(y\)-intercept is the starting value when \(x=0\) and the slope is the rate of change.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Have pairs of students share their situations and matching tables of values. Discuss what shape the graphs are all taking and why. As students plot their points, they should recognize that a linear pattern forms. Help students connect the linear pattern to there being the same slope between points.</p>
<br>
<div class="os-raise-graybox">
  <h5>Support for English Language Learners:</h5>
  <p>As they write their situations, monitor ELL students to ensure that they learn relationships between sounds and letters of the English language to represent sounds when writing in English.    </p>
  <p>As they share and discuss with partners, have ELL students practice producing sounds of newly acquired vocabulary such as long and short vowels, silent letters, and consonant clusters to pronounce English words in a manner that is increasingly comprehensible in vocabulary words such as slope and intercept.</p>
  <p>During collaboration with partners, monitor ELL students to ensure that they are distinguishing sounds and intonation patterns of English with increasing ease. They should recognize elements of the English sound system in newly acquired vocabulary such as long and short vowels, silent letters, and consonant clusters.  Additionally, they need to learn relationships between sounds and letters of the English language and decode (sound out) words using a combination of skills such as recognizing sound-letter relationships and identifying cognates, affixes, roots, and base words in words such as linear, graphing, and plotting</p>

<h4>Writing Linear Equations from Tables</h4>
<p>When writing linear equations from tables, it is important to identify the slope and the \(y\)-intercepts from the table.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Given the table, write an equation in slope-intercept form.</p>


<table class="os-raise-horizontaltable">
  <thead></thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">\(x\)</th>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>4</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">\(y\)</th>
        <td>12</td>
        <td>16</td>
        <td>20</td>
        <td>24</td>
        <td>28</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

<br>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Identify the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p>The \(y\)-intercept is the starting value, when \(x=0\).<br>
  Looking at the table, when \(x = 0\), the \(y\)-value is 12, so this is the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Identify the slope.</p>
<p>Slope is the change in \(y\) over the change in \(x\).<br>
  The \(y\)-values change by 4 each time. The \(x\)-values change by 1 each time.</p>
<p>The slope is \(\frac41\) or 4.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Write the equation in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p>Slope intercept form is \(y = mx +b\), where \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the \(y\)-intercept.<br>
  Substitute the values, \(y = 4x +12\).</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Compare your answer:</p>
<p>Here is how to write the equation in slope-intercept form:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Identify the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p>The \(y\)-intercept is the starting value, when \(x=0\).<br>
  Looking at the table, when \(x = 0\), the \(y\)-value is 6, so this is the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Identify the slope.</p>
<p>Slope is the change in \(y\) over the change in \(x\).<br>
  The \(y\)-values change by 5 each time. The \(x\)-values change by 1 each time.<br>
  The slope is \(\frac51\) or 5.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Write the equation in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p>Slope intercept form is \(y = mx +b\), where \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the \(y\)-intercept.<br>
  Substitute the values, \(y = 5x +6\).</p>
