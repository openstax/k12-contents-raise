<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify important features of graphs of functions and explain what they mean in the situations represented.</li>
  <li>Explain and apply the terms &ldquo;horizontal intercept,&rdquo; &ldquo;vertical intercept,&rdquo; &ldquo;maximum,&rdquo; and &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; when talking about functions and their graphs.</li>
  <li>Identify important features of linear functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>4.6.1: Interpreting Statements in Function Notation</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In this activity, you interpreted function notation using a graph. You completed mathematical statements and found the value of variables by reading the information from a graph.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>4.6.2: Analyzing Graphs of Functions</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In this activity, you looked at the graphs of two different real-life functions. You identified key features such as minimum and maximum, \(x\)-intercepts and \(y\)-intercepts, and what they mean in a real-life situation.</li>
  <li>4.6.2: Self Check</li>
  <li>4.6.2: Additional Resources</li>
  </ul>

  <li>4.6.3: Connecting Graphical and Verbal Representations of a Function</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In this activity, you continued working with graphs, function notation, and real-life situations. You interpreted statements about a real-life graph and connected them to the function notation that represented them.</li>
  <li>4.6.3: Self Check</li>
  <li>4.6.3: Additional Resources</li>
  </ul>

  <li>4.6.4: Key Features of Linear Functions</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In this activity, you recognized the \(x\)-intercepts, zeros, slope, and \(y\)-intercepts of linear functions.</li>
  <li>4.6.4: Self Check</li>
  <li>4.6.4: Additional Resources</li>
  </ul>

  <li>4.6.5: Interpreting Graphs</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In this activity, you examined specific points and key features on the graph and interpreted their meaning verbally and algebraically.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
