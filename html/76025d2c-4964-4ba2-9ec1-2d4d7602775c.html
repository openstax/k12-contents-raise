<p><strong>Select three</strong> true statements about the situation.</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li> The rocket is launched from a height less than 20 feet above the ground. </li>
    <li> The rocket is launched from about 20 feet above the ground. </li>
    <li> The rocket reaches its maximum height after about 3 seconds. </li>
    <li> The rocket reaches its maximum height after about 160 seconds. </li>
    <li> The maximum height of the rocket is about 160 feet.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> The rocket is launched from a height less than 20 feet above the ground. The rocket reaches its maximum height after about 3 seconds. The maximum height of the rocket is about 160 feet.</p>

    <li> Is the baseball traveling at a constant speed?&nbsp;</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>No. The distance traveled is not changing at a constant speed; it is increasing over time. For example, in the first half second, it travels 1.25 meters, and in the next half second, it travels 3.75 meters. </p>
