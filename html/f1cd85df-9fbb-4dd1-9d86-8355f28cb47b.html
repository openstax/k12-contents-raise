<h4>Using Linear Models</h4>
<p>The Monopoly board game is popular in many countries. The scatter plot below shows the distance from “Go” to a property (in number of spaces moving from “Go” in a clockwise direction) and the price of the properties on the Monopoly board. The equation of the line is \(P = 8x + 40\), where \(P\) represents the price (in Monopoly dollars) and \(x\) represents the distance (in number of spaces). </p>
<p><img alt='A scatter plot that shows the "distance from go" in number of spaces on the x-axis and the price of a property in monopoly dollars on the y-axis. The line drawn increases from left to right.' height="428" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/a1dd8ae78f10fad19e82582491e9abe66a924fce" width="450"/><br/></p>
<p>The model shows that as the distance from “Go” increases, the price of the property increases.</p>
<p>The slope of the equation of the linear model is 8. This means that for every space from “Go,” the price of the property increases $8. </p>
<p>Notice this gives an estimate. The most expensive property is 39 spaces from “Go” and costs $400. The model would give the price to be \(y=8(39)+40\) or $352.</p>
<p>The model gives a difference of $48 between the estimated price using the model and the actual price.</p>
