<h4>Using Linear Models</h4>
<p>The Monopoly board game is popular in many countries. The scatter plot below shows the distance from &ldquo;Go&rdquo; to a property (in number of spaces moving from &ldquo;Go&rdquo; in a clockwise direction) and the price of the properties on the Monopoly board. The equation of the line is \(P = 8x + 40\), where \(P\) represents the price (in Monopoly dollars) and \(x\) represents the distance (in number of spaces).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The model shows that as the distance from &ldquo;Go&rdquo; increases, the price of the property increases.</p>
<p>The slope of the equation of the linear model is 8. This means that for every space from &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; the price of the property increases $8.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice this gives an estimate. The most expensive property is 39 spaces from &ldquo;Go&rdquo; and costs $400. The model would give the price to be \(y=8(39)+40\) or $352.</p>
<p>The model gives a difference of $48 between the estimated price using the model and the actual price.</p>
