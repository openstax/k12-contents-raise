<p>Review how we can gather key information about situations from graphs representing them. Display one graph from the lesson, and ask:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;How can you use the graph to determine the initial amount?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How can you tell whether the growth factor is greater than 1 or less than 1?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How can you use the graph to determine the growth factor?&rdquo;</li>
  <li><span>&ldquo;Once you know the initial amount and the growth factor, how can you construct an equation to represent the relationship?&rdquo;</span></li>
</ul>
