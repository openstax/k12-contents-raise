<p>Review how we can gather key information about situations from graphs representing them. Display one graph from the lesson, and ask:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;How can you use the graph to determine the initial amount?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How can you tell whether the growth factor is greater than 1 or less than 1?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How can you use the graph to determine the growth factor?&rdquo;</li>
  <li><span>&ldquo;Once you know the initial amount and the growth factor, how can you construct an equation to represent the relationship?&rdquo;</span></li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
