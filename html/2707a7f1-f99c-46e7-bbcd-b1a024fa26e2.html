<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students who used different strategies to share their thinking, especially those who made use of the structure of the inequalities. If no students found solution sets by thinking about the features of the inequalities, demonstrate the reasoning process with one or two examples. For instance:</p>
<p>\(6x\leq3x\): After finding \(x=0\) as the solution to \(6x=3x\), we can reason that for \(6x\) to be less than \(3x\), \(x\) must include negative numbers, so the solution must be \(x&le;0\).</p>
<p>\(\frac{4x-1}{3}&gt;-1\): After finding \(x=-\frac12\) as the solution to the related equation \(\frac{4x-1}{3}=-1\), we can reason that as \(x\) gets smaller, \(\frac{4x-1}{3}&gt;-1\) is also going to get smaller. For that expression to be greater than \(-1\), \(x\) will have be to greater than \(-\frac12\).</p>
<p>If time permits, ask students to choose a different inequality and try reasoning this way about its solution.</p>
