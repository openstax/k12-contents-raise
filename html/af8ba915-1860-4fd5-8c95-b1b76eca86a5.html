<p>Companies like The Ensemble Theatre use quadratic equations on a regular basis and find value in using multiple methods to solve them. In addition to completing the square, another method is the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is useful for solving quadratic equations that may not be conveniently solved by completing the square. It also provides a set formula method that can be used to solve any quadratic equation.</p>
<p>When going through these lessons, you will begin by becoming familiar with the quadratic formula. You will then examine common errors that people make when using the quadratic formula as well as methods for checking and justifying your solutions to the quadratic equations.</p>
<p>This section includes two lessons:</p>
