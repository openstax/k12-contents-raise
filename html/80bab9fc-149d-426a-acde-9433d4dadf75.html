<h3>Student Activity (20 minutes)</h3>

<p>Use this information to answer questions 1 and 2.</p>
<blockquote><p>To help pay for his tuition, a college student plans to work in the evenings and on weekends. He has been offered two part-time jobs: working in the guest-services department at a hotel and waiting tables at a popular restaurant.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The job at the hotel pays $18 an hour and offers $33 in transportation allowance per month.</li>
  <li>The job at the restaurant pays $7.50 an hour plus tips. The entire wait staff typically collects about $50 in tips each hour. Tips are divided equally among the 4 wait staff members who share a shift.</li>
</ul>
<p>The equation&nbsp;\( 7.50h + \frac {50}{4}h = 18h + 33 \)&nbsp;represents a possible constraint about a situation for 1 month.</p>

          You answer may vary, but here are some samples.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Inequality 1 shows the pay at the hotel \( (18h+33) \) being greater than the pay at the restaurant \( 7.50h+ \frac{50}{4} \). Earlier, we found out that the hotel job is better when the student works less than 16.5 hours. Graph B shows \( h&lt;16.5 \). This means Graph B shows the solution to Inequality 1.</li>
            <li>If we substitute a value greater than 16.5 for \( h \), we have a true statement for Inequality 2 and a false statement for Inequality 1. This means \( h&gt;16.5 \) is a solution to Inequality 2 but not to Inequality 1.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>If we substitute a value less than 16.5 for \( h \), we have a true statement for Inequality 1 but not for Inequality 2. So \( h&lt;16.5 \) is a solution to Inequality 1.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
</ol>    
 
<h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</span></span></h3>
<p>Some students might be stymied by the fact that one of the expressions has a fractional coefficient for one of its terms. Remind these students that \( \frac{50}{4} h \). Rewriting \( \frac{50}{4} \) as a decimal may help students see this concretely.<br></p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share how they determined which job pays better for different hours of work. Display the number lines that show the solution set to each inequality.</p>
<p>If time permits, solicit some ideas from students as to why one job&mdash;the restaurant job&mdash;continues to be the more lucrative option after 16.5 hours.</p>
<p>One way to make sense of this is to compare the hourly rates at the two jobs.</p>
<p>The pay at the restaurant, \( 7.5h+\frac{50}{4}h \) could be rewritten as \( 20h \), which tells us the rate of change is $20 per hour.</p>
<p>At the hotel, the rate is $18 per hour. The $33 transportation allowance makes the total pay for this job higher up to a point, but then the higher rate of the restaurant job starts to overtake this one.</p>
<p>If we graph the monthly pay for each job (\( y=20h \) and \( y=18h+33 \)), we can see that the two graphs intersect when \(h\) is 16.5. The graph of \( y=20h \) has a lower \(y\)-value to the left of that point but a higher value to the right of it.</p>
