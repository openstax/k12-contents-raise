<h3>Optional Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>This optional activity gives students another opportunity to make sense of inequalities and their solutions in context. The context helps reinforce why it makes sense for the solutions to an inequality to be represented by a set of points on one side of a particular value on the number line. It also reiterates the idea that solving a related equation can help us find that boundary value. In the context of part-time jobs presented here, that boundary value is a break-even point at which the two options are equal. On each side of that point, one job is more lucrative than the other.</p>
<p>Students are given an expression that represents the monthly pay for \(h\) hours of work at each job. The expression for the pay at the restaurant is \(7.50h+\frac{50}{4}h\). Some students may notice that this expression could be rewritten as \(20h\) and use this simpler equivalent expression throughout the activity. Invite students who do this to share their rationale during class discussion.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Display the situation in the task statement and the equation \(7.50h+\frac{50}{4}h=18h+33\). To familiarize students with the quantities in the context, discuss:</p>
<p><span>&ldquo;What does the expression \(7.50h+\frac{50}{4}h\) represent?&rdquo; (the pay at the restaurant for \(h\) hours of work) &ldquo;What about \(18h+33\)?&rdquo; (the pay at the hotel for \(h\) hours of work)</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What does the equation tell us about the situation?&rdquo; (the student earns the same amount from both jobs for \(h\) hours of work)</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does the solution mean in this situation?&rdquo; (the number of hours of work that would enable the student to earn the same amount from either job)</p>
<p>Consider keeping students in groups of 2. Give them a few minutes of quiet work time, followed by time to discuss their responses with their partner.</p>

        <p><span><span>Some students might be stymied by the fact that one of the expressions has a fractional coefficient for one of its terms. Remind these students that \( \frac{50}{4} h \). Rewriting \( \frac{50}{4} \) as a decimal may help students see this concretely.<br></span></span></p>
        <h4><span><span>Activity Synthesis</span></span></h4>
        <p>Invite students to share how they determined which job pays better for different hours of work. Display the number lines that show the solution set to each inequality.</p>
        <p>If time permits, solicit some ideas from students as to why one job&mdash;the restaurant job&mdash;continues to be the more lucrative option after 16.5 hours.</p>
        <p>One way to make sense of this is to compare the hourly rates at the two jobs.</p>
        <p>The pay at the restaurant, \( 7.5h+\frac{50}{4}h \) could be rewritten as \( 20h \), which tells us the rate of change is $20 per hour.</p>
        <p>At the hotel, the rate is $18 per hour. The $33 transportation allowance makes the total pay for this job higher up to a point, but then the higher rate of the restaurant job starts to overtake this one.</p>
        <p>If we graph the monthly pay for each job (\( y=20h \) and \( y=18h+33 \)), we can see that the two graphs intersect when \(h\) is 16.5. The graph of \( y=20h \) has a lower \(y\)-value to the left of that point but a higher value to the right of it.</p>
