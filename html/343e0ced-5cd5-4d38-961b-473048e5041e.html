<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Since this activity was designed to be completed without technology, ask students to put away any devices.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Answer questions 1&ndash;3 about the function \(f\), given by \(f(x)=(x+3)^2&minus;1\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>What is the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of \(f\)?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> -3
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>What is the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of \(f\)?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> -1
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Does the graph open up or down?&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> The graph opens upward. The squared term has a positive coefficient (1).
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
