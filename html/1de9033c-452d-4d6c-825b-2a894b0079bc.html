<h4><span>Applications with Linear Inequalities</span></h4>
<p>Many real-life situations require us to solve inequalities. The method we will use to solve applications with linear inequalities is very much like the one we used when we solved applications with equations.</p>
<p>We will read the problem and make sure all the words are understood. Next, we will identify what we are looking for and assign a variable to represent it. We will restate the problem in one sentence to make it easy to translate into an inequality.</p>
<p><strong>Example&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Dawn won a mini-grant of $4,000 to buy tablet computers for her classroom. The tablets she would like to buy cost $254.12 each, including tax and delivery. Write an inequality to represent the maximum number of tablets Dawn can buy.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Read the problem. </p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Identify what you are looking for. <br>
  the maximum number of tablets Dawn can buy </p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Name what you are looking for. </p>
<p> Choose a variable to represent that quantity. <br>
  Let \( n= \) the number of tablets. </p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Translate. Write a sentence that gives the information to find it. </p>
<p> $254.12 times the number of tablets is no more than $4,000.<br>
  Translate into an inequality.<br>
  \( 254.12n &le; 4000 \)</p>
