<h4><span>Applications with Linear Inequalities</span></h4>
<p>Many
  real-life situations require us to solve inequalities. The method we
  will use to solve applications with linear inequalities is very much
  like the one we used when we solved applications with equations.</p>
<p>We
  will read the problem and make sure we understand all the words. Next,
  we will identify what we are looking for and assign a variable to
  represent it. We will restate the problem in one sentence to make it
  easy to translate into an inequality.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Example&nbsp;</strong><br>
</p>
<p>Dawn
  won a mini-grant of $4,000 to buy tablet computers for her classroom.
  The tablets she would like to buy cost $254.12 each, including tax and
  delivery. Write an inequality to represent the maximum number of tablets
  Dawn can buy.<br>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Here is a way to write an inequality for each situation:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>\( 2.63p &le; 20 \)</li>
<li>\( 42.75n &le; 500 \)</li>
</ol>
