<p>Invite students to name some familiar mistakes that are made when using the quadratic formula, not only those seen in the activities, but also mistakes that the students themselves might have made.</p>
<p>Then, to encourage students to think about ways of checking solutions, discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> "What might be some good ways to check if \(x=\frac{1}{3}\) and \(x=\frac{5}{2}\) are solutions to \(6x^2&minus;17x+5=0\)?" (Some possibilities: </li>
  <ul class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li> Substitute each solution into the equation and see if the equation is true. For example, see if \(6(\frac{1}{3})^2&minus;17(\frac{1}{3})+5\) equals 0. </li>
    <li> Rewrite \(6x^2&minus;17x+5=0\) in factored form: \((3x&minus;1)(2x&minus;5)=0\) and apply the zero product property to solve. </li>
    <li> Graph \(y=6x^2&minus;17x+5\) and find the \(x\)-intercepts when the graph has a \(y\)-coordinate of 0.) </li>
  </ul>
  <li> "Can completing the square be used to check the solution?" (Yes, but it is not simple because the leading coefficient is not a perfect square and the linear coefficient is an odd number.) </li>
  <li> "Suppose we want to verify if \(x= \pm \sqrt{3}\) are correct solutions to \(x^2+2x&minus;2=0\). Is substituting the expressions in the equation an effective way to check?" (In this case, substituting \(\pm \sqrt{3}\) for \(x\) makes the checking cumbersome. The expression to be evaluated would look like \((1+ \sqrt{3})^2+2(1+ \sqrt{3})&minus;2\), which is not easy to evaluate.) </li>
  <li> "What might be some good ways to check?" (We could: </li>
  <ul class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li> Solve by completing the square. The leading coefficient of \(x^2+2x&minus;2\) is 1 and the linear term coefficient is an even number, which makes it fairly simple to complete the square. </li>
    <li> Approximate the value of the solutions with a calculator, then graph \(y=x^2+2x&minus;2\) and see if the solutions match the \(x\)-intercepts.) </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
