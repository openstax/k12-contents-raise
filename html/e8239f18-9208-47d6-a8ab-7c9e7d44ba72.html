<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p  id="docs-internal-guid-7ee1640c-7fff-90ae-e83b-6eacc8011ef6">The mathematical purpose of this lesson is to understand that the relationship between variables can be, but is not always, a causal relationship. A causal relationship is one in which a change in one of the variables directly causes a change in the other variable. The work of this lesson connects to previous work because students interpreted the relationship between two variables using the correlation coefficient. The work of this lesson connects to upcoming work because students will analyze bivariate data and draw conclusions from their analysis.</p>
<p>When students determine that there is a causal relationship, they are attending to precision because they are refining their language to be more precise. When students analyze the relationship between two variables to determine whether they have a causal relationship, they are modeling with mathematics.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Describe (orally and in writing) the strength and sign of the relationship between two variables.</li>
  <li>Investigate the relationship between two variables to analyze whether or not the relationship is causal.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Determine whether or not there is a causal relationship.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>

  <p>During this lesson, it is
      important to:</p>


  <ul>
    <li>Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see
        throughout the lesson. Encourage students to look for these words and notice
        their use and meanings.</li>
    <li>Encourage students to use key vocabulary words in &ldquo;math talk&rdquo; and
        their written and oral explanations.</li>
    <li>Utilize a word wall. Sample cards
        are located here: <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/8ed3aa68763498713b44d3c2e537ffe61b4755f0" target="_blank">Mathematics Vocabulary Word Wall Cards</a></li>
