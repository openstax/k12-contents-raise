<p dir="ltr">To help students synthesize the work in this lesson, display the following prompt for all to see: &ldquo;How does solving the equation \( 4x&minus;3=12(x+3) \) help with solving the inequality \( 4x&minus;3&ge;12(x+3) \)?&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ask students to explain in their own words and in writing. If time permits, ask students to share their response with a partner, and then invite a student or two to share with the class a particularly clear explanation their partner has written.</p>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
