<br/>
<p>\(x \le 6\) means that the solution would be any number less than or equal to 6.<br/>
The graph would have a filled in circle on the number 6, because it can be equal to 6. The arrow would point to infinity on the left of the 6, because it is less than 6.</p>
<p>For questions 3 – 4, use the following information:</p>
<blockquote><p>Scooter rental company A charges $9 per hour plus a $11 initiation fee. Scooter rental company B charges $15 per hour.</p></blockquote>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
<li>A customer writes the following inequality to represent the situation: \(9h + 11 &gt; 15h\).</li>
</ol>
<p>Which of the following is true about the given inequality?</p>
<ul>
<li>Company A costs more than Company B.</li>
<li>Company A costs less than Company B.</li>
<li>Company A costs the same as Company B.</li>
<li>\( h \) represents the number of scooters rented.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>: Company A costs more than Company B.</p>
<p>Substitute the number 1 in for \(h\) to see how much it would cost to rent a scooter for 1 hour.<br/>
    \(9(1)+11 \gt 15(1)\)<br/>
    \(20 \lt 5\)<br/>
  To rent a scooter for 1 hour, it costs $20 from Company A and $15 from Company B. Company A costs more than Company B.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
<li>For which number of hours does Company B cost less?
    <ul>
<li>1 hour</li>
<li>2 hours</li>
<li>3 hours</li>
<li>4 hours</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer :</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>
  Substitute the number 1 in for \(h\) to see how much it would cost to rent a scooter for 1 hour.<br/>
  Company A: \(9(1)+11=$20 \)<br/>
  Company B: \(15(1)=$15 \)<br/>
  To rent a scooter for 1 hour, it costs $20 from Company A and $15 from Company B.   
</p>
<p>
  Substitute the number 2 in for \(h\) to see how much it would cost to rent a scooter for 2 hours.<br/>
  Company A: <br/>
  \(9(2)+11=$29\)<br/>
  Company B: \(15(2)=$30\)<br/>
To rent a scooter for 2 hours, it costs $29 from Company A and $30 from Company B.
</p>
<p>
    Substitute the number 3 in for \(h\) to see how much it would cost to rent a scooter for 3 hours.<br/>
    Company A: \(9(3)+11=$38\)<br/>
    Company B: \(15(3)=$45\)<br/>
To rent a scooter for 3 hours, it costs $38 from Company A and $45 from Company B.
</p>
<p>
  Substitute the number 4 in for \(h\) to see how much it would cost to rent a scooter for 4 hours.<br/>
  Company A: \(9(4)+11=$47\)<br/>
  Company B: \(15(4)=$60\)<br/>
  To rent a scooter for 4 hours, it costs $47 from Company A and $60 from Company B.
</p>
<p>Company B costs the least for 1 hour.</p>
<p>For questions 5 – 7, use the following information:<br/><br/>
<blockquote><p>Cycle Rentals offers 20 membership points for each day that a customer rents a bike. Bikes Unlimited offers 5 membership points for each day that a customer rents a bike plus 60 points for joining the membership club.</p></blockquote>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
<li>The equation \( 20x = 5x + 60 \) represents a possible constraint about the situation.<br/>
      Solve for \(x\).<br/>
      \(x =\)  __<u>?</u>__
  </li>
</ol>
<div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The correct answer is 4.</p>
<p>
  \(20x=5x+60\)<br/> 
  \(15x=60\)<br/> 
  \(x=4 \) <br/>
</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
<li>Which shop offers more membership points if you rent a bike for longer than the constraint you found in the previous question?</li>
<ul>
<li>Cycle Rentals</li>
<li>Bikes Unlimited</li>
<br/>
</ul>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Cycle Rentals</p>
<p>
  The constraint from question 5 is \(x=4\). <br/>
  Since a number larger than 4 is needed to determine which shop offers more membership points if you rent a bike for longer than the constraint, choose to substitute in the number 5 for \(x\) to calculate how many membership points can be earned in 5 days.<br/>
  Cycle Rentals: \(20x=20(5)=100\) membership points<br/>
  Bikes Unlimited: \(5x+60=5(5)+60=25+60=85\) membership points <br/>

  Solve for \(x\).<br/>
  \(20x \gt 5x+60\) <br/> 
  \(15x \gt 60 \)<br/>
  \(x \gt 4\) <br/> 
The graph will have an open circle at 4, since the solution can not be equal to 4, with the arrow pointing to infinity to the right because the solution is greater than 4.
