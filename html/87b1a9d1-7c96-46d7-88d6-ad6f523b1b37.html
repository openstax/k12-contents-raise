<h3>Warm Up Activity&nbsp;</h3>
<p><span>In an earlier lesson, you saw the equation </span><span class="math math-repaired">\( V + F - 2 = E \)</span><span>, which relates the number of vertices, faces, and edges in a Platonic solid.</span><br></p>

<p>1. Write an equation that makes it easier to find the number of vertices in each of the Platonic solids described:</p>

<p>3. A Buckminsterfullerene (also called a &ldquo;Buckyball&rdquo;) is a polyhedron with 60 vertices. It is not a Platonic solid, but the numbers of faces, edges, and vertices are related the same way as those in a Platonic solid.
    </p>
<p>Write an equation that makes it easier to find the number of faces a Buckyball has if we know how many edges it has.
