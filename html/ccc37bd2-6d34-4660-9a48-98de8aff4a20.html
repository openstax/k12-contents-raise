<h3>Cool Down Activity (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Encourage and support opportunities for peer interactions. Invite students to talk about their ideas with a partner before writing them down.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Student Facing Statement </h4>
<p>A travel company uses a quadratic function to model the profit, in dollars, that it expects to earn from selling tickets to a river cruise at \(d\) dollars per person. The expression \(-d^2+100d&minus;900\) defines this function.</p>
<p>Without graphing, find the price that would generate the maximum profit. Then, determine that maximum profit.</p>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<p>The price of $50 per ticket would generate a maximum profit of $1600. \(-d^2+100d&minus;900\) can be rewritten in vertex form as \(-(d&minus;50)^2+1600\), so the vertex of the graph is at \((50,1600)\). This means the maximum profit, $1600, can be expected when tickets are priced at $50 each.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite one or more students to demonstrate their solution, or if they got stuck, demonstrate the progress that they made.</p>
<h4>Lesson Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to create a visual display of one of their solutions to one of the tasks. Then, display these around the room and provide each student with a few sticky notes. Invite them to observe one or more of their classmates' solutions, and leave a sticky note if they have a question or observation to share. After this gallery walk, allow students time to review the feedback they received on their display and invite students to share anything new they learned or questions they have after seeing some of their classmates' work.</p>
