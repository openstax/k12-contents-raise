<p>Mr. Das is a scientist trying to reduce our overall energy consumption by creating a more efficient battery for our mobile devices and electric cars. He can use functions to calculate and observe the changes that affect battery efficiency and cause more power loss. Graphing functions that represent situations can help him analyze and compare the results.</p>
<p>In this section, you will analyze graphs and relate features of graphs to features of the function. You will use statements in function notation to talk about key features of a graph. You will deepen your understanding of functions by comparing several functions, analyzing two or more graphs simultaneously, and studying comparative statements in function notation.</p>
