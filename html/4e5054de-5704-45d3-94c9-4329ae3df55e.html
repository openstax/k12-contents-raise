<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here is a sequence: 500, 100, 20, . . .</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>
    <p>Explain why this sequence could be a geometric sequence.</p>
  </li>
  <p> <strong>Answer: </strong> The given terms have a common ratio. \(100=\frac15\cdot 500\), and \(20=\frac15\cdot 100\).</p>
  <li>
    <p>What is the next term?</p>
  </li>
  <p> <strong>Answer: </strong> \(20 \cdot \frac15 = 4\)</p>
  <li>
    <p>Explain how you know the next term.</p>
  </li>
  <p> <strong>Answer: </strong> Multiplying a term by the common ratio gives the next term.</p>
</ol>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5> More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
