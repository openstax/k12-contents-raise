<h4>Types of Assessments </h4>
<p>As students complete assignments in this course, they encounter different types of assessment tasks. The questions that populate these assessments address varying levels of rigor as identified by <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/f5c7b75ca0ba28e85ee262453e3196a3c618d163" target="_blank">Costa’s  levels of questioning:</a> </p>
<ul>
<li>Gathering  (level 1) - questions that focus on recall and basic procedures</li>
<li>Processing (level 2) - questions that require combining facts, discerning patterns, and sense-making</li>
<li>Applying (level 3) - questions that invite abstract thinking and synthesizing information from multiple sources</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether the assessment item assesses the full rigor level of the TEKS or only a portion of the TEKS depends upon the type of the assessment and its location within the learning progression for each lesson or unit </p>
<br/>
<br/>
<h4>Diagnostic Assessments </h4>
<p>Upon first entering a unit, students and teachers have an opportunity to assess student understanding of the prerequisite content needed for success in the unit:</p>
<div class="os-raise-accordion">
<!-- Accordion Item 1-->
<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
<button class="os-raise-accordion-header">Overview and Readiness Questions</button>
<div class="os-raise-accordion-content">
<p>The <strong>Overview and Readiness section</strong>  within each unit contains a three-item assessment aligned to prerequisite skills students should have mastered in prior grade levels or previous units. 
            </p>
<ul>
<li>If a student incorrectly answers one of the questions in the assessment, they are automatically pushed to a mini-lesson and additional practice opportunities covering the topic for that item. 
                </li>
<li>If a student answers an item correctly, they move on to the next item or to the end of the overview and readiness section if that is the last item of the assessment. 
                </li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, if you wish to direct students to a specific mini-lesson topic, have students use the right-navigation menu for the lesson.</p>
<p>The following image illustrates a question from the Unit 2 Overview and Readiness Quiz. Notice the right-navigation Lesson menu that students can use to move between the pages and access the mini-lessons.</p>
<img alt="A screenshot from the curriculum showing an example assessment item that measures student understanding of prerequisite skills. To the right of the multiple choice question, the image includes the navigation menu that can be used to access mini-lessons about the prerequisite skills." class="os-raise-media-responsive" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/5642e5d322c65198f93677ff4090ffb5fe4f4f21"/>
<br/> <br/>
<p>Also, recall that additional information regarding the vertical alignment of TEKS for each unit is provided within each unit level teacher guide. The Unit Resources section on this guide contains further suggestions for supplementary content that may be useful in supporting student gaps identified by the Overview and Readiness diagnostic tool or your own observations. </p>
<p>The following image depicts the section of the Unit Resources available on the Unit Teacher Guide. </p>
<img alt='A screenshot from the curriculum showing a section of the teacher overview page titled Unit Resources. The items listed include "Vertical Alignment for Unit 2," "Pre-Algebra Resources from OpenStax," and "Assessments."' class="os-raise-media-responsive" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b2e3f5ca0127f5c98008e02c54c93369c8407031"/>
<br/> <br/>
<p>The prerequisite items in the  Overview and Readiness  section have been written to check student understanding and mastery of prior topics. So, while they measure student proficiency at a mastery level, the content comes from material students should already be familiar with and know. These items are all multiple choice, so they can automatically trigger a student pathway towards mini-lesson refreshers if the student answers incorrectly. </p>
<p><em>Focused on gathering and processing, these items assess student mastery at the full rigor level of the TEKS from previous grade levels or units. </em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The goal for these unit-level diagnostic assessments is to help both students and teachers pre-assess topics and skills that students need to successfully complete the unit. Information from this assessment can be used to identify needed topics for in-lesson scaffolds, small group instruction, tutoring, etc. </p>
<p>An additional set of assessments intended to provide teachers with information at the lesson level is also available. The purpose of these instruments is to more formally help teachers monitor student progress and identify student preparedness for the lesson content using a variety of question types and item styles. </p>
<p>These materials, when encountered before the denoted lesson, support access to the lesson and identify potential areas where additional support may be required.</p>

<h4>Formative Assessments </h4>
<p>Within a lesson, students and teachers have multiple opportunities to formatively assess student understanding of the content including: </p>
<ul>
<li>Activity page questions
    </li>
<li>Self Check questions</li>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
<div class="os-raise-accordion">
<!-- Accordion Item 1-->
<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
<button class="os-raise-accordion-header">Activity Page Questions</button>
<div class="os-raise-accordion-content">
<p>As students engage with a lesson, they experience a Warm Up activity followed by either a teacher-led mini-lesson or they may have been directed by their teacher to a specific set of Additional Resources.</p>
<p>To assess student understanding of the content in the mini-lesson or Additional Resources, students engage in primary learning activities. The primary <strong> Activity pages</strong> within each lesson are where students first encounter formative assessments to check their understanding. </p>
<p>On Activity pages, students complete questions and have the opportunity to immediately compare their responses with the feedback provided. The questions and feedback are designed for students to formatively assess their own understanding. Therefore, these questions are not graded nor reported to the gradebook, so that students are not penalized for mistakes during their learning journey. The Activity pages offer students risk free practice.  </p>
<p>Once students have entered the lessons, they encounter Activity questions, Self Check items, and Practice problems. Activity questions often begin with questions that do not address the full rigor expectations of the learning standard since they are inviting students into mathematical learning or providing access to the context. The questions may tap into content that is relevant to students in an effort to spark interest and grow into measures of parts or portions of the TEKS. </p>
<p>The following image is from a lesson in Unit 1. Notice how the questions invite students into the learning context through the use of questions about their own opinions or preferences about pizza. </p>
<img alt="A screenshot from the curriculum showing a lesson where students are asked to plan a pizza party. The initial questions ask students to describe their favorite types of pizza." class="os-raise-media-responsive" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/5e37091edee4816285f75ba446c030ba7ca05fd5"/>
<br/> <br/>
<p>Since these questions are formative and help to build student understanding, they guide students through the thinking processes needed to master the full TEKS rigor expectation. </p>
<p><em>Focused on gathering, the  Activity  questions ask students to classify, identify, describe, discuss, explain or list answers to solutions that address portions or all of the TEKS expectations. Some of these questions are multiple choice, but most often they are student-generated responses (text entry, equation entry, numeric entry, graph). These question sets also include opportunities for students to engage with question types that include multi-select, drag and drop, drop down/incline choice, etc.</em></p>
<p>The following image depicts student progression from identifying one variable that could be used in the scenario to a full expression using that variable, followed by a description of the expression in words. This exemplifies how students are expected to provide not only the requested expressions or equations, but also verbally describe what they mean. </p>
<img alt="A screenshot from the curriculum showing the cool down for a lesson where students are asked to plan an ice cream party. The students are encouraged to use the skills they learned in previous activities where they planned a pizza party." class="os-raise-media-responsive" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b11b6dc6027ff8bd74cdf38d98c5f012167d8d1e"/>
<br/><br/>
<p>In another example of Activity questions, students are required to demonstrate their answer by entering a graph into the embedded technology.</p>

</div>
</div>
<!-- Accordion Item 2-->
<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
<button class="os-raise-accordion-header">Self Check Questions</button>
<div class="os-raise-accordion-content">
<p>At the conclusion of each learning activity, students complete a <strong>Self Check question</strong>. This is the second type of formative assessment students encounter along their learning path. Upon submission of their answer, students receive immediate feedback regarding their response. </p>
<ul>
<li>If a student incorrectly answers the question in the assessment, they are automatically pushed to the Additional Resources page and additional practice opportunities covering the topic for that item. </li>
<li>If a student answers the item correctly, they move on to the next primary learning Activity or to the Cool Down for the lesson if that is the last learning Activity. </li>
<li>To reinforce the formative nature of this item,  I am not sure  is always an answer choice option for students to select. This answer choice will always progress students to the Additional Resources' page for additional review and learning opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p>After reviewing the Additional Resources page for a missed item, students are provided with the opportunity to retry the Self Check question or proceed to the next primary learning Activity. </p>
<p><strong>Self Check items</strong> assess understanding of the specific TEKS breakout expectation that was addressed in the Activity. Thus, they rarely assess the full rigor expectation of the TEKS, but fully assess the breakout objective of the TEKS from the primary lesson Activity. If students incorrectly answer the question, they are automatically moved into a set of Additional Resources that can be used to refresh student understanding. Thus, these questions are always multiple choice including the option for  I am not sure.  </p>
<p>Notice in the example provided from Unit 1, students are asked to select the one-variable algebraic expression described by the scenario. This is a skill objective leading students to the full TEKS that expects students to write linear equations in two variables from a verbal description. </p>
<img alt="A screenshot from the curriculum showing a math assessment item where students identify an expression for a scenario given in a verbal description." class="os-raise-media-responsive" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/d3ed55faa4791f6cbf9b7d91a35a90bc29fecc14"/>
<br/> <br/>
<p>Focused on processing, the  Self-Check  questions ask students to choose, execute, solve, interpret, use, and examine specific objectives of the TEKS. These questions are strictly multiple choice since incorrect answers trigger an automated  push  to  Additional Resources  that include instructional notes, additional practice opportunities, and video explanations. </p>
</div>
</div>
<!-- Accordion Item 3-->
<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
<button class="os-raise-accordion-header">Practice Problems</button>
<div class="os-raise-accordion-content">
<p>After students complete all of the learning  Activity  pages and  Self Check  questions for a lesson, they participate in a  Cool Down  activity before finally encountering a set of  Practice  problems. Practice problems have been designed to provide a no-risk opportunity for students to practice all of the content from the lesson. Each set of  Practice  problems consists of approximately ten questions and permits students with multiple opportunities to attempt the questions. </p>
<ul>
<li>If a student incorrectly answers a practice problem, they are automatically provided feedback that identifies the part of the lesson from which the question originates. 
                    <ul>
<li>Students have an opportunity to go back to the identified  Additional Resources  page to refresh their thinking before trying the problem again.
                        </li>
<li>If they reach the maximum number of attempts, feedback on how to correctly solve the problem is provided.
                        </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a student answers the item correctly, they receive immediate feedback which they can use to compare with their own thinking and solution process before proceeding to the next problem.
                </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Practice problems</strong> help students and teachers assess student understanding of the TEKS for the full lesson. As a result, they assess the full rigor expectation of the identified TEKS while varying in the way the questions are asked. In some lessons, only a partial breakout of the TEKS may be expected, but in other lessons, the full TEKS expectation may be addressed. Access the  Teacher Guide  for the lesson to identify the specific TEKS or TEKS breakout that is being addressed in the  Practice  problems. 
            </p>
<p>The provided example illustrates different types of problems that students are asked to complete. For this set of practice problems, students encounter a multiple choice question, a multi-select question, and a dropdown answer choice. Also notice that the number of attempts is indicated for students.</p>
<img alt="A screenshot from the curriculum showing a variety of types of questions provided to students. The questions included in this image are multiple choice, multi-select, and dropdown item types." class="os-raise-media-responsive" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/04ff73c6ffe10f4f22f9ee701591ad9fee709bc8"/>
<br/><br/>
<p><em>Focusing on processing, the Practice questions ask students to write, generalize, defend, check, select, and predict answers for problems that address portions or all of the student expectations of the TEKS for the lesson. Some of these questions are multiple choice, but they also include equation entry, numeric entry, graph, multi-select, drop down/inline choice, etc.
            </em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<br/>
<p>Questions contained within the Activity pages,Self Checks, and Practice problems include options such as: multiple choice, multi-select, self-generated response (text, numeric, and equation), graphing, and drop down/inline choice. Activity pages that include Desmos learning activities provide opportunities for students to engage with questions that contain drag and drop responses as well as “hotspot”  question types. 
</p>
<p>The goal for these formative assessments is to allow students the chance to participate in risk-free practice. Because scores and responses are not reported to the gradebook for these assessments, incorrect answers become learning opportunities. Multiple attempts, targeted feedback, and answers displaying the solution steps provide scaffolding for students who struggle with the content. Teachers are encouraged to use Running Rosters or Anecdotal Notes to identify specific questions or topics that students struggle with or to capture words and phrases students use to correctly or incorrectly discuss their responses. </p>
<br/><br/>
<h4>Summative Assessments </h4>
<p>Within a unit, teachers have multiple opportunities to summatively assess student understanding of the content.  These opportunities include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Section Quiz
    </li>
<li>Unit Quiz
    </li>
<li>STAAR Review Quiz, Unit Level
    </li>
<li>STAAR Review Quiz, Semester Level
    </li>
<li>Projects
    </li>
</ul>
<div class="os-raise-accordion">
<!-- Accordion Item 1-->
<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
<button class="os-raise-accordion-header">Section Quiz</button>
<div class="os-raise-accordion-content">
<p>Each unit has been divided into sections that contain a specific skill or knowledge set that feeds the learning progression for the unit. Typically, these sections contain 4-5 lessons. At the conclusion of each section, teachers may choose to have students complete a <strong> Section Quiz</strong>.  </p>
<p>Each  Section Quiz  typically contains five questions and strictly focuses on the content within that section. Students are provided immediate feedback once their quiz is submitted, and the quiz grade is recorded in the platform gradebook. </p>

<button class="os-raise-accordion-header">Unit Quiz</button>
<div class="os-raise-accordion-content">
<!-- Content goes here -->
<p>At the conclusion of each unit, a  <strong>Unit Quiz</strong> assesses student understanding of all topics within a unit. The questions cover TEKS and content from each section of the unit. Typically, the  Unit Quiz consists of twelve questions. Students are provided immediate feedback once their quiz is submitted, and the grade is recorded in the platform gradebook.
            </p>

<!-- Accordion Item 3-->
<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
<button class="os-raise-accordion-header">STAAR Review Quiz, Unit Level</button>
<div class="os-raise-accordion-content">
<!-- Content goes here -->
<p>A <strong>STAAR Review Quiz</strong> is provided for each unit and consists of approximately ten questions. While the first half of the quiz focuses on content from the current unit, the last half of the quiz pulls from content in previous units. In this manner, the  STAAR Review Quiz  provides an on-going, spiral review of the content reinforcing the evidence-based strategy of <strong> spaced retrieval</strong>. The questions on the  STAAR Review Quizzes  have all been selected from released STAAR End of Course Algebra 1 items from the Texas Education Agency [TEA]. A blueprint of all items for each unit is provided in the  Unit Resources  within each  Unit Teacher Guide. 
            </p>

<div class="os-raise-accordion-content">
<!-- Content goes here -->
<p>Two forms of both the <strong> Fall STAAR Review Quiz</strong> and <strong> Spring STAAR Review Quiz</strong> are provided for use after units 5 and 9, respectively. Approximately twenty questions in length, the items for these quizzes consist of released STAAR End of Course Algebra 1 items from the TEA and focus on the  Readiness Standards  from units 1-5 and units 6-9. 
            </p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>For all quiz types, students may choose to take a quiz again with all data recorded for each separate attempt. Because teachers have all of the data each time a student retakes a quiz, they have options as to how they want to use the grades to reflect student proficiency. </p>
<ul>
<li>The goal of each  <strong> Section Quiz</strong>  is to provide teachers with vital,  just in time  information about student mastery of a specific link in the learning progression for the whole unit. Teachers can use this information to facilitate small group instruction or provide additional scaffolds as students progress to the next section. 
    </li>
<li>The goal of each <strong>Unit Quiz</strong>  is to provide teachers and students with a culminating assessment of student understanding for the full learning progression of the unit. 
    </li>
<li>The goal of each <strong>unit level STAAR Review Quiz</strong> is to provide teachers and students with a spaced retrieval assessment opportunity using exact STAAR items. 
    </li>
<li>The goal of each <strong>semester level STAAR Review Quiz</strong> is to provide teachers and students with a summative assessment that spans content across multiple units. 
    </li>
</ul>
<p>All <strong>quiz items</strong>, whether they cover section content ( Section Quiz ), unit content ( Unit Quiz ), or full course content ( STAAR Quiz ), seek to summatively assess student understanding of multiple parts of a TEKS (breakout expectations) or a full TEKS. Access the Teacher Guide for the lessons and unit to identify the specific TEKS or TEKS breakout addressed in the Quiz problems. 
</p>
<p><em>Focused on processing, the quiz questions ask students to choose, execute, solve, interpret, use, and examine answers to problems that address the full rigor of the TEKS or specified breakouts of the TEKS. These questions are strictly multiple choice.</em></p>
<div class="os-raise-accordion">
<!-- Accordion Item 1-->
<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
<button class="os-raise-accordion-header">Unit Project</button>
<div class="os-raise-accordion-content">
<p>Finally, teachers can use the <strong>culminating Project</strong>  provided at the end of each unit as an alternate assessment. These projects require students to apply the TEKS for the unit to a real world or mathematical scenario. As a result, the content lends itself towards being more open ended and permits student choice. </p>
<p>The goal of the Projects  is to provide students an alternative way to demonstrate mastery of the content while sparking interest and engagement through real world and mathematical applications. </p>
<p>The culminating <strong>Project</strong>  for each unit poses a real-world or mathematical scenario for students to investigate or solve. Not only do these assessments of learning address the full expectation of the TEKS in the unit, but it does so in a way that allows students to address the full range of the  process standards.  
            </p>
<p>In the example provided below, students are asked to select tools to gather and record data about the length of their classmates’ arms. They use this information to draw conclusions, make predictions, and communicate their findings about the remains uncovered by an archeologist. 
            </p>

<br/><br/>
<p><em>Focused on applying, the  Project  questions ask students to assemble, design, plan, formulate, produce, argue, develop, construct, devise, make, and predict solutions to problems that address the TEKS for the unit. All of these questions are student-generated responses that are completed on paper-pencil (outside of the digital learning environment). </em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<br/><br/>
<h4>Suggestions for Implementation and Administration </h4>
<p>Because the content in this course is designed to be a learning tool for students, the students automatically have access to all of the activities, self checks, quizzes, and projects. This access also includes the opportunity to take the quizzes repeatedly. The focus of this approach is to maximize student ownership of the learning process - including assessments. </p>
<p>Teachers should use the assessments in this course as a way to train students how to use formative and summative assessments to track their own level of understanding. To support this work, each unit contains a  Student Self-Assessment  tool to assist students with reflecting on their understanding of the learning targets. The Student Self Assessment tools are located on the Unit Wrap Up page in the student pages. </p>
<p>The image below is an example of the Student Self Assessment tool available for students to use as they reflect on what they have learned in each unit. </p>
<p class="os-raise-text-center"><img alt="A screenshot from the curriculum showing a student self-assessment form." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b7e94339d9c91c4f176fb6bde1b352393e42881d" width="450"/></p>
