<p>This Algebra 1 curriculum is authored by OpenStax and is fully aligned to the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS). It is based, in part, on the IM 6–12 Math™ by Illustrative Mathematics®. (IM). In order to provide support for language development, the IM content adapted work done by Understanding Language at Stanford University. For the original paper, Guidance for Math Curricula Design and Development, please visit https://ul.stanford.edu/resource/principles-design-mathematics-curricula.</p>

<p>This curriculum builds on foundational principles for supporting language development for all students. Within lessons, you&rsquo;ll find gray boxes which provide evidence-based strategies and routines to support English language learners.</p>

<p>Each lesson includes instructional strategies that teachers can use to facilitate access to the language demands of a lesson or activity. These strategies, labeled Support for English Language Learners, stem from the design principles and are aligned to the language domains of reading, writing, speaking, listening, conversing, and representing in math (Aguirre &amp; Bunch, 2012). They provide students with access to mathematics by supporting them with the language demands of a specific activity without reducing the mathematical demands of the task. Using these supports will help maintain student engagement in mathematical communication and ensure that student struggle remains productive.</p>
<p>The gray boxes guide teachers to recognize and support students' language development in the context of mathematical sense-making. Embedded within the curriculum are instructional routines and practices to help teachers address the specialized academic language demands in math when planning and delivering lessons, including the demands of reading, writing, speaking, listening, conversing, and representing in math (Aguirre &amp; Bunch, 2012).</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Each gray box (in the teacher&rsquo;s guide, activity within a lesson) will say either Support for English Language Learners or Support for Students with Disabilities.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mathematical Language Routines:  Each support uses one of the MLRs created to amplify, assess, and develop students' language. Each of these routines are described in detail later in the teacher&rsquo;s guide along with student supports and videos.
  </li>
  <li>
    Language Domains: Each of the language domains supported by this activity will be listed: representing listening, conversing, reading or writing. As described earlier, each language domain aligns to an ELP standard.
  </li>
  <li>
    Design Principles: Each support has been aligned to one or more of the four design principles. You can learn more about each design principle in the following sections.
