<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity reinforces the idea that the solutions to a system of inequalities can be effectively represented by a region on the graphs of the inequalities in the system. The activity is designed to be completed without the use of graphing technology.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Ask students to put away any devices.</p>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<p>Members of a high school math club have a scavenger hunt. Three items are hidden in the park, which is a rectangle that measures 50 meters by 20 meters.</p>
<ul>
<li>The clues are written as systems of inequalities. One system has no solutions.</li>
<li>The locations of the items can be narrowed down by solving the systems. A coordinate plane can be used to describe the solutions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Can you find the hidden items? Sketch a graph to show where each item could be hidden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For each clue, graph each inequality separately on the same coordinate grid.</p>
<p><strong>Clue 1:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>\(y&gt;14\)<br><span>\(x&lt;10\)</span><br></p>

<p dir="ltr">Reflect: When you graphed each pair of inequalities, you created a system of inequalities. Where did the possible solutions lie on the graph?</p><br>
<h4>Student-Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Two non-negative numbers \(x\) and \(y\) satisfy \(x+y\leq1\).</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Find a second inequality, also using \(x\) and \(y\) values greater than or equal to zero, to make a system of inequalities with exactly one solution.</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Find as many ways to answer this question as you can.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Extension Student Response</h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Sample response: \(y\geq1\). Other responses include \(x\geq1\) and any inequality of the form \(y\leq ax\), where \(a\) is negative.</span></p><br>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Some students may have trouble interpreting the graph of the fourth system, wondering if a point in either of the shaded regions on the graph could be where an item is hidden. Ask them to pick a point on the graph and consider whether it satisfies the first inequality, and then whether it satisfies the second inequality. Remind them that a solution to a system needs to satisfy both.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Invite students to share their graphs and strategies for finding the solution regions. In particular, discuss how they found out which system had no solutions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remind students that a system of linear equations has no solutions if the graphs of the equations are two parallel lines that never intersect. Explain that a system of linear inequalities has no solutions if their regions are bound by two parallel lines and the solution region of each one is on the &ldquo;outside&rdquo; of the parallel lines, as is the case with the last given system.</p>

<h4>Solve a System of Linear Inequalities by Graphing</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The solution to a single linear inequality is the region on one side of the boundary line that contains all the points that make the inequality true. The solution to a system of two linear inequalities is a region that contains the solutions to both inequalities. To find this region, we will graph each inequality separately and then locate the region where they are both true. The solution is always shown as a graph.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Solve the system by graphing:&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">\(\left\{\begin{array}{l}y\geq2x-1\\y&lt;x+1\end{array}\right.\)</p>
