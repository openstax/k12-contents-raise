<p>In this lesson, you will review exponent properties when dividing by monomials. You will also learn multiple methods to divide a polynomial by a binomial. You will master a method to determine the remainder of a division problem involving polynomials, as well as a method to determine if a binomial is a factor of a larger polynomial. You will also gain fluency in dividing polynomials as functions.</p>
<p>Polynomials are frequently used in calculating physics problems and other real-world situations involving projectiles and the motion of objects. Mastering the polynomial operations in this unit will help you in future studies.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Divide monomials. </li>
