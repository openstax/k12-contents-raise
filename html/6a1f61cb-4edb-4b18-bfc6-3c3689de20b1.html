<p>All students are individuals who can know, use, and enjoy mathematics. These materials empower students with activities that capitalize on their existing strengths and abilities to ensure that all learners can participate meaningfully in rigorous mathematical content. Lessons support a flexible approach to instruction and provide teachers with options for additional support to address the needs of a diverse group of students.</p>

  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> Lesson Structures are Consistent</button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>The structure of every lesson is the same: &ldquo;warm up,&rdquo; &ldquo;activities,&rdquo; &ldquo;synthesis,&rdquo; &ldquo;cool-down.&rdquo; By keeping the components of each lesson similar from day to day, the flow of work in class becomes predictable for students. This structure similarity reduces cognitive demand and enables students to focus on the mathematics at hand rather than the mechanics of the lesson.</p>

  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> Concepts Develop from Concrete to Abstract</button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>Mathematical concepts are introduced simply, concretely, and repeatedly, with complexity and abstraction developing over time. Students begin with concrete examples and transition to diagrams and tables before relying exclusively on symbols to represent the mathematics they encounter.</p>

  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> Individual to Pair, or Small Group to Whole Class Progression</button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>Providing students with time to think through a situation or question independently before engaging with others allows students to carry the weight of learning, with support arriving just in time from the community of learners. This progression will enable students to activate what they already know and continue to build from this base with others.</p>

<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> Opportunities to Apply Mathematics to Real-World </button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>Giving students opportunities to apply the mathematics they learn clarifies and deepens their understanding of core math concepts and skills and provides motivation and support. Mathematical modeling is a powerful activity for all students, especially students with disabilities. Each unit has a culminating activity designed to explore, integrate, and apply all the units&rsquo; big ideas. Centering instruction on these contextual situations can provide students with disabilities an anchor on which to base their mathematical understandings.</p>
