<p>In this activity, whenever you see 💬, stop and share your responses with your partner. If you have different responses, try to come to a consensus.</p>
<p>For 1 - 8, use the following instructions.</p>
<blockquote>Use the simulation screen labeled “Explore”. Note you can switch between simulation screens using the toolbar located below the area model.</blockquote>

<p><li>Explain what the red and blue sliders do to the outside of the rectangle. </li>
<p><li>Explain what the red and blue sliders do to the inside of the rectangle.</li>
<p><li>Describe what changes and what doesn’t change when the red and blue sliders are moved. 💬</li>
