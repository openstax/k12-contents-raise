        Incorrect. Let’s try again a different way: Watch the signs when finding the differences. The rate of

        That’s correct! Check yourself: The rate of change of a linear function is the slope, \(\frac{change\; in\;
        y}{change\; in\; x}\). The answer is -3.

        Incorrect. Let’s try again a different way: This is the reciprocal of the answer. Remember the slope is
        \(\frac{change\; in\; y}{change\; in\; x}\).The answer is -3.

<h4>Rate of Change of Linear Functions.</h4>
<p> The graph of a linear function is identical to the graph of the linear equation that describes it. The rate of
  change of a linear equation is constant. The rate of change is the slope, \(m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\)</p>

<h4> Try It: Rate of Change of Linear Functions</h4>
<p>The function \(V(x)\) gives the volume of water that flows from a faucet in gallons during 𝒙 minutes. \(V(x)\) is a
  linear function with the graph shown.What is the rate of change of the volume?</p>
<br/>

<p>Write down your answer then select the <strong>solution </strong>button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to find the rate of change of the linear function:</p>
<p>Identify two points on the graph.</p>
<p>Use \((0, 0)\) and \((7, 4)\).</p>
<p>Find the slope: </p>
<p>\(m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{4-0}{7-0}=\frac47\)</p>
<p>The slope is \(\frac47\), so, the rate of change is \(\frac47\).</p>
