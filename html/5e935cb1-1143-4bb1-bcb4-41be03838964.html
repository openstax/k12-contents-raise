<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write an equation of the line given the slope and \(y\)-intercept.</li>
<li>Write an equation of the line given the slope and a point.</li>
<li>Write an equation of the line given two points.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.12.1: Using the Slope Formula<ul>
<li>In this activity, you reviewed using the slope formula to find the slope between two points.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1.12.2: Writing an Equation Given the Slope and \(y\)-Intercept<ul>
<li>In this activity, you used the given slope and \(y\)-intercept to write the equation of a line in slope-intercept form. You also worked to find the slope and \(y\)-intercept from a graph to then write the equation of the line in slope-intercept form.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1.12.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>
<li>1.12.3: Writing an Equation Given the Slope and a Point&nbsp;<ul>
<li>In this activity, you used point-slope form to write the equation of a line given a slope and a point. You then wrote the equation in slope-intercept form.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1.12.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>
<li>1.12.4: Write an Equation Given Two Points<ul>
<li>In this activity, you found the slope between two points and confirmed it with the slope formula. You then used one point and the slope to write the equation of a line in point-slope form. From here, you wrote the equation in slope-intercept form and used the graph to check your equation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1.12.4: Self Check&nbsp;</li>
<li>1.12.5: Choosing a Method to Write an Equation<ul>
<li>In this activity, you discussed when to use each method of writing an equation. With a partner, you worked to find slopes and equations of lines using different methods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
