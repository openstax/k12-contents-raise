<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Write an equation of the line given the slope and \(y\)-intercept.</li>
  <li>Write an equation of the line given the slope and a point.</li>
  <li>Write an equation of the line given two points.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1.12.1: Using the Slope Formula
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you reviewed using the slope formula to find the slope between two points.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    1.12.2: Writing an Equation Given the Slope and \(y\)-Intercept
    <ul>
        <li>In this activity, you used the given slope and \(y\)-intercept to write the equation of a line in slope-intercept form. You also worked to find the slope and \(y\)-intercept from a graph to then write the equation of the line in slope-intercept form.  </li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    1.12.3: Writing an Equation Given the Slope and a Point&nbsp;
  
  <ul>
    <li>In this activity, you used point-slope form to write the equation of a line given a slope and a point. You then wrote the equation in slope-intercept form.  </li>

  </ul>
  
  <li> 1.12.4: Writing Equations in Different Forms
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you reviewed three possible forms of a linear equation, slope-intercept form, point-slope form, and standard form, and how to convert between the different forms. You then wrote the equation for a line in all three different formats when given a variety of information.</li>

      <li>1.12.4: Additional Resources&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>  1.12.5: Writing an Equation Given Two Points
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>In this activity, you found the slope between two points and confirmed it with the slope formula. You then used one point and the slope to write the equation of a line in point-slope form. From here, you wrote the equation in slope-intercept form and used the graph to check your equation.  </li>

  </ul>
  
  <li>1.12.6: Choosing a Method to Write an Equation
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you discussed when to use each method of writing an equation. With a partner, you worked to find slopes and equations of lines using different methods.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
