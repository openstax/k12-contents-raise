<h4>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h4>
<p>Teacher note: students may need a review on inequalities.</p>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<p>Functions \(R\) and \(D\) give the height, in feet, of a toy rocket and a drone, \(t\) seconds after they are released. Here are the graphs of \(R\) (for the rocket) and \(D\) (for the drone).</p>

<ol>
<li>Which of the inequalities is true: \(R(2)&gt;D(2)\) or \(D(2)&gt; R(2)\)?</li>
<li>What was the height of the drone when the toy rocket hit the ground?</li>
<li>For what value of \(t\) is \(R(t)=D(t)\) true? What does this tell you about the drone and the toy rocket?</li>
</ol>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<ol>
<li>\(R(2)&gt;D(2)\)</li>
<li>20 feet</li>
<li>About \(t=4.5\). At 4.5 seconds, the toy rocket and the drone are at the same height.</li>
