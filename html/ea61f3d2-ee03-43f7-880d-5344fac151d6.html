<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Define arithmetic and geometric sequences recursively using function notation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Represent a sequence in different ways.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ask questions to get the information needed to represent a sequence in different ways.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    4.16.1: Define a Sequence
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In this activity, you reviewed identifying sequences as geometric, arithmetic, or neither.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    4.16.2: What Is a Recursive Definition?
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In this activity, you matched sequences with their recursive definitions.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    4.16.2: Self Check
  </li>
  <li>
    4.16.3: Ways to Represent a Sequence
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In this activity, you matched sequences with their recursive definitions and also represented the sequences on graphs.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    4.16.3: Self Check
  </li>
  <li>
    4.16.4: Geometric Recursive Definitions
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In this activity, you wrote a recursive definition given a geometric sequence. You then graphed the terms of the sequence.
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    4.16.5: Practice
  </li>
</ul>
