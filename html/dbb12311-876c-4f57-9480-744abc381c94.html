<p>When you write a quadratic in factored form, that helps you find the \(x\)-intercepts.<br> 
    \(y=x^2+2x-3\)<br>
    \(y=(x+3)(x-1)\)<br>
    </p>
    <p>When we set \(y=0\), we find the places where the parabola crosses the \(x\)-axis.</p>
    
    <p>\(0=(x+3)(x-1)\)</p>
    
    <p>So, \(0=x+3\) and \(0=x-1\)<br>
    \(x=-3\) and 1. </p>
    
    <p>-3 and 1 are called the real solutions to the quadratic equation.</p>
    
    <p>We can also start with the real solutions and use them to write quadratic equations.</p>
    
    <p>When we know that \(x=-3\) and 1, then that means \(0=x+3\) and \(0=x-1\).</p>
    
    <p>So, \(0=(x+3)(x-1)\).</p>
    
    <p>And, using the FOIL method to multiply this out, we come to <br>
    \(0=x^2+2x-3.\)</p>
    
    <p>When \(y\) is not equal to zero, we have the following quadratic equation</p>
    
    <p>\(y=x^2+2x-3\), which is exactly where we started!</p>
