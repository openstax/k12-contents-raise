<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity introduces students to finding a specific quadratic equation that has certain zeros and passes through
  a particular point. In previous lessons, students found a quadratic function that has certain zeros in its simplest
  standard form. In this activity, students will find a more specific quadratic function using the given point.</p>
<p>This is accomplished by using the intercept form, \(f(x) = a(x &minus; p)(x &minus; q)\), of a quadratic equation.
  The roots of the function and the given point are substituted into the function to find the value of \(a\). This value
  of the multiplier, \(a\), is then distributed through the equation to find the specific quadratic equation that meets
  our given criteria.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>In this activity, questions 1 &ndash; 3 provide a step-through introduction to finding the specific equation of a
  quadratic equation that has certain zeros and passes through a given point. Give students time to complete the first
  three questions and then pause for a class discussion.</p>
<p>While discussing the first three questions, emphasize that the function \(m(x) = x^2&minus; 3x &minus; 40\) is a
  function that has the zeros &ndash;5 and 8. As we found in question 3, \(m(x) = 2x^2&minus; 6x &minus; 80\) is another
  function that has the zeros &ndash;5 and 8. Only the function \(m(x) = 2x^2&minus; 6x &minus; 80\) passes through the
  point \((5, -60)\) and is the specific function we want. Show the graphs of these two functions using <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/0107b2bfda94c3432e1996a46a5cbfad3035b0cf" target="_blank">Desmos</a> to help visualize the difference between these two quadratic equations. Emphasize that
  these quadratic equations are related since they both have the same zeros and axis of symmetry (\(x = 1.5)\). Only one
  of them, however, passes through the point \((5, -60)\).</p>
<p>Allow students to complete questions 4 &ndash; 6 in pairs.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>When finding an exact function that has particular zeros and passes through a certain point, we use the intercept
  form of a quadratic function:</p>
<p>\(f(x) = a(x &minus; p)(x &minus; q)\)</p>
<p>The variables \(p\) and \(q\) represent the zeros or roots of the function. The variable \(a\) accounts for any
  constant that might have been factored out when solving.</p>
<p>Remember, if needed in the following problems, use the "^" symbol to enter exponents.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>To summarize key ideas from the activity, discuss the following questions:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> &ldquo;In this activity, what does it mean for two quadratic equations to be related?&rdquo; (Two quadratic
    functions are related if they have the same zeros and the same axis of symmetry.) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;How can you use the intercept form of a quadratic equation such as \(f(x) = a(x &minus; 5)(x &minus; 4)\)
    and a point that it passes through to find the value of \(a\)?&rdquo; (Substitute the point into the function and
    solve for the value of \(a\). Substitute the value of \(a\) back into the equation and multiply to find the standard
    form of the quadratic equation.) </li>

<h4>Finding a Quadratic Function from Its Zeros and a Point</h4>
<p>Think about how you would solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 &minus; 3x + 2 = 0\).</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> The factored form is \((x &minus; 1)(x &minus; 2) = 0\). </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> The solutions are \(x = 1\) and \(x = 2\). </li>
</ul>
<p>Now think about how you would solve \(2x^2 &minus; 6x + 4 = 0\).</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Factor out the GCF, 2. </li>
</ul>
<p>\(2(x^2 &minus; 3x + 2) = 0\)</p>
<p>It looks similar to the previous quadratic equation.</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> The factored form is \(2(x &minus; 1)(x &minus; 2) = 0\). </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Once again, the solutions are \(x = 1\) and \(x = 2\). </li>
</ul>
<p>Since they have the same solutions, these two quadratic equations are related. They have the same zeros and the same
  axis of symmetry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we are reversing this process, going from the zeros of a quadratic function to finding its standard form, it is
  possible there is a multiplier, such as 2 in the example above, that we do not know about.</p>
<p>To account for this, we use the variable \(a\) as the multiplier until we find out exactly what it is.</p>
<p>We can incorporate \(a\) into the function using the intercept form, \(f(x) = a(x &minus; p)(x &minus; q)\). The
  variables \(p\) and \(q\) represent the zeros or roots of the function.</p>
<p>Let's look at an example to help us understand.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Write the quadratic function, \(f(x)\), that has the zeros &ndash;5 and 4 and passes through the point \((-4, -16)\).
</p>
<p>We know the zeros are &ndash;5 and 4, so the factored form of the quadratic function is:</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(f(x) = (x + 5)(x &minus; 4)\).</p>
<p>The intercept form is \(f(x) = a(x + 5)(x &minus; 4)\).</p>
<p>We are given one more piece of information that allows us to find the value of \(a\). We know that the function
  passes through the point \((-4, -16)\).</p>
<p>We can substitute &ndash;4 for \(x\) and &ndash;16 for the value of the function and solve for \(a\).</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent"> \(f(x) = a(x + 5)(x &minus; 4)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(-16 = a((-4) + 5)((-4) &minus; 4)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(-16 = a(1)(-8)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(-16 = -8a\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(2 = a\)</p>
<p>Since we know \(a = 2\), we can substitute 2 for \(a\) into the intercept form of the quadratic function.</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(f(x) = a(x + 5)(x &minus; 4)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(f(x) = 2(x + 5)(x &minus; 4)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(f(x) = 2(x^2 + 5x &minus; 4x &minus; 20)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(f(x) = 2(x^2 + x &minus; 20)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(f(x) = 2x^2 + 2x &minus; 40\)</p>
<p>The specific function that has zeros &ndash;5 and 4 and passes through the point \((-4, -16)\) is:</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(f(x) = 2x^2 + 2x &minus; 40\).</p>
<p>Let's graph the functions to check our work.</p>
<p><img alt="TWO GRAPHED PARABOLAS, ONE RED AND ONE GREEN, BOTH OPENING UP AND BOTH HAVING \(x\)-intercepts OF NEGATIVE 5 AND 4. THE GREEN PARABOLA HAS A \(y\)-intercepts OF NEGATIVE 20. THE RED PARABOLA HAS A \(y\)-intercepts OF NEGATIVE 40 AND PASSES THROUGH THE POINT (NEGATIVE 4, NEGATIVE 16)." height="374" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/9db19e4cf408223871873e1c128afb7dc9fe58a9" width="374"></p>
<p>Notice that \(f(x) = x^2 + x &minus; 20\) and \(f(x) = 2x^2 + 2x &minus; 40\) have the same zeros. These quadratic
  functions are related.</p>
<p>Only \(f(x) = 2x^2 + 2x &minus; 40\) passes through \((-4, -16)\) and is the specific function we were looking for at
  the start.</p>
<div class="os-raise-graybox">
  <p>It is very important to note that this is why, in the previous lesson, we were looking for &ldquo;a function that
    has zeros at &ndash;5 and 4&rdquo; and not &ldquo;the function that has zeros at &ndash;5 and 4.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This difference in wording is very important since there are infinitely many functions that are related by their
    solutions.</p>
  <p>We can only determine an exact specific function if we have the additional information of a point through which the
    function passes.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>Let's try one more example.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 2</p>
<p>Write the quadratic function, \(g(x)\), in standard form, that has the zeros &ndash;7 and &ndash;3 and passes through
  the point \((-2, -5)\).</p>
<p>Since the zeros are &ndash;7 and &ndash;3, the factored form of the function is \(g(x) = (x + 7)(x + 3)\).</p>
<p>The intercept form of the function is \(g(x) = a(x + 7)(x + 3)\).</p>
<p>We substitute values using the point \((-2, -5)\) to find the value of \(a\).</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(g(x) = a(x + 7)(x + 3)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(-5 = a((-2) + 7)((-2) + 3)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(-5 = a(5)(1)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(-5 = 5a\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(-1 = a\)</p>
<p>Substitute the value of \(a\) into the intercept form of the function.</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(g(x) = a(x + 7)(x + 3)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(g(x) = -1(x + 7)(x + 3)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(g(x) = -1(x^2 + 7x + 3x + 21)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(g(x) = -1(x^2 + 10x + 21)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(g(x) = -x^2 &minus; 10x &minus; 21\)</p>
<p>The specific function that has zeros &ndash;7 and &ndash;3 and passes through the point \((-2, -5)\) is:</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(g(x) = -x^2 &minus; 10x &minus; 21\).</p>
<p>Let's graph the functions to check our work.</p>
<p><img alt="GRAPH OF TWO PARABOLAS, ONE RED AND ONE GREEN, BOTH WITH \(x\)-intercepts OF NEGATIVE 7 AND NEGATIVE 3. THE GREEN PARABOLA OPENS UP.

<p>Again, notice that \(g(x) = x^2 + 10x + 21\) and \(g(x) = &minus;x^2 &minus; 10x &minus; 21\) have the same zeros.
  They are related quadratic functions.</p>
<p>Even though the leading coefficient is negative and the function has been reflected over the \(x\)-axis, only \(g(x)
  = &minus;x^2 &minus; 10x &minus; 21\) passes through \((-2, -5)\).</p>
<h4>Try It: Finding a Quadratic Function from Its Zeros and a Point</h4>
<p>Write the quadratic function, \(h(x)\), that has the zeros 2 and 6 and passes through the point \((7, 15)\).</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the<strong> solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to find a function when given its zeros and a point:</p>
<p>The zeros are 2 and 6.</p>
<p>The intercept form is \(h(x) = a(x &minus; 2)(x &minus; 6)\).</p>
<p>Use the point \((7, 15)\) to find \(a\).</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(h(x) = a(x &minus; 2)(x &minus; 6)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(15 = a((7) &minus; 2)((7) &minus; 6)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(15 = a(5)(1)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(3 = a\)</p>
<p>Substitute 3 for the value of \(a\) in the intercept form.</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(h(x) = a(x &minus; 2)(x &minus; 6)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(h(x) = 3(x^2 &minus; 2x &minus; 6x + 12)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(h(x) = 3(x^2 &minus; 8x + 12)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(h(x) = 3x^2 &minus; 24x + 36\)</p>
<p>The specific quadratic with zeros of 2 and 6 that passes through the point \((7, 15)\) is \(h(x) = 3x^2 &minus; 24x +
  36\).</p>
