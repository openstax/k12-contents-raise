<p>Andre uses the expression \((x&minus;5)^2+7\) to define \(f\).</p>
<p>Noah uses the expression \((x+5)^2&minus;7\) to define \(f\).</p>
<p>Do you agree with either of them?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>No. The vertex of the graph is \((5,-7)\). The graph of Andre&rsquo;s function would have a vertex at \((5,7)\), and the graph of Noah&rsquo;s function would have a vertex at \((-5,-7)\).</p>
