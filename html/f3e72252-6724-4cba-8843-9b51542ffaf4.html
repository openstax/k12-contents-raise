<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>In the preceding activity, students looked at the regions that represent solutions and non-solutions to inequalities. They recognized that the boundary between the two regions is the graph of an equation that is related to the inequality. Students did not, however, look closely at whether the boundary line itself is a part of the solution. That investigation is the focus of this activity.</p>
<p>Students reason with algebraic and graphical representations of inequalities in two directions. They first graph the solutions to given inequalities, and later write inequalities whose solutions could be represented by given graphs.</p>
<p>If many students get stuck on graphing or writing inequalities, consider moving fairly quickly through the activity and using the discussion questions in the Lesson Synthesis to help students gain clarity and focus.</p>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<p>Display the inequalities \( x \ge y \) and \( x &gt; y \) for all to see. Then, ask students to consider whether the following coordinate pairs are solutions to each inequality.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>\( (5,4) \)</li>
  <li>\( (5,4.9) \)</li>
  <li>\( (5,5) \)</li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure students understand why all three coordinate pairs are solutions to \( x \ge y \), but only \( (5,4) \) and \( (5,4.9) \) are solutions to \( x &gt; y \). Display two graphs, each representing one of these inequalities.</p>
<img alt="Pair of inequality graphs." height="197" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/d58d2074b2f6768d7c2a4518e293bab0610710ec" width="428">
<br><br>
<p>Ask students to predict which graph represents which inequality. Consider polling the class on their predictions.</p>
<p>Explain that the solid line is a way to say that all the points on that line (\( x=y \)) are solutions, and the dashed line is a way to say otherwise. (This is similar to how we use solid and open circles to represent the boundary values of a one-variable inequality on a number line.)</p>
<p>Because the solutions to \( x&gt;y \) do not include coordinates where \( x \) and \( y \) are equal, the graph of \( x=y \) is drawn with a dashed line. The solutions to \( x\geq y \) do include coordinates where \( x \) and \( y \) are equal, so the graph of \( x=y \) is drawn with a solid line.</p>
<p>Tell students they will now sketch the solutions of some other inequalities and think about whether or not the boundary line is included in the solutions.</p>

  <h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
  <p>Some students may struggle with the second set of questions because they do not recall how to write an equation for a vertical line or a horizontal line. Suggest that they write the coordinates of several points on the line and look for a pattern. For example, some points on the vertical line are \( (3,\text-2), (3, 0), (3,4) \), and \( (3,6) \). Noticing that the \( x \)-value is always 3, regardless of the \( y \)-value, may help remind students that the equation is \( x=3 \).</p>
  <h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
  <p>Select students to share their sketched graphs for the first set of questions and the inequalities they wrote for the second set of questions. Use their work and explanations to help the class synthesize the new ideas in this lesson.</p>

  <h4>Recognize the Relation Between the Solutions of an Inequality and its Graph</h4>
  <p>Now, we will look at how the solutions of an inequality relate to its graph. Let&rsquo;s think about the number line shown previously again. The point x = 3 separated that number line into two parts. On one side of 3 are all the numbers less than 3. On the other side of 3 all the numbers are greater than 3. See the figure below.
</p>
  <img alt class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="72" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/5d0288de5ccd152c0943577dea1e3e7902515d40" width="450"><br>
<br>
      <br>
  <p>The solution of \( x&gt;3 \) is the shaded part of the number line to the right of \( x = 3 \)</p>
  <p>Similarly, the line \(y = x + 4\) separates the plane into two regions. On one side of the line are points with \( y &lt; x + 4\) . On the other side of the line are the points with \( y &gt; x + 4 \). We call the line \( y &gt; x + 4 \) a <strong>boundary line. </strong></p>

<div class="os-raise-graybox">
      <p><strong>Boundary Line</strong><br>
          The line with equation \( Ax + By = C \) is the boundary line that separates the region where \( Ax + By &gt; C \) from the region where \( Ax + By &lt; C \). </p>

      <br>
  <p>Now, let&rsquo;s take a look at what we found in the example above. We&rsquo;ll start by graphing the line \( y = x + 4 \), and then we&rsquo;ll plot the five points we tested, as shown in the graph. See the figure below.
</p>
  <img alt class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="606" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/e779e442c4198dc4bd5d2014d08e1bff3b30c48d" width="400"><br>
<br>
  <p>In the previous example, we found that some of the points were solutions to the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \) and some were not.
</p>
  <p>Which of the points we plotted are solutions to the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \)? </p>
  <p>The points \( (1, 6) \) and \( (-8, 12) \) are solutions to the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \). Notice that they are both on the same side of the boundary line \( y &gt; x + 4 \). </p>
  <p>The two points \( (0, 0) \) and \( (-5, -15) \) are on the other side of the boundary line \( y = x + 4 \), and they are not solutions to the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \). For those two points. \( y &lt; x + 4 \). </p>
  <p>What about the point \( (2, 6) \)? Because \( 6 = 2 + 4 \), the point is a solution to the equation \( y = x + 4 \), but not a solution to the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \) so the point \( (2, 6) \) is on the boundary line. </p>
  <p>Let's take another point above the boundary line and test whether or not it is a solution to the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \). The point \( (0, 10) \) clearly looks to above the boundary line, doesn't it? Is it a solution to the inequality? </p>
  <p>\( y &gt; x + 4 \)<br>
  \( 10 &gt; 0 + 4 \)<br>
  \( 10 &gt; 4 \)</p>
  <p>So, \( (0, 10) \) is a solution to \( y &gt; x + 4 \). </p>
  <p>Any point you choose above the boundary line is a solution to the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \). All points above the boundary line are solutions. </p>
  <p>Similarly, all points below the boundary line, the side with \( (0, 0) \) and \( (&minus;5, &minus;15) \), are not solutions to \( y &gt; x + 4 \), as shown in the figure below.
</p>
  <img alt class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="606" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/2b394e6ec6217d6bafaf36078cbf643155b0c85b" width="400"><br>
<br>
<br>
  <p>The graph of the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \) is shown in below. </p>
  <p>The line \( y = x + 4 \) divides the plane into two regions. The shaded side shows the solutions to the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \). </p>
  <p>The points on the boundary line, those where\( y = x + 4 \), are not solutions to the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \), so the line itself is not part of the solution. We show that by making the line dashed, not solid. </p>
