<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>The opening lesson helps students review finding the slope using the slope formula. This helps students practice substituting values for variables in formulas, which will be needed when finding equations of lines given different information. Finding the slope of a line is the first step in finding the equation of a line given two points.</p>
<p>Students will write equations of lines given certain information. Students are familiar with identifying the slope and \(y\)-intercept from the equation of a line. In this lesson, they will write the equation of a line given the slope and \(y\)-intercept. It can be helpful to use graphs of the lines so students can see how the values of the slope and \(y\)-intercept affect the graph.</p>
<p>Students will learn to use the point-slope form to write the equation of a line when given the slope and a point and when given two points. Students will use skills of manipulating equations as they substitute and solve. Encourage students to write out their steps and find ways to verify their answers, such as sharing with a partner or using a graphing utility or Desmos. </p>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
    <p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audio tape, video, DVD, and CD ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment </li>
      <li>ELPS 2(I) demonstrate listening comprehension of increasingly complex spoken English by following directions, retelling or summarizing spoken messages, responding to questions and requests, collaborating with peers, and taking notes commensurate with content and grade-level needs </li>
      <li>ELPS 3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions </li>
      <li>ELPS 3(I) adapt spoken language appropriately for formal and informal purposes </li>
