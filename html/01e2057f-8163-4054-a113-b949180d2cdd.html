<h4>Lesson Narrative&nbsp;</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The opening lesson helps students review finding the slope using the slope formula. This helps students practice substituting values for variables in formulas, which will be needed when finding equations of lines given different information. Finding the slope of a line is the first step in finding the equation of a line given two points.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students will write equations of lines given certain information. Students are familiar with identifying the slope and \(y\)-intercept from the equation of a line. In this lesson, they will write the equation of a line given the slope and \(y\)-intercept. It can be helpful to use graphs of the lines so students can see how the values of the slope and \(y\)-intercept affect the graph.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students will learn to use the point-slope form to write the equation of a line when given the slope and a point and when given two points. Students will use skills of manipulating equations as they substitute and solve. Encourage students to write out their steps and find ways to verify their answers, such as sharing with a partner or using a graphing utility or Desmos.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
