<p>John Hope Bryant founded Operation Hope to coach underserved young people and adults through life&rsquo;s challenges, facilitating their journey to financial independence. Exponential functions can be used to help express and calculate growth, and these concepts can be used to save money and help obtain financial security.</p>
<p>In this section, you will analyze and interpret exponential situations as functions. You will use exponential functions to model situations that involve exponential growth and decay.&nbsp;<span>You will deepen your understanding of exponential functions by identifying key features of their graphs and by analyzing two or more graphs simultaneously.</span></p>
