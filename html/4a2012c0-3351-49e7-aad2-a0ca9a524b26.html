<h3> Compare and Contrast Graphs</h3>
<p>Compare and contrast the graphs of \(y=2x\) and \(y=2^x\).</p>
<p>To compare and contrast the graphs of these functions, you would first need to graph them.</p>

<p>Both equations have a 2 and an \(x\) in them, but in \(y = 2x\), \(x\) is multiplied by 2, and in \(y = 2^x\), 2 is
  the base and \(x\) is the exponent. If you graph the equations together on the same grid, it makes it easier to
  discuss the key features and compare the graphs.</p>

  <p>Here is how to compare and contrast the graphs of \(y=3x+1\) and \(y=3^x\):</p>
  <p>First, you need to graph both equations on the same plane.</p>

  <p>Then you can compare key features of the graph, like points where they are equal and intercepts. Answers may vary,
    but here is a sample answer. Your answer may include all or part of the sample.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> The functions are equal at their \(y\)-intercept \((0,1)\) and also at \((1.6, 5.8)\).</li>
    <li>\( y=3x+1\) is linear and is greater when \(0&lt;x&lt;1.6\).</li>
    <li>\(
      y=3^x\) is exponential and greater when \(x&lt;0\) and \(x&gt;1.6\). </li>
  </ul>
