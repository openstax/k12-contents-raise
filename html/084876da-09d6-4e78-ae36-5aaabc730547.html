<h3>Activity (10 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity seeks to activate students' intuition about the relationship between input and output by allowing them to investigate this relationship with images and numbers. The activity also provides students with key experiences that will anchor more abstract concepts such as domain, range, function notation, etc.</p>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<ol>
<li>Instruct students to play with the Function Builder for 5 minutes. </li>
<li>
  Encourage them to share what they are trying or investigating with their group members. If needed, provide students with the question prompts: <em>“What did you try? What happened? How did you create that?”</em> And the sentence stem, <em>“I tried … and it caused … to happen.”</em> Note that students may investigate any of the screens: Patterns, Numbers, or Equations. </li>
<li>
  Circulate, addressing logistical concerns with accessing the simulation and observing student interactions and discoveries. 
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Student Activity </h3>
<div class="os-raise-familysupport">
<p><a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/function-builder/latest/function-builder_en.html" target="_blank">Access the interactive simulator</a> to begin this project.</p>
</div>
<p>Today you are going to investigate something called an interactive simulation. It is a tool that will help you visualize how functions work.
  <br/>

<br/>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/function-builder/latest/function-builder_en.html" target="_blank">Open the interactive simulator, Function Builder</a> in your web browser. You will use it to complete this project. It will look like the image above.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Play with any of the screens on the Function Builder for 5 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - As you discover how the tool works, share your thinking with your group members. You may want to use the following question and sentence stem to guide your discussions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did you try? What happened?</li>
<li>I tried … and it caused … to happen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Write down two things you notice or have questions about, and one thing a neighbor noticed that is interesting to you.</p>
<h3>Student Responses</h3>
<p>Things students might notice:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>When I put something into the tube, it comes out the other end.</li>
<li>Nothing happened until I pulled one of the bottom arrows into the tube. </li>
<li>The camera made the pictures become black and white.</li>
<li>The rainbow changes the color of the pictures.</li>
<li>Sometimes I can drag a card backwards, sometimes I can't.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>After 5 minutes, bring the class together for a brief discussion about what they noticed.
Project the sim so that you can have a student come to the front to demonstrate their thinking. 
</p>
<p><strong>Use the following questions to lead a class discussion.</strong></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<p><li>What is something you noticed you can do in this simulation? </li></p>
<p><li>What happens when you drag a card through the builder? </li></p>
<p><li>What does the erase button do?</li></p>
<p><li>What does this checkbox do? </li></p>
<img height="50" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/d1977f9b78787c2c974a00885789b1c2f1a390b5"/>
<p><li>What questions do you have? (Write down student questions that you want to have answered by the end of the activity.)</li></p>
<p><li>Which cards seemed interesting to you? (May like functions like the Warhol soup can, mystery C, or inputs like the planet. Be sure someone mentions the “x” input on the Equations screen- if they don't, show them.) </li></p></ol>
<h3>Discussion Follow-up</h3>
<p>Students will start to make meaning of a function through noticing patterns, and noticing that every screen in this simulation has cards on the left, right, and cards on the bottom. It is most important at this stage of the project that students understand how to use the simulation and trust that they have ownership over how they interact with it. 


<ul>
<li>Ensure students notice that they have a choice to compose one function or up to three.</li>
<li>Also, if students have not observed that outputs update when new functions have been added to the “machine,” bring it to their attention. </li>
<li>If students use multiple functions, press them to consider if the order of the functions makes a difference as to the output. </li>
</ul>
