<h2>Inquiry Project Unit 6 Overview</h2>

<h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>

<p>In this project, students will be introduced to an area model as a tool for finding products. They will start with a numerical area model, focusing on two-digit numbers and discovering that you can partition a rectangle into smaller areas whose sum is the total area of the rectangle. They will then apply this area model to algebraic expressions, noticing that an area model can be used to multiply polynomials.</p>

<p>Students will first be asked to play with a simulation for a few minutes. This open play time allows students to learn how to use a simulation for learning, discover how they can interact with it, and feel ownership of their learning from the simulation. Following open play, students can share how to use the simulation, so every student is aware of the controls and how to interact.</p>
    
<p>When students are engaging with the activity sheet, they should be pausing to discuss some of their responses with a partner. The whole class discussions should produce a rich variety of thoughts and observations based on individual responses and partner discussions. </p>
    
<p>By the end of the lesson, students should have completed the activity sheets using the simulation, and should be able to use an area model to multiply two two-digit numbers or two polynomials, and explain why an area model can be used to find the product of two factors. </p>

<h3>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h3>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<p><li> Describe the product of two factors as the area of a rectangle and a sum of partial products</li></p>

<h2>Activity IP6.1: DISCOVERING AN AREA MODEL</h2>
<h3>Warm Up (5 - 10 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm up activity seeks to activate students’ prior understanding about the multiplication of multi-digit numbers and the area of a rectangle defined by dimensions with those numbers.  <br>

The activity also provides students with key experiences they will use in later activities to explore partial products and more abstract ideas such as multiplying monomials and binomials of degree one.</p>

<h3>Launch</h3>

<p>Instruct students to play with the Area Model Algebra simulation for 5 minutes. </p>

<p>
Encourage them to share what they are trying or investigating with their group members. If needed, provide students with the question prompts: <em>“What did you try? What happened? How did you create that?”</em> And the sentence stem, <em>“I tried … and it caused … to happen.”</em> Note that students may investigate any of the screens. </p>
<p>
Circulate, addressing logistical concerns with accessing the simulation and observing student interactions and discoveries. 
</p>
<p>
Share the following information with students:
<br>
Today you are going to investigate something called an interactive simulation. 
</p>
<p><li>To access the simulation, go <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/area-model-algebra/latest/area-model-algebra_en.html?screens=1,2,3">here</a> and start playing with the simulation. </li></p>


<p><li>Once the activity is loaded, play with the simulation.</li></p>
<p>
    As you discover how the tool works, share your thinking with your group members. You may want to use the following question and sentence stem to guide your discussions:
   <p><li> <em>What did you try? What happened?</em> </li></p>
    <p><li><em>I tried … and it caused … to happen.</em></li></p> 
</p>
<p><li>Write down three things you notice or have questions about on your activity sheet.</li></p>
<p><li>Be prepared to share your findings with the whole class. </li></p>

<h3>Student-Facing Statement </h3>

<h3>Student Response</h3>
<p>Answers will vary. Sample student responses may include:<br>

1. What does the <em>area of a rectangle</em> have to do with <em>multiplication</em>? &#128172;
</p>

<strong>ANSWER(S): </strong>
<p><li>The area of a rectangle measures the amount of space covered by a rectangle. We can find the area by multiplying the dimensions.</li></p>
<p><li>The side lenths of a rectangle must be multiplied together to determine the area of the shape. </li></p>
<p><li>Dividing the sides into single units creates unit tiles that can be counted to find the area of the rectangle. If we side lengths were multiplied together, we would get the same answer as when we added the unit tiles. </li></p>

<p>2. Play with Area Model Algebra for 5 minutes. Write down two things you notice or have questions about, and one thing a neighbor noticed that is interesting to you. </p> 

<p><strong>ANSWER(S): </strong></p>
<p><li>The gray/shaded rectangle gets larger if I pull on the green circle.</li></p>
<p><li>As the shaded rectangle changes shape, the top number and the side numbers change, too. </li></p>
<p><li>I can use the triangle lines to divide up the shaded rectangle. </li></p>
<p><li>When I use the triangle lines, it divides up the side lengths, too. </li></p>
<p><li>The side boxes will tell me the dimensions of the rectangle and the total area, too. </li></p> 
<p><li>When I click on the boxes under partial products, it show me how much area is covered in each piece. It will even show me how the calculations are determined.</li></p>
<p><li>I can make the big white rectangle be 20x20 or 100x100 squares. </li></p>
<p><li>When I chose the 100x100 squares, the side lengths are measured in sets of 10. </li></p>

<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>After 5 minutes, bring the class together for a brief discussion about what they noticed.<br>

Project the sim so that you can have a student come to the front to demonstrate their thinking. Solicit student responses to the following questions:
</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<p><li>What is something you noticed you can do in this simulation? On the Explore screen, what do the red and blue triangles do? </li></p>

<p><li>Did anyone discover what this checkbox does? <em>Note: It may only be visible when students have selected to work with the 20x20 rectangle.</em> </li>

<p><li>What questions do you have? (Write down student questions that you want them to answer by the end of the activity.)</li>

<img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/98f8034b3c572d4c6d73853a245144f6ab3b43fa" height="200" ></p>

</ol>
<p>
Students will start to make meaning of an area model through noticing the total area, the partial products, and making sense of how the partial products are calculated. It is most important at this stage that students understand how to use the simulation and trust that they have ownership over how they interact with it. </p>


<h2>Activity IP6.2: UNDERSTANDING AN AREA MODEL</h2>

<h3>Project Activity (15 minutes)</h3>

<p>This activity will get students playing with a numerical area model while directing their attention toward the values on the outside and the values on the inside. It is important that students explain how the partial products are calculated, write the partial products as a sum, and discover that the sum of the partial products is equal to the total area of the rectangle. 
<h3>Launch</h3>
<p><li>Allow students to work independently to answer questions on their activity sheet, stopping where indicated to have small-group or whole-class discussions.</li></p>
<p><li>Circulate as students work on Part 2 of the activity sheet, noting interesting responses. After you notice that groups have discussed #3, pause and bring the class together for a whole-class discussion. </li></p>
<p><li>Call on groups to share out what changes and what doesn't change when the partition slides are moved. </li></p>
<p><li>After you notice that individuals have finished questions through the summary, pause and bring the class together for a whole-class discussion. Allow multiple students to share their responses for #4, and as a class notice that the partial products are different depending on where the partitions go, but the total area is always 150. </li></p></p>

<p>
    What is the total area of this rectangle? Represent the total area in multiple ways.<br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> 108. Using the area model, 6•18 = 6•10 + 6•8, which is 60+48. 
</p>

<p>
    <li>In an area model, how do the partial products (interior numbers) get calculated?</li>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> They are calculated by multiplying the side lengths after partitioning the sides of the big rectangle. Like in 6•18, the partial products were 6•10 and 6•8. 
</p>

<p>
    <li>In an area model, what are two different ways the total area could get calculated?</li>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> One way is by partitioning the sides to get smaller rectangles, finding the areas of those, and adding them up. Another way is by adding up all of the square units of the large rectangle. 
</p>

<p>
    <li>How do the partial products relate to the total area of the area model? </li>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> The partial products add up to the total area of the area model. 
</p>
</ol>
<p>
Circulate around the room to hear similarities between groups. Write student ideas on the board to give value to contributions.  </p>

<p>Sample discussion questions: </p>
<p><li>Did anyone show the yellow boxes? What did they do? </li></p>
<p><li>If you were to add up the areas inside the rectangle, where is a useful place to break up the rectangle so you have “easier” numbers to add up? </li></p>

<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>Using an area model with numbers before variables allows students to connect their understanding of the area of a rectangle to algebraic thinking, namely the distributive property. When we multiply two numbers, we are essentially finding the area of a rectangle with a length and a width that are equivalent to those two factors. Since we will be talking about multiplying algebraic expressions, we could apply the same thinking as we do with the area of a rectangle. Before we can do that, students need to have a solid understanding of the area of a rectangle as the product of two factors. Starting with whole numbers is a jumping off point for students to see the distributive property in action with partial products that make sense.</p> 

<p>If students are struggling at the start of this lesson, you could consider asking them to multiply 15✕18 by hand, and see what that process is like. Save their work and compare it with their area model. Which one makes more sense to them? </p>

</ol>

<h2>Activity IP6.3: USING AN AREA MODEL</h2>
<h3>Project Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>In the activity, students will use an area model to find the product of two two-digit numbers. We want students to notice the total area of their models is consistent, and notice that partitioning by place value is "easier" to add up the parts than partitioning somewhere random. Another goal here is to have students see that they can group like-terms (in this case, all of the integers), to support them later with algebra tiles. Finally, students can test their knowledge of factors, partial products, and total area by playing an area model game. </p>

<h3>Launch</h3>
<p><li>Allow students to work independently to answer questions on their activity sheet, stopping where indicated to have small-group or whole-class discussions.</li></p>
<p><li>Circulate as students work on Part 3 of the activity sheet, noting interesting responses. After you notice that groups have discussed #1c, pause and bring the class together for a whole-class discussion. </li></p>
<p><li>Call on groups to share out what is the same and what is different in their various area models.</li></p> 
<p><li>Ask if any partitions were noticeably "easier" to add than others.</li></p>
<p><li>Encourage students to test their area models using the Generic screen in the simulation.</li></p>
<p><li>A common error might be partitioning 17 into 1 and 7 instead of 10 and 7. If you notice students making this error, ask them what the total side length of their rectangle is to push them to see their error. </li></p>

<strong>Answer:</strong> I know my area model represents 17x13 because I broke it into 10, 10, 3, and 7. 10 and 3 were across the top dimension with 10 and 7 along the side dimension. Then, I found the area - or number of unit tiles - in each section. For instance, 10x10 was 100 square units. 3x10 was 30, 7x10 was 70. So far, that gives me 200. But I still needed to multiply the 3 and 7 which gave me 21. So, in total, the area is 221. And if I multiply it out by hand on my paper, I get 221, too.

<li>  What are three different ways you could partition 17? </li>

<br>
  <strong>Answer:</strong>
  <li>\(15 + 2\)</li>
  <li>\(10 + 7\)</li>
  <li>\(8 + 9\)</li>
  <li>Etc.</li>

  <li>
    Write your own 2-digit times 2-digit multiplication problem that uses an area model, and find the total area. 
    <em>Ask students to share their problems with their classmates.</em>
  </li> 
</p>

<p>
  <li>What is a convenient way to break up a multiplication problem into an area model, and why is it convenient for you?</li>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> If a problem is broken up into its place values, then it is “y” to multiply by sets of 10 and then add those pieces together.

<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>After you notice that individuals have finished questions through the summary, pause and bring the class together for a whole-class discussion. Allow multiple students to share their responses for #4 and especially #5. Help the class notice that partitioning by place value means we'll get some “easier” partial products to add, since one dimension will end up being 10. This will also prepare students for area models that use binomial dimensions where constant terms are often placed “at the end.” If other students have other ideas about efficiency with an area model, allow them to share. </p>


<h2>Activity IP6.4: APPLYING AN AREA MODEL</h2>

<h3>Project Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>In the activity, students will be introduced to an area model with variables. This may be a challenging step, but remind students that the side lengths in an area model have been sums up to now (ex: \(10+7\)) and an expression is just another sum. Once students have finished this activity, they should be able to make comparisons between area models with numbers and area models with variables. </p>


<h3>Launch</h3>
<p>
<li>Allow students to work independently to answer questions on their activity sheet, stopping where indicated to have small-group or whole-class discussions.</li></p>
<p><li>Circulate as students work on Part 4 of the activity sheet, noting interesting responses.</li></p>
<p><li>Notice that #1 is a repeat of the summary from part 2. Push students to reflect on their original answers. Are they similar, or has something changed about their responses? </li></p>
<p><li>For #2, if students are struggling with how to interpret this area model, encourage them to think about x as having a value. x=10 would be a simple case. This is just like when we multiplied 6✕18. </li></p>
<p><li>For #3, if students are struggling, it may help to remind them of like terms and which can be combined. </li></p>
<p><li>Students will soon work with algebra tiles to solidify these concepts, and you can always come back to the simulation to show how algebra tiles are similar to filling in an area model.</li></p>
<p><li>After you notice that individuals have finished questions through the summary, pause and bring the class ßtogether for a whole-class discussion. Allow multiple students to share their responses for #2-3 and explain their thinking. Then call on multiple students to share their ideas for the summary. </li></p>
<p><li>If time, allow students to try the extension and share their thinking with the class. Working backwards to factor is coming later in the unit! </li></p>

  5. Challenge yourself to work through levels 1-4 of the <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/area-model-algebra/latest/area-model-algebra_en.html?screens=4" >Area Model Algebra Game</a>! <br>
  <em>In this challenge, students are given different rectangular scenarios that involve variables and asked to determine partial products, dimensions, etc. Students may choose their level of difficulty/challenge.</em>
</p>


<p>6. How is multiplying variable expressions using an area model similar to multiplying numbers using an area model? <br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> In both, the total area is the product of the two factors or sides. In both, the product is found by adding the partial/interior products. In both, we can partition the factor or side in a way that is convenient for multiplication. Both use the distributive property.</p>
