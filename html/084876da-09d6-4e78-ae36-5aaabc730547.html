<h2>Inquiry Project Unit 4 Overview</h2>

<h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>

<p>In this project, students will apply their prior knowledge about plotting coordinate points, evaluating expressions using the correct order of operations, and simplifying algebraic expressions, to generate initial ideas about functions.</p> 

  <p>Students will first be asked to play with a simulation for a few minutes. This open play time allows students to learn how to use a simulation for learning, discover how they can interact with it, and feel ownership of their learning from the simulation. Following open play, students can share how to use the simulation, so every student is aware of the controls and how to interact.</p> 
  
  <p>When students are engaging with the activity sheet, they should be pausing to discuss some of their responses with a partner. The whole class discussions should produce a rich variety of thoughts and observations based on individual responses and partner discussions. </p>
  
<p>  By the end of the lesson, students should have completed the activity sheets using the simulation, and should be able to describe a function as having inputs, outputs, and behaving consistently. They should also be able to evaluate a function using different inputs, and be able to summarize the impact that certain operations have on the algebraic function, the table of values, the appearance of the graph, and the outputs. </p>


<h3>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h3>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<p><li> Define a function as a rule relating each input to exactly one output and consistently acting on inputs. </li></p>
<p><li>Predict outputs of a function using given inputs.</li></p>
<p><li>Describe a linear function in terms of a table, graph, equation, or series of operations.</li></p>

<h3>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h3>
<p><li>I can define a function.</li></p>
<p><li>I can predict the output of a function using a given input.</li></p> 
<p><li> I can describe a linear function in terms of a table, graph, equation, or series of operations. </li></p> 


<h3>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h3>
<p><li>ALG1.1(B) Use a problem-solving model that incorporates analyzing given information, formulating a play or strategy, determining a solution, justifying the solution, and evaluating the problem-solving process and the reasonableness of the solution.</li></p>
<p><li>ALG1.1(E) Create and use representations to organize, record, and communicate mathematical ideas. </li></p> 
<p><li>ALG1.12(B) Decide whether relations represented verbally, tabularly, graphically, and symbolically define a function.</li></p> 
<p><li>ALG1.12(C) Evaluate functions, expressed in function notation, given one or more elements in their domains.</li></p> 



<h3>Required Materials</h3>

<h3>Project Activities</h3> 
<p><li>Activity IP4.1: Simulating Relationships</li></p>
<p><li>Activity IP4.2: What is a Function?</li></p>
<p><li>Activity IP4.3: Different Kinds of Functions</li></p>


<h2>Activity IP4.1: Simulating Relationships </h2>
<h3>Warm Up (5 - 10 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm up activity seeks to activate students’ intuition about the relationship between input and output by allowing them to investigate this relationship with images and numbers. <br>

  The activity also provides students with key experiences that will anchor more abstract concepts such as domain, range, function notation, etc.</p>

<h3>Launch</h3>

<p>Instruct students to play with the  Function Builder for 5 minutes. </p>

<p>
Encourage them to share what they are trying or investigating with their group members. If needed, provide students with the question prompts: <em>“What did you try? What happened? How did you create that?”</em> And the sentence stem, <em>“I tried … and it caused … to happen.”</em> Note that students may investigate any of the screens: Patterns, Numbers, or Equations. </p>
<p>
Circulate, addressing logistical concerns with accessing the simulation and observing student interactions and discoveries. 
</p>

<h3>Student-Facing Statement </h3>

<p>Today you are going to investigate something called an interactive simulation.</p>

<ul>
  <p><li>To access the simulation, go <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/function-builder/latest/function-builder_en.html"> here</a> and start playing with the simulation. </li></p>

  <img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/7b20529fd41c1a24ad0c6e3ce0ff5947b66ad0c6" height="300">
  
  <p><li>Once the activity is loaded, play with the simulation.</li></p>
  
  <p><li>As you discover how the tool works, share your thinking with your group members. You may want to use the following question and sentence stem to guide your discussions:<br>
<ul>
    <li><em>What did you try? What happened?</em></li> 
    <li><em>I tried … and it caused … to happen. </em></li>
</ul>
  </li></p>
  
  <p><li>Write down three things you notice or have questions about on your activity sheet.</p></li>
  <p><li>Be prepared to share your findings with the whole class.</li></p> 
  
  
</ul>


<h3>Student Response</h3>
<p>Answers will vary. Sample student responses may include:<br></p>

<p><li>When I put something into the tube, it comes out the other end.</li></p>
<p><li>Nothing happened until I pulled one of the bottom arrows into the tube. </li></p>
<p><li>The camera made the pictures become black and white.</li></p>
<p><li>The rainbow changes the color of the pictures.</li></p>
<p><li>Sometimes I can drag a card backwards, sometimes I can't.</li></p>

  
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>After 5 minutes, bring the class together for a brief discussion about what they noticed.<br>

Project the sim so that you can have a student come to the front to demonstrate their thinking. Solicit student responses to the following questions:
</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<p><li>What is something you noticed you can do in this simulation? </li></p>
<p><li>What happens when you drag a card through the builder? </li></p>
<p><li>What does the erase button do?</li></p>
<p><li>What does this checkbox do? </li></p>

<img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/d1977f9b78787c2c974a00885789b1c2f1a390b5" height="50">

<p><li>What questions do you have? (Write down student questions that you want to have answered by the end of the activity.)</li></p>

<p><li>Which cards seemed interesting to you? (May like functions like the Warhol soup can, mystery C, or inputs like the planet. Be sure someone mentions the “x” input on the Equations screen- if they don't, show them.) </li></p></ol>

<p>Students will start to make meaning of a function through noticing patterns, and noticing that every screen in this simulation has cards on the left, right, and cards on the bottom. It is most important at this stage of the project that students understand how to use the simulation and trust that they have ownership over how they interact with it. 
</p>

<p><li>Ensure students notice that they have a choice to compose one function or up to three.</li></p>
<p><li>Also, if students have not observed that outputs update when new functions have been added to the “machine,” bring it to their attention. </li></p>
<p><li>If students use multiple functions, press them to consider if the order of the functions makes a difference as to the output. </li></p>
  


<h2>Activity IP4.2: What is a function?</h2>

<h3>Project Activity (15 minutes)</h3>

<p>This activity will get students interacting directly with a function so they can discover the basic principles of a function. It is important that students can name the parts of a function, come up with an initial definition of a function, be able to describe a function, and see that a function always behaves consistently. </p>

<h3>Launch</h3>

<p><li>Allow students to work independently to answer questions on their activity sheet, stopping where indicated to have small-group or whole-class discussions.</li></p>
<p><li>Circulate as students work on Part 2 of the activity sheet, noting interesting responses. After you notice that groups have discussed #2, pause and bring the class together for a whole-class discussion. </li></p>
<p><li>Call on groups to share out some of their names. Write them on the board. If there are a lot of responses, circle a few that you will agree mean input, output, and function or operation.Allow students the freedom to use the names they prefer.</li></p>

<p><li>After you notice that individuals have finished #3, pause and bring the class together for a whole-class discussion.</li> </p>
<p><li>Call on students to share out their definitions in #3. Lead class in combining the various answers to write a definition as a class. </li></p>
<p><li>When you notice groups discussing #4, give a 2 minutes time warning.</li></p>

 <p>
<li>
      Circulate around the room to hear similarities between groups. Write student ideas on the

</li></ol>


</ol>


<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>The use of multiple inputs allows students to see that the function behaves consistently, and the simulation mimics building an input/output table. The use of the “see-inside” boxes equate to the use of process columns when building tables. 
  <br><br>
  Of note is the ability for students to investigate if functions are invertible. This provides an opportunity to discuss why some outputs can be pulled back through some functions but not others. If students discover this, allow them to share with the class, even though it is beyond the scope of today’s lesson. <br>
  
  <br>Allowing students to investigate the concept of a function with visual images provides them with mathematical experience that sets them up to investigate functions using numbers.</p>

</ol>

<h2>Activity IP4.3: Different Kinds of Functions</h2>
<h3>Project Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>In the Numbers Screen activity, students will explore an arithmetic function using the terms “input” and “output.” As students build a function, the equation representation updates dynamically and includes a simplified representation. Students can observe the resulting outputs as in the previous activity, and as an explicit table of ordered pairs. <br><br>

  In the Equations Screen activity, students build on their experiences by shifting from “input” and “output” to “x” and “y” and adding the representation of a graph for the function values. This permits students to wonder and explore how changing different parameters in the function will impact the outputs, the table of values, and the graph. </p>

<h3>Launch</h3>
<p><li>Circulate as students work on part 3. If some groups seem behind, offer assistance if they have questions. </li></p>
<p><li>After 5 minutes or so, give students a time update that they should be on to #4.  </li></p>
<p><li>When groups have finished, bring the class together for a whole-class discussion. Have four different students share their responses to #6.</li></p>

In general, students might have provided responses similar to:
    <br>a. The addition operation impacted the graph by moving it up or down. Adding more makes the graph move up. 
    <br>b. The subtraction operation impacted the graph by moving it up or down. Subtracting more makes the graph move down. 
    <br>c. The multiplication operation impacted the graph by changing how steep the line was and whether it increased or decreased (moving from left to right on the graph). Multiplying more makes the graph steeper up and down. 
    <br>d. The division operation impacted the graph by changing how steep the line was and whether it increased or decreased (moving to the right on the graph). Dividing more makes the graph flatter.

<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>
  Ask students to answer the following question on an exit ticket. Review after class to determine student misunderstandings and address in a subsequent day's warm up. <br>
  1.    What is a function?<br>
  2.    What are the different ways a function can be represented? 
</p>

<p>Sample student responses: </p>
<p>A function describes the relationship between an input and an output. Every input has a single output, no matter how many times you put it through the function. Different inputs could have the same output though. A function is a rule that takes an input, does something to it, and makes an output.</p> 
<p>A function can be represented with words, table of values, list of points, a graph, or an equation.</p>

<p>Optional extension: Play with the game! Challenge yourself to figure out the mystery functions. They get tricky when you have two or three operations. Does your rule match the simulation's rule? Can there be more than one answer? </p>
