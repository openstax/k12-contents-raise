<p>To help students&rsquo; understanding of key points from the lesson, discuss each of the following ways to factor trinomials:</p>
<ul>
  <li> To factor a trinomial of the form \(x^2 + bx + c\), undo FOIL to find the binomial factors: </li>
  <ul>
    <li> Write the factors as two binomials with the first terms \(x\). </li>
    <li> Find two numbers that multiply to \(c\) and add to \(b\). </li>
    <li> Use these numbers as the last terms of the binomial factors. </li>
    <li> Check by multiplying the factors together. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> To factor a trinomial of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\), use the trial and error method: </li>
  <ul>
    <li> Factor any GCF. </li>
    <li> Find all the factor pairs of the first term. </li>
    <li> Find all the factor pairs of the third term.</li>
    <li> Test all the possible combinations of the factors until the correct product is found. </li>
    <li> Check by multiplying the factors together. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> For another way to factor a trinomial of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\), use the &ldquo;\(ac\)&rdquo; method: </li>
  <ul>
    <li> This method works on any trinomial of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\). </li>
    <li> Factor any GCF. </li>
    <li> Find the product \(ac\). </li>
    <li> Find two numbers, \(m\) and \(n\), that multiply to \(ac\) and add to \(b\). </li>
    <li> Split the middle term using \(m\) and \(n\): \(ax^2 + mx + nx + c\).</li>
    <li> Factor by grouping. </li>
    <li> Check by multiplying the factors together. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> To factor a polynomial that does not appear to be written in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\), use substitution: </li>
  <ul>
    <li> Factor any GCF. </li>
    <li> Substitute \(u\) for a common expression in the first terms. </li>
    <li> Factor as if the trinomial is of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\). </li>
    <li> Replace \(u\) with the original value. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
