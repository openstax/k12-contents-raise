<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this opening lesson, students recall the meaning of functions (which was introduced in grade 8) and encounter examples of functions and their representations in context.</p>
<p>Students consider why certain relationships could be seen as functions while others could not be. By analyzing tables and graphs that represent both functions and non-functions, and by interpreting descriptions of each situation, students are reminded that a function assigns exactly one output value to each input. If an input could have more than one possible output, then the relationship cannot be a function.</p>
<p>As they analyze and sketch graphs of functions, students are also reminded that each point on a graph represents an input-output pair of the function. They interpret coordinates on a graph of a function in terms of the quantities in the situation represented.</p>
<p>Students practice making sense of problems and persevere in solving them as they look for and explain correspondences between verbal descriptions, tables, and graphs. They engage in aspects of modeling as they identify input and output variables in real-life situations and create representations of their relationships.</p>
<p>The work here prepares students to describe and talk about functions more formally in upcoming lessons.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Interpret descriptions and graphs of functions in context.</li>
  <li>Understand that a relationship between two quantities is a function if there is only one possible output for each input.</li>
  <li>Use words and graphs to represent relationships that are functions, including identifying the independent and dependent variables.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Explain when a relationship between two quantities is a function.</li>
  <li>Identify independent and dependent variables in a function, and use words and graphs to represent the function.</li>
  <li>Explain what descriptions and graphs of functions tell us about situations.</li>
</ul>
