<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this opening lesson, students recall the meaning of functions (which was introduced in grade 8) and encounter
  examples of functions and their representations in context.</p>
<p>Students consider why certain relationships could be seen as functions while others could not be. By analyzing tables
  and graphs that represent both functions and non-functions, and by interpreting descriptions of each situation,
  students are reminded that a function assigns exactly one output value to each input. If an input could have more than
  one possible output, then the relationship cannot be a function.</p>
<p>As they analyze and sketch graphs of functions, students are also reminded that each point on a graph represents an
  input-output pair of the function. They interpret coordinates on a graph of a function in terms of the quantities in
  the situation represented.</p>
<p>Students practice making sense of problems and persevere in solving them as they look for and explain correspondences
  between verbal descriptions, tables, and graphs. They engage in aspects of modeling as they identify input and output
  variables in real-life situations and create representations of their relationships.</p>
<p>The work here prepares students to describe and talk about functions more formally in upcoming lessons.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Interpret descriptions and graphs of functions in context.</li>
  <li>Understand that a relationship between two quantities is a function if there is only one possible output for each
    input.</li>
  <li>Use words and graphs to represent relationships that are functions, including identifying the independent and
    dependent variables.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Explain when a relationship between two quantities is a function.</li>
  <li>Identify independent and dependent variables in a function, and use words and graphs to represent the function.
  </li>
  <li>Explain what descriptions and graphs of functions tell us about situations.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are
  only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.
  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A2(C) learn new language structures, expressions, and basic and academic vocabulary heard during classroom
    instruction and interactions </li>
  <li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and
    reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
  <li>A3(F) ask and give information ranging from using a very limited bank of high-frequency, high-need, concrete
    vocabulary, including key words and expressions needed for basic communication in academic and social contexts, to
    using abstract and content-based vocabulary during extended speaking assignments</li>
  <li>A3(I) adapt spoken language appropriately for formal and informal purposes </li>
  <li>A3(J) respond orally to information presented in a wide variety of print, electronic, audio, and visual media to
    build and reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
  <li>A4(G) demonstrate comprehension of increasingly complex English by participating in shared reading, retelling, or
    summarizing material, responding to questions, and taking notes commensurate with content area and grade level needs
  </li>
