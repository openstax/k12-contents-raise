<h3>Optional Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>This optional activity gives students another opportunity to represent the quantities in a situation with a table and a graph, identify key features of the graph, and interpret those features in terms of the situation.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>The following are some videos that show the same clip of a ball being dropped, but played back at different speeds. Show one or more of the videos for all to see. Before showing the videos, ask students to think about what information or quantities to look for while watching the videos.</p>

<ul>
  <li>At the original speed:
    Video Tennis Ball Drop (Full Speed)

  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>At half speed:
    Video Tennis Ball Drop (Half Speed)
    <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="275" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/313399597" title="Half Speed" width="550"></iframe>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>At quarter speed:
    Video Tennis Ball Drop (Quarter Speed)
    <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="275" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/313399606" title="Quarter Speed" width="550"></iframe>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If possible, allow students to replay the videos several times to help them sketch as accurate a graph as possible. Alternatively, give students individual access to the interactive applet, if available.</p>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<p>Your teacher will show you one or more videos of a tennis ball being dropped. Here are some still images of the situation.</p>
<p>The height of the ball is a function of time. Suppose the height is \(h\) feet, \(t\) seconds after the ball is dropped.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Use the blank coordinate plane to sketch a graph of the height of the tennis ball as a function of time.
    To help you get started, here are some pictures and a table.</li>

    \((0,6)\) is the \(y\)-intercept. It is the height from which the tennis ball is dropped. \((0.54,0)\), \((1.48,0)\), and \((2.25,0)\) are three of the horizontal intercepts. They represent the times at which the ball hits the ground.</li>

  <li>For example: <br>
    The maximum value of the function is 6, at \(t=0\). The height from which the ball is dropped, 6 feet, is its greatest height. The minimum value is 0, at multiple points when the tennis ball hits the ground. </li>

<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<div>
  <p>Use this routine to help students improve their verbal and written responses to the question, &ldquo;Find the maximum and minimum values of the function. Explain what they tell us about the tennis ball.&rdquo; Give students time to meet with 2&ndash;3 partners to share and get feedback on their responses. The listener should press for detail and precision in language by asking, &ldquo;Can you say that a different way?&rdquo;; &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;; or &ldquo;Can you show this on the table, graph, and video?&rdquo; Invite students to go back and revise or refine their written explanation based on the feedback from their peers. This will help students uncover any gaps in their interpretation of a graph, fine-tune their understanding of what key graphical features represent, and express their interpretation more clearly and precisely.</p>
</div>
<h4>Student-Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>If you only see the still images of the ball and not the video of the ball bouncing, can you accurately graph the height of the ball as a function of time? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</p>
<h4>Extension Student Response</h4>
<p>For example: No, each still image gives the position of the ball at a different time, or one point on the graph that represents height as a function of time. But without the video, we would not know what is happening at the time the image is taken: Is the ball going up? Is it coming down? Is it at one of its peaks?</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may mistake the horizontal axis on the graph to represent horizontal distance rather than time. Because the movement of the bouncing ball is primarily up and down (except toward the end, when it began rolling), these students might sketch a graph that is essentially a series of overlapping vertical segments. Ask them to revisit the input variable and what the horizontal axis represents. Then, ask them to plot some points for different values of \(t\).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Discuss how students translated the movement of the dropped ball into a graph and the connections between the graph and the situation. Ask questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Which parts of the ball&rsquo;s movement did you find easier to plot more precisely? Which parts require estimating?&rdquo; (The original position of the ball when it was released and the points when it hit the ground were easier to plot because they were more distinct and obvious. The points when the ball reached a peak and changed direction required a bit of estimation. The points between the peaks and the bounces were mainly estimated.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;In this case, the horizontal intercepts are also the minimums of the graph. Why is that?&rdquo; (The ball could not have a height that is less than 0. The lowest point it could be is 0 feet.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;What happened to the output value, \(h\), as the input value, \(t\), increased?&rdquo; (Overall, the output decreased as \(t\) increased, but there were intervals&mdash;whenever the ball bounced up&mdash;in which the height of the ball increased as time increased.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If time permits, discuss students&rsquo; responses to the last two questions.</p>
