<p>Display the equation \(f(x)=-3x^2+24x&minus;36\) for all to see. Ask students to think about features of a graph of function \(f\), as many as they can, without creating a graph. To scaffold this work, consider displaying the list of features of a graph.</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> \(y\)-intercept </li>
  <li> \(x\)-intercepts </li>
  <li> Coordinates of vertex </li>
</ul>
<p>Solicit responses from students on how they found each feature of a graph of \(f\).</p>
<p>Highlight that the \(x\)-intercepts and the coordinates of the vertex aren't easy to spot in the standard form of the expression as given, but we have techniques to rewrite the expression in other forms.</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> To rewrite in factored form, we can use the distributive property twice: </li>
</ul>
<p>\(-3x^2+24x&minus;36\)<br>
  \(-3(x^2&minus;8x+12)\)<br>
  \(-3(x&minus;2)(x&minus;6)\)</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Once the expression is in factored form, we can tell that the \(x\)-intercepts of a graph of \(x\) are at \((2,0)\) and \((6,0)\). </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> To rewrite in vertex form, we can complete the square: </li>
</ul>
<p>\(-3(x^2&minus;8x+12)\)<br>
  \(-3(x^2&minus;8x+12+4&minus;4)\)<br>
  \(-3(x^2&minus;8x+16&minus;4)\)<br>
  \(-3((x&minus;4)^2&minus;4)\)<br>
  \(-3(x&minus;4)^2+12\)</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Once the expression is in vertex form, we can tell that the vertex of a graph of \(f\) is at \((4,12)\). </li>
</ul>
<p>Time permitting, demonstrate that with all of this information, we can now sketch a reasonable graph of \(f\) by hand.</p>
