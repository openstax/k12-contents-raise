<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Explain the meaning of the terms in a quadratic expression that represents the height of a falling object. </li>
  <li> Use tables, graphs, and equations to represent the height of a falling object. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 7.5.1: Numerical Patterns </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you spent time examining a given table and discovered predictable patterns of the values. The big thing you learned is that the discovered patterns help determine the function rule. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 7.5.2: A Time-Distance Quadratic Model </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you built a very simple quadratic model using given time-distance data of a free-falling rock. The big thing you learned is that the motion of a falling object is commonly modeled with a quadratic function. </li>
    <li> 7.5.2: Self Check </li>
    <li> 7.5.2: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 7.5.3: Distance as a Quadratic Function of Elapsed Time </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you continued to explore how quadratic functions can model the movement of a falling object by evaluating the function seen earlier in the lesson. Then you built a new function to represent the distance from the ground of a falling object \(t\) seconds after it is dropped. </li>
    <li> 7.5.3: Self Check </li>
    <li> 7.5.3: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 7.5.4: A Quadratic Expression that Represents the Relationship Between Distance and Time </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you wrote expressions that represent the distance in feet of an object when it falls after \(t\) seconds. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following<strong> practice</strong>:</p>

  <li> 7.5.5: Practice </li>
