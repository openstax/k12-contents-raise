<p dir="ltr">In this lesson, you will begin to learn how to write equations to model various situations. For instance, modeling scenarios with equations can help you figure out how much you need to pay for one pound of blueberries or how much tax you need to pay when buying a meal at a restaurant.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tell which quantities in a situation can vary and which ones cannot.</li>
  <li>Use letters and numbers to write equations representing the relationships in a situation.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
