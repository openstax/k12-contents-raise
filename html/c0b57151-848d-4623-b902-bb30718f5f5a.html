<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students gain a better understanding of correlation coefficients by taking turns with a partner to match scatter plots and correlation coefficients. Students trade roles, explaining their thinking and listening, providing opportunities to explain their reasoning and critique the reasoning of others.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Tell students that the \(r\)-value is called a correlation coefficient. A correlation coefficient is one way to measure the strength of a linear relationship. Tell students:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>The sign of \(r\) is the same as the sign of the slope of the best fit line.</li>
  <li>The values for \(r\) go from &ndash;1 to 1, inclusive.</li>
  <li>The closer \(r\) is to 1 or &ndash;1, the stronger the linear relationship between the variables.</li>
  <li>The closer \(r\) is to 0, the weaker the linear relationship between the variables.</li>
</ol>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Tell students that for each scatter plot, one partner finds the associated correlation coefficient and explains why they think it goes with that scatter plot. The other partner&rsquo;s job is to listen and make sure they agree. If they don&rsquo;t agree, the partners discuss until they come to an agreement. For the next scatter plot, the students swap roles. If necessary, demonstrate this protocol before students start working.</p>

  <p><em>Representation: Develop Language and Symbols. </em>Display or provide charts with symbols and meanings. Create a chart of the \(r\)-value ranging from &ndash;1 to 1. Label with the corresponding features of the various domains of the \(r\)-value. Select students to label the chart with the corresponding descriptors for each domain. Small sketches or print outs of example scatter plots can be added to the appropriate areas of the chart.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Thinking back to the last activity, you learned about the \(r\)-value. Write these characteristics about the \(r\)-value.</p>
<p>The \(r\)-value is called a correlation coefficient. A correlation coefficient is one way to measure the strength of a linear relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>The sign of \(r\) is the same as the sign of the slope of the best fit line.</li>
  <li>The values for \(r\) go from &ndash;1 to 1 and include &ndash;1 and 1.</li>
  <li>The closer \(r\) is to 1 or &ndash;1, the stronger the linear relationship between the variables.</li>
  <li>The closer \(r\) is to 0, the weaker the linear relationship between the variables.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take turns with your partner to match a scatter plot with a correlation coefficient. For each match you find, explain to your partner how you know itâ€™s a match. For each match your partner finds, listen carefully to their explanation. If you disagree, discuss your thinking and work to reach an agreement.</p>

<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
  <br>
<h4>Are you ready for more?</h4>
<p>Jada wants to know if the speed that people walk is correlated with their texting speed. To investigate this, she measured the distance, in feet, that 5 of her friends walked in 30 seconds and the number of characters they texted during that time. Each of the 5 friends took 4 walks for a total of 20 walks. Here are the results of the first 20 walks.</p>

  <li>What do you notice about the 2 scatter plots?
    <p><br>
      <strong>Answer: </strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. I noticed that in the second scatter plot, the students traveled longer distances. In addition, the students seemed to type more characters for any given distance in the second scatter plot than in the first scatter plot.<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>Jada noticed that her friends walked farther and texted faster during the last 20 walks than they did during the first 20 walks. Since both were faster, she predicts that the correlation coefficient of the line of best fit for the last 20 walks will be closer to \(-1\) than the correlation coefficient of the line of best fit for the first 20 walks. Do you agree with Jada? Be prepared to show your reasoning.
    <p><br>
      <strong>Answer: </strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. I do not agree with Jada. The correlation coefficient deals with how closely the line of best fit models the data. The comparison between the walking distance and the number of characters texted is about the slope of the line, not the fit of the line. <br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>Use technology to find an equation of the line of best fit for each data set.
    <p><br>
      <strong>Answer: </strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. The line of best fit for scatter plot 1 is \(y=-0.8547x +218.6053\). The line of best fit for scatter plot 2 is \(y=-0.4658x +222.1704\).&nbsp;<br><br></p>
  </li>
  <li>The correlation coefficient for the first line of best fit is \(-0.95\), and the second line of best fit is \(-0.68\). Was your answer to question 2 correct? Why do you think the correlation coefficients for the two data sets are so different? Be prepared to show your reasoning.
    <p><br>
      <strong>Answer: </strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. I think the correlation coefficients are different because the data in the second scatter plot are more scattered than the data in the first scatter plot. On average, the data in the first scatter plot are much closer to the line of best fit than the data in the second scatter plot.<br><br></p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may struggle with starting to match the scatter plots with a correlation coefficient. Guide students by asking them about the sign of the correlation coefficients. Ask them to sort the cards into groups that make sense and use that to connect to the correlation coefficient values. Ask them: &ldquo;How does the sign of the correlation coefficient relate to the linear model?&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>The purpose of this discussion is for students to understand that the correlation coefficient is a formal way to quantify the strength of a linear relationship between variables, and that the sign of the correlation coefficient tells you whether the variables show a positive or negative association.</p>
<p>Here are some questions for discussion.</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;What does the sign of the correlation coefficient tell you about the data?&rdquo; (If it is negative, then \(y\) tends to decrease as \(x\) increases. If it is positive, then \(y\) tends to increase as \(x\) increases.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;What does it mean to have a correlation coefficient of 1 or &ndash;1?&rdquo; (It means that the data are perfectly linear and are fit exactly by a linear function.)</li>

  <h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
    <p><em>Speaking: MLR8 Discussion Supports.</em> Use this routine to support whole-class discussion. Each time a student shares their ideas about the meaning of the correlation coefficient, press for details by requesting students to challenge an idea, elaborate on an idea, or give an example. Revoice student responses to demonstrate mathematical language use by applying appropriate language. Call students&rsquo; attention to any words or phrases that helped clarify the original statement. If needed, practice phrases or words through choral response. This provides more students with an opportunity to produce language as they share their ideas about the relationship between data represented in scatter plots and correlation coefficients.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Try It: Correlation Coefficient</h4>
<p>The scatter plot below displays data on the number of defects per 100 cars and a measure of customer satisfaction (on a scale from 1 to 1,000, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction) for the 33 brands of cars sold in the United States in 2009.<br></p>
<p><img alt class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="315" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/5215ac5b50f67642084aa6de48c8e0302879f79b" width="350"><br></p>
<p>Which of the following is the value of the correlation coefficient for this data set: \(r = -0.95\), \(r = -0.24\), \(r = 0.83\), or \(r = 1.00\)? Explain why you selected this value.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p>Your answers may vary, but here are some samples.</p>
<p>\(r = -0.24\)</p>
<p>There is not a strong pattern of a linear relationship with this scatter plot. Even though there is a weak relationship, there is a general pattern that as the number of defects increases, the satisfaction rating tends to decrease. As a result, the value of \(r\) is negative and close to zero. Based on the values provided, the best estimate is \(r = -0.24\).</p>
