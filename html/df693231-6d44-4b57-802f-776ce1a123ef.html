<h2>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h2>
<h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>
<div class="body">
  <p>At the end of the school year, all students in the ninth grade are invited to an ice cream party. Use the skills you learned from planning a pizza party to answer the following:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Write an expression that could represent an estimated cost for the party. Use at least one letter. State what each part of the expression represents.</li>
    <li>Choose a letter in your expression. Describe the values that would be reasonable for the quantity that the letter represents.</li>
  </ol>
  <ol>
  </ol>
</div>
<h3>Student Response</h3>
<div class="body">
  <ol>
    <li>Sample responses:<ul>
        <li><span>\( 1.50n + 0.08(1.50n) \)</span>. There are&nbsp;<span>\( n \)</span>&nbsp;students in the ninth grade. A packaged ice cream cone is about&nbsp;<span>$</span>1.50, and tax is about 8%.</li>
        <li><span>\( \frac {125}{6} \cdot 5 + 6(3) + p \)</span>. There are 125 students in the ninth grade. Suppose a tub of ice cream costs&nbsp;<span>$</span>5 and is enough for 6 students. A pack of 24 cones costs about&nbsp;<span>$</span>3, and 6 packs are needed. A pack of 150 paper napkins costs&nbsp;<span>\( p \)</span>&nbsp;dollars.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Sample responses:<ul>
        <li>A whole number between 90 and 100 is a reasonable value for the number of students in ninth grade, or&nbsp;\( 90 \leq n \geq 100 \).</li>
        <li>A number less than $4 but more than $1 is reasonable for the cost of a pack of paper napkins, or&nbsp;\( 1 &lt; n &lt; 4 \).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Response to Student Thinking</h3>
  <h4>More Chances</h4>
  <p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
