<h2>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h2>
<h3>Student Facing Statement</h3>
<div class="body">
  <p>At the end of the school year, all students in the ninth grade are invited to an ice cream party. Use the skills you learned from planning a pizza party to answer the following:</p>
   
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="1">
    <li>Identify and describe at least one letter that you will use to represent the cost of something you need to buy for the party. </li>
  </ol>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
    <p>Your answer may vary, but here are some examples:</p>
      <ul> 
        <li>t = number of different toppings one student selects</li>
        <li>s = number of different scoops of ice cream one student requests</li>
      <li> n = total number of ninth grade students at party </li>      
    <li>p = cost of paper products like napkins, bowls, and spoons</li>
      </ul>
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
    <li>Write an expression that could represent an estimated cost for the party using that letter. Note, you may use other letters, too, if needed. 
    </li>
  </ol>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
    <p>Your answer may vary, but here are some examples:</p>
      <ul> 
        <li>\((0.75s + 1.5t)n =\) total cost</li>
        <li>\(4.00n + 15 =\) total cost</li>
        <li>\(1.50n+0.08(1.50n) =\) total cost</li>
        <li>\(\frac{125}{6} \cdot 5 + 6(3) + p =\) total cost</li>
  
      </ul>
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
    <li>Describe your expression in words.
    </li>
  </ol>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>
      Your answer may vary, but here are some examples:
  
</p>      <ul> 
        <li>Each scoop of ice cream costs $0.75 and the cost of each topping is $1.50 which sum to the cost of one bowl of ice cream. Now we multiply the cost of one bowl of ice cream by the number of students in the class. </li>
        <li>A flat cost of $4 per bowl of ice cream for each student plus a charge of $15 for the bowls, spoons, and napkins.</li>
        <li>There are \(n\) students in the ninth grade. A packaged ice cream cone is about $1.50, and tax is about 8%.</li>
        <li>There are 125 students in the ninth grade. Suppose a tub of ice cream costs $5 and is enough for 6 students. A pack of 24 cones costs about $3, and 6 packs are needed. A pack of 150 paper napkins costs \(p\) dollars.</li>
  
      </ul>



  <h3>Response to Student Thinking</h3>
  <h4>More Chances</h4>
  <p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
