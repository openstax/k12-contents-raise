<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>This lesson continues to investigate the relationship between the parameters \(a\) and \(b\) in the expression \(a \cdot b^x\) and a graph representing the function \(f\) given by \(f(x)=a \cdot b^x\). Students start by identifying a function represented by a given graph and using the graph to make sense of a situation. They also examine two abstract graphs, with unlabeled axes, and decide which one represents a given situation. This level of abstraction is appropriate at this stage. It gives students an opportunity to apply what they have learned about the relationship between an exponential context and its graph and to use graphs to better interpret the contexts. In both cases, they rely on their understanding of the connections between the parameters in an exponential expression and the features of an exponential graph to answer questions. Connecting exponential functions to real-world situations helps students understand why it is important to learn about this type of function.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Identify the initial value and growth factor of an exponential function given a graph showing two points with non-consecutive input values. </li>
  <li> Interpret the intersection of the graphs of two functions that represent a situation. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Explain the meaning of the intersection of the graphs of two functions in terms of the situations they represent. </li>
  <li> Write an equation for the function given two points on a graph of an exponential function. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment </li>
  <li>A2(I) demonstrate listening comprehension of increasingly complex spoken English by following directions, retelling or summarizing spoken messages, responding to questions and requests, collaborating with peers, and taking notes commensurate with content and grade-level needs</li>
  <li>A4(D) use prereading supports such as graphic organizers, illustrations, and pretaught topic-related vocabulary and other prereading activities to enhance comprehension of written text</li>
  <li>A5(B) write using newly acquired basic vocabulary and content-based grade-level vocabulary</li>
</ul>
