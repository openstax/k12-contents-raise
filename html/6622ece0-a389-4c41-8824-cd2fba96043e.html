<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity gives students a concrete experience with a quadratic relationship in a familiar geometric context.
  Given a rectangle with a fixed perimeter, students experiment with how changes to one side of the rectangle affect its
  area. Along the way, they notice that as one length increases, the area does not continue to increase. Instead, at
  some point, it begins to decrease.</p>
<p>Students are not expected to write an equation such as \(l \cdot (25 &minus; l)\) for the area of the
  rectangle. At this point, informal observations on how the values are changing are sufficient. Students will have
  ample opportunities throughout this unit to examine the formal structure of quadratic relationships in depth.</p>
<p>As students work, encourage them to consider side lengths that are not whole numbers. Look for students who organize
  their work in different systematic ways and select them to share their work later.</p>
<p>Considering the relationship between the dimensions and area of a rectangle given a fixed perimeter requires students
  to reason abstractly and quantitatively. Making spreadsheet technology available gives students an opportunity to
  choose appropriate tools strategically.</p>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<p>Display a rectangle for all to see and label the sides with some lengths. Ask students to find the perimeter of the
  rectangle and the area of the region enclosed by this rectangle. Then, ask for the definitions of perimeter and area.
  Before beginning the activity, make sure students are clear about the distinction between the two measures&mdash;the
  perimeter is the distance all the way around a region, and the area is the number of unit squares that cover a region
  without gaps or overlaps.</p>
<p>Give students access to graph paper and tell students that they can use graph paper for the first question if they
  wish. Also provide access to calculators. Some students may benefit from using them to get to the interesting part of
  the task.</p>
<p>For the second question, some students may choose to create a spreadsheet to keep track of (and perhaps sort) the
  lengths, widths, and areas of the rectangle. Make a spreadsheet tool available, in case it is requested.</p>

<p>Your answers will vary. Did you consider organizing your lengths, widths, and areas into a table? For example:</p>
<table class="os-raise-wideequaltable">

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2" v>
  <li>Find the length and width of a rectangle that would produce the largest possible area. Explain why you think that
    pair of length and width gives the largest possible area.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> When the length and width are each 12.5 meters, the area is the largest (156.25 square
    meters). A table shows that as the rectangular shape gets closer and closer to being a square, the area gets larger.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may exclude a rectangle with side lengths 12.5 and 12.5 from their diagrams of Noah&rsquo;s garden,
  possibly because they think a square is not a rectangle, or possibly because they only generate whole numbers.
  Emphasize that a square is a type of rectangle that happens to have four sides of equal length. Prompt them to think
  of the definition of a rectangle and explain why a square meets all the criteria for a rectangle.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Display the work of a student who organized lengths, widths, and areas in a table. If no students did so, generate a
  table as a class. An example is shown here. (Pairs of length and area values will be needed in the next activity.)</p>

  <br>
<p>Discuss with students:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>&ldquo;What do you notice about the relationship between the length and the width?&rdquo; (They add up to 25. Each
    time the length increases by 1, the width decreases by 1. The relationship is linear.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;What do you notice about the relationship between the length and the area?&rdquo; (As the length increases
    from 1 to 24, the area increases and then decreases. The relationship is not linear.) </li>
</ul>
<p>Ask students to describe the rectangle they found to have the largest area and how they went about finding it. It is
  likely that many students will say that it has side lengths of 12 and 13 since these are the whole-number values that
  produce the greatest area. If no students tried 12.5 and 12.5, ask them to compute this area.</p>
<p>Solicit some ideas from students on how the area is related to the length. Ask questions such as:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>&ldquo;How do we know if 12.5 and 12.5 would indeed produce the greatest area?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Do you think going from 5 to 8 meters in length would produce a rectangle with a greater area? What about
    going from 15 to 18? Why or why not?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Tell students that we&rsquo;ll try to get a better idea of what&rsquo;s happening between the side lengths and the
  area of the rectangle by plotting some points in the next activity, &ldquo;Plotting Measurements.&rdquo;
