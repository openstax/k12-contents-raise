<h4>Activity P8.2: Converting Between Factored Form and Standard Form</h4>
<p>You have learned strategies for writing a quadratic expression in its factored form and standard form. In each round of this activity, you and your partner will be given equivalent quadratic expressions in different forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal of each round is to write the quadratic expression as it has been given to your partner. If your expression is in factored form, write it in standard form. If your expression is in standard form, write it in factored form. At the end of each round, compare the expressions with your partner without revealing the expressions for future rounds.</p>
<p>If, in any round, you need help, you may ask your partner to explain the next step without revealing the solution.</p>
<p>Proceed from rounds 1 to 6 while discussing your thinking if there is any disagreement.</p>
