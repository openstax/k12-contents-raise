<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity </h4>
<p>Diego&rsquo;s club earns money for charity when members of the club perform community service after school. For each student who does community service, the club earns $5. There are 12 students in the club.</p>
<p>The total dollar amount earned, \(E\), is a function of the number of members who perform community service, \(n\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Is 5 a possible input value? Why or why not? </li>
  <p> <strong>ANSWER: </strong>\(n=5\) is possible. It means that 5 students perform community service. </p>
  <li> Is 24 a possible output value? Why or why not? </li>
  <p> <strong>ANSWER: </strong> No, 24 is not possible as an output value. An output value has to be a multiple of 5. </p>
  <li> Describe the domain of this function. </li>
  <p> <strong>ANSWER: </strong> All integers from 0 to 12</p>
  <li> Describe the range of this function.</li>
  <p> <strong>ANSWER: </strong> Multiples of 5 from 0 to 60</p>
</ol>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
