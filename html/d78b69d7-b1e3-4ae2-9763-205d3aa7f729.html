<p>Note: Fractions, decimals, and negative numbers are all allowed as input values but may be eliminated depending on the context of the problem that the function represents.</p>
<h4>Try It: Finding Possible Input Values</h4>
<p>Elena runs at a constant speed. Her distance, \(D\), in miles is a function of the time, \(t\), in minutes. Her running distance is represented by the function \(D(t)=9t\).</p>

<p>Here is how to find the possible input values:</p>
<p>&ndash;7 is not possible because she cannot run for a negative amount of time</p>
<p>\(\frac23\) is possible. However, it is not always reasonable because it stands for \(\frac23\) of one minute. It is important to always look at the entire problem to see if there are any other restrictions, like a minimum amount of time running.</p>
<p>45 and 60.5 are both possible input values because she could run for 45 minutes or 60.5 minutes.</p>
<p>How did you do? Know that you learn more from wrong answers than from right answers! Wrong answers help us find flaws in our thinking. Take a minute to think about <em>why</em> you got the question wrong. Then you won&rsquo;t get this type of question wrong again!</p>
