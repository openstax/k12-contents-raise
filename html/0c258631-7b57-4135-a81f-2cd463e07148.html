<p>Tyler and Jada each designed their own custom trail mix using two of these ingredients. They wrote inequalities and created graphs to represent their constraints.</p>

  <li>\(4.76x\;+\;6.67y\;\leq\;400\)</li>
  <li>\(0.67x + 0.07y &lt;30\)</li>

<p>Use the inequalities and graphs to answer these questions about each student's trail mix. Be prepared to explain your reasoning.</p>
<ol>
  <li> Which two ingredients did they choose? </li>
  <li> What do their variables represent? </li>
  <li> What does each constraint mean? </li>
  <li> Which graph represents which constraint? </li>
  <li> Name one possible combination of ingredients for their trail mix. </li>
</ol>
<h4>Activity P2.3: Perform Mathematical Modeling</h4>

<p>It's time to design your own trail mix!</p>
<ol>
  <li> Choose two ingredients that you like to eat. (You can choose from the ingredients in the previous activity, or you can look up nutrition information for other ingredients.) </li>
  <li> Think about the constraints for your trail mix. What do you want to be true about its calories, protein, sugar, fat, or fiber? </li>
  <li> Write inequalities to represent your constraints. Then, graph the inequalities. <img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/04008b8056fd0131e83e7d1f4598ab1d60b92222" alt="Blank coordinate plane with grid, origin O."/></li>
  <li> Is it possible to make a trail mix that meets all your constraints using your ingredients? If not, make changes to your constraints or your ingredients and record them here. </li>
  <li> Write a possible combination of ingredients for your trail mix. </li>
</ol>
<p>Pause here so your teacher can review your work and give further instructions for displaying your work.</p>
