<h3>Narrative</h3>
<p>In this culminating project, you will integrate the ideas from the unit and engage in multiple aspects of mathematical modeling.
</p>
<br>
<p>In the first activity, you interpret and analyze given models that represent the constraints and conditions in a situation. In the second activity, you create your own models after specifying quantities of interest, identifying relevant information, and setting the constraints.
</p>

<h4>Project Activities</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Determining a Solution to Inequalities</li>
  <li>Interpret a Set of Mathematical Models</li>
  <li>Perform Mathematical Modeling</li>
</ol>


<h4>Learning Targets</h4>
<p>When you finish this project, you will have demonstrated how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Interpret inequalities and graphs in a mathematical model.
  </li>
  <li>Choose variables, specify the constraints, and write inequalities to create a mathematical model.
  </li>
</ul>
