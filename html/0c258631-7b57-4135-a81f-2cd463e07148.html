<h3>Narrative</h3>
<p>In this culminating lesson, you will integrate the ideas from the unit and engage in multiple aspects of mathematical modeling.
</p>
<br>
<p>In the first activity, you interpret and analyze given models that represent the constraints and conditions in a situation. In the second activity, you create your own models after specifying quantities of interest, identifying relevant information, and setting the constraints.
