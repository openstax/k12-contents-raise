<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm-up prepares students to work with expressions involving negative exponents. Students have studied exponents and their properties in grade 8 and encountered negative exponents at that time. The goal here is to review the fact that for integer exponents \(m\) and \(n\) and a non-zero base \(b\),&nbsp;this property holds: \(b^m\cdot b^n=b^{m+n}\).</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>How would you rewrite each of the following as an equivalent expression with a single exponent?</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> \(2^4\cdot 2^0\)<br><br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(2^4\)
  </li><br>
  <li> \(2^4\cdot 2^{-1}\)<br><br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(2^3\)
  </li><br>
  <li> \(2^4\cdot 2^{-3}\)<br><br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(2^1\)
  </li><br>
  <li> \(2^4\cdot 2^{-4}\)<br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(2^0\)
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Review, if needed, the conventions that \(2^0=1\) and \(2^{-1}=\frac12\), emphasizing that these conventions guarantee that \(2^a\cdot 2^b=2^{a+b}\) for any two integers \(a\) and \(b\).&nbsp;</p>
