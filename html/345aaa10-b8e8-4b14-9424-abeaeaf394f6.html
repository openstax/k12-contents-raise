<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>A school choir needs to make T-shirts for its 75 members and has set aside some money in their budget to pay for
  them. The members of the choir decided to order from a printing company that charges&nbsp;$3 per shirt, plus
  a&nbsp;$50 fee for each color to be printed on the shirts.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Write an equation that represents the relationship between the number of T-shirts ordered, the number of colors on
    the shirts, and the total cost of the order. If you use a variable, specify what it represents.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>\( 75(3) + 50x = D \)&nbsp;(or equivalent).&nbsp;\( x \)&nbsp;represents the number of colors
  on the shirts.&nbsp;\( D \)&nbsp;represents the total cost in dollars.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>In this situation, which quantities do you think can vary? Which might be fixed?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is a sample: The cost of per shirt and the fee per color are
  fixed (they are set by the printing company). The number of colors on the shirts can vary, and so can the total cost,
  depending on the number of colors being printe</p>
</ol>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h4>More Chances</h4>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to
  slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance
  for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current
  understanding. Lessons 1.4 and 1.5 provide additional opportunities to analyze the meaning of variables in equations
  and write equations to represent a situation.</p>
