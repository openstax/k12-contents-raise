<p>The MLRs were selected because they are effective and practical for simultaneously learning mathematical practices, content, and language. A mathematical language routine is a structured but adaptable format for amplifying, assessing, and developing students' language.</p>
<p>The routines emphasize language use that is meaningful and purposeful rather than just about getting answers. These routines can be adapted to fit the content to support students in using and improving their English and disciplinary language use.</p>
<p>These routines facilitate attention to student language in ways that support &ldquo;in-the-moment teaching,&rdquo; peer assessment, and self-assessment. The feedback from these routines helps students revise and refine how they organize and communicate their own ideas and ask questions to clarify their understanding of others&rsquo; ideas.</p>
<p>The eight MLRs included in this curriculum are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> MLR 1: Stronger and Clearer Each Time </li>
  <li> MLR 2: Collect and Display </li>
  <li> MLR 3: Clarify, Critique, Correct </li>
  <li> MLR 4: Information Gap </li>
  <li> MLR 5: Co-Craft Questions </li>
  <li> MLR 6: Three Reads </li>
  <li> MLR 7: Compare and Connect </li>
  <li> MLR 8: Discussion Supports </li>

    <blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;To provide structured and interactive opportunity for students to revise and refine both their ideas and their verbal and written output&rdquo; (Zwiers, 2014).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The main idea is to have students think and write individually about a question, use a structured pairing strategy to have multiple opportunities to refine and clarify their response through conversation, and then finally revise their original written response.</p>
    <p>Subsequent conversations and second drafts should naturally show evidence of incorporating or addressing new ideas and language. They should also show evidence of refinement in precision, communication, expression, examples, and reasoning about mathematical concepts.</p>

    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Purpose</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&rdquo;To capture a variety of students&rsquo; oral words and phrases into a stable, collective reference&rdquo; (Dieckman 2017).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>The intent of MLR 2 is to stabilize the varied and fleeting language in use during mathematical work, in order for students&rsquo; own output to become a reference in developing mathematical language.</p>
    <p>The teacher listens for and scribes the language students use during partner, small group or whole class discussions using written words, diagrams and pictures. This collected output can be organized, revoiced, or explicitly connected to other languages in a display that all students can refer to, build on, or make connections with during future discussion or writing.</p>
    <p>Throughout the course of a unit (and beyond), teachers can reference the displayed language as a model, update and revise the display as student language changes, and make bridges between prior student language and new disciplinary language (Dieckman, 2017).</p>
    <p>This routine provides feedback for students in a way that supports sense-making while simultaneously increasing meta-awareness of language.</p>
    <p>It provides an opportunity to not only showcase connections between student ideas and new vocabulary, but also highlight examples of students using disciplinary language functions, beyond just vocabulary words.</p>

    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Purpose</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>To give students a piece of mathematical writing that is not their own to analyze, reflect on, and develop.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    <p>The intent of MLR 3 is to prompt student reflection with an incorrect, incomplete, or ambiguous written mathematical statement, and for students to improve upon the written work by correcting errors and clarifying meaning. Teachers can demonstrate how to effectively and respectfully critique the work of others with &ldquo;meta-think-alouds&rdquo; and pressing for details when necessary.</p>
    <p>This routine fortifies output and engages students in meta-awareness. More than just error analysis, this routine purposefully engages students in considering both the author&rsquo;s mathematical thinking as well as the features of their communication.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>To create a need for students to communicate (Gibbons, 2002).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    <p>MLR 4 allows teachers to facilitate meaningful interactions by positioning some students as holders of information that is needed by other students. The information is needed to accomplish a goal, such as solving a problem or winning a game.</p>
    <p>With an information gap, students need to orally (or visually) share ideas and information in order to bridge a gap and accomplish something that they could not have done alone. Teachers should demonstrate how to ask for and share information, how to justify a request for information, and how to clarify and elaborate on information.</p>
    <p>This routine cultivates conversation.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <br>
    <p> Through the MLR 5 routine, students are able to use conversation skills to generate, choose (argue for the best one), and improve questions and situations as well as develop meta-awareness of the language used in mathematical questions and problems.</p>

  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Purpose</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>To ensure that students know what they are being asked to do, create opportunities for students to reflect on the ways mathematical questions are presented, and equip students with tools used to actively make sense of mathematical situations and information (Kelemanik, Lucenta, &amp; Creighton, 2016).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    <p> In the MLR 6 routine, students are supported in reading a mathematical text, situation, or word problem three times, each with a particular focus.</p>
    <p>The intended question or main prompt is intentionally withheld until the third read so that students can concentrate on making sense of what is happening in the text before rushing to a solution or method.</p>
    <p>This routine supports reading comprehension, sense-making, and meta-awareness of mathematical language. It also supports negotiating information in a text with a partner through mathematical conversation.</p>

  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Purpose</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>To foster students&rsquo; meta-awareness as they identify, compare, and contrast different mathematical approaches and representations.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    <p> The MLR 7 routine leverages the powerful mix of disciplinary representations available in mathematics as a resource for language development. In this routine, students make sense of mathematical strategies other than their own by relating and connecting other approaches to their own.</p>
    <p>Students should be prompted to reflect on, and linguistically respond to, these comparisons (for example, exploring why or when one might do or say something a certain way, identifying and explaining correspondences between different mathematical representations or methods, or wondering how a certain concept compares or connects to other concepts).</p>
    <p>Be sure to demonstrate asking questions that students can ask each other, rather than asking questions to &ldquo;test&rdquo; understanding. Use &ldquo;think alouds&rdquo; to demonstrate the trial and error, or fits and starts of sense-making (similar to the way teachers think aloud to demonstrate reading comprehension).</p>
    <p>This routine supports metacognition and metalinguistic awareness, and also supports constructive conversations.</p>

  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Purpose</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>To support rich and inclusive discussions about mathematical ideas, representations, contexts, and strategies (Chapin, O&rsquo;Connor, &amp; Anderson, 2009).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    <p> Rather than another structured format, the examples provided in the MLR 8 routine are instructional moves that can be combined and used together with any of the other routines. They include multimodal strategies for helping students make sense of complex language, ideas, and classroom communication.</p>
    <p>The examples can be used to invite and incentivize more student participation, conversation, and meta-awareness of language. Eventually, as teachers continue to demonstrate, students should begin using these strategies themselves to prompt each other to engage more deeply in discussions.</p>
