<p>In this lesson, you will analyze and interpret given equations, write equations to represent relationships and constraints, and work to solve these equations. Ultimately, you will see that sometimes solutions to quadratic equations cannot be easily or precisely found by graphing or reasoning.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Recognize the factored form of a quadratic expression and know when it can be useful for solving problems. </li>
  <li> Use a graph to find the solutions to a quadratic equation but also know its limitations. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the<strong> activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
