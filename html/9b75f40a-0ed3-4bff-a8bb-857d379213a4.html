<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>The purpose of this activity is for students to informally assess the fit of various lines to data, to use technology
  to find the line of best fit, and to interpret the slope and vertical intercept of the linear model. The work connects
  to previous work because students created scatter plots and created linear models for the data. The work connects to
  upcoming work because students will use the correlation coefficient to describe the strength of the linear
  relationship.</p>
<p>When students sort scatter plots into linear and nonlinear categories, and when they organize lines of best fit by
  the goodness of fit, they look for and make use of structure because they are analyzing representations and structures
  closely and making connections. Students are reasoning abstractly and quantitatively when they interpret the meaning
  of the slope and vertical intercept in context.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Determine which linear model is a better fit for a given data set.</li>
  <li>Interpret (orally and in writing) the rate of change and vertical intercept for a linear model in everyday
    language.</li>
  <li>Use technology to generate the line of best fit, and use the equation representing the linear model to predict
    (extrapolate) and estimate (interpolate) values not given in the data set.</li>
  <li>Write linear models using slope and \(y\)-intercepts by hand from data in tables and graphs. </li>
  <li>Use linear models to make predictions. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>

<h4>Required Preparation</h4>
<p>Print and cut up slips for the <a

    target="_blank">card sort.</a> Prepare one copy of the blackline master for every group of 2 students. To find best
  fit lines, students will need access to technology that will compute the least-squares regression lines for a set of
  data.</p>
<p>Acquire devices that can run Desmos (recommended) or other graphing technology. It is ideal if each student has their
  own device.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>
<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson. Encourage students to look for
    these words and notice their use and meanings.</li>
  <li>Encourage students to use key vocabulary words in &ldquo;math talk&rdquo; and their written and oral explanations.
  </li>
  <li>Utilize a word wall. Sample cards are located here: <a

    <p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are
  only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.
  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and
    reinforce concept and language attainment
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(B) expand and internalize initial English vocabulary by learning and using high-frequency English words
    necessary for identifying and describing people, places, and objects, by retelling simple stories and basic
    information represented or supported by pictures, and by learning and using routine language needed for classroom
    communication
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(F) ask and give information ranging from using a very limited bank of high-frequency, high-need, concrete
    vocabulary, including key words and expressions needed for basic communication in academic and social contexts, to
    using abstract and content-based vocabulary during extended speaking assignments
