    <p>Disagree. Priya solved the equation using the reasoning we would use with the zero product property, but the zero product property only works if the product of two factors is 0. We can tell that 12 isn&rsquo;t a solution because \((12&minus;5)(12+1)\) is 91, not 7.</p>

      <li>Consider \(x^2&minus;10x=0\). Diego says that to solve we can just divide each side by \(x\) to get \(x&minus;10=0\), so the solution is 10. Mai says, &ldquo;I wrote the expression on the left in factored form, which gives \(x(x&minus;10)=0\), and ended up with two solutions: 0 and 10.&rdquo;</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Do you agree with either strategy? Explain your reasoning.</p>

    <p>Agree with Mai&rsquo;s strategy. By substituting 0 for \(x\) and then 10 for \(x\), you can see that they are both solutions to the original equation. Diego&rsquo;s strategy of dividing by a variable eliminates one of the solutions, leaving only one solution.</p>
