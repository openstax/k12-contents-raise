<h4>Comparing Outputs</h4>
<p>Function \(f\) gives the depth, in inches, of water in a tub as a function of time, \(t\), in minutes, since the tub started being drained.</p>
<p><img alt="Graph. Horizontal axis, 0 to 10, t, time, minutes. Vertical axis, 0 to 7, depth of water, inches. Line starts at 0 comma 6, decreases, passes through 2 comma 5, goes horizontal at 7 comma 2 point 5." src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/im-ims-export/Nx7zBa4WfKZfTzmEB3cs6ng8"></p>
<p>Each point on the graph has the coordinates \((t,f(t))\), where the first value is the input of the function and the second value is the output.</p>
<ul>
<li>\(f(2)\) represents the depth of water 2 minutes after the tub started being drained. The graph passes through \((2,5)\), so the depth of water is 5 inches when \(t=2\). The equation \(f(2)=5\) captures this information.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>\(f(0)\) gives the depth of the water when the draining began, at \(t=0\). The graph shows the depth of water to be 6 inches at that time, so we can write \(f(0)=6\).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>\(f(t)=3\) tells us that \(t\) minutes after the tub started draining, the depth of the water is 3 inches. The graph shows that this happens when \(t\) is 6.</li>
<li>In the graph, \(f(2)&gt;f(7)\).</li>
<li>\(f(7)=f(10)\)</li>
<li>\(f(4)&lt;f(6)\)</li>
<li>\(f(0)=6\)</li>
</ul>

<p>Function \(P\) gives the depth of the pool water after \(t\) hours of it being refilled.</p>

<p>Here is how to find meaning in the statement:</p>
<p>The statement reads &ldquo;\(P\) of 12 is less than \(P\) of 4.&rdquo; The input is the time in hours, and the output is the depth of the pool. So, the depth of the pool after 12 hours is less than it was after 4 hours.</p>
