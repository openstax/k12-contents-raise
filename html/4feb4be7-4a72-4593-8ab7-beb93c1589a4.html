<p>In this lesson, you will review proportions and proportional relationships. Understanding proportions will help you learn how to recognize direct variation situations. You will then set up direct variation equations and work to solve problems. Direct variation is seen in everyday life in a variety of proportional relationships. Examples include the amount a paycheck increases with more hours of work; the distance a car travels compared to its rate of speed; and the cost of an electric bill based on the amount of electricity used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Set up and solve direct variation problems.</li>
