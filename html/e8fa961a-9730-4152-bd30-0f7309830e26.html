The residuals seem well spaced on either side of the \(x\)-axis without an obvious pattern, and all of the residuals are close to 0.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4><h5>Points to Emphasize</h5><div>If students struggle here, select sample student work to discuss and assign practice problems to revisit this topic. Residuals will not be discussed again in this unit.</div><p><br></p></div></div></div><br><p></p>
