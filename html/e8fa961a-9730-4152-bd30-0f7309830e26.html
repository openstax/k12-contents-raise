<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Each of these graphs of residuals is from the same set of data using different lines to fit the data.
    Which graph is most likely to represent the residuals from a line of best fit? Be prepared to show your
    reasoning.</p>

      <h4>Student Response</h4>
      <p>Graph A is most likely to represent the residuals from the best fit line. The residuals seem well
          spaced on either side of the \(x\)-axis without an obvious pattern, and all of the residuals are close to
          0.</p>
      <h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
      <h5>Points to Emphasize</h5>
      <p>If students struggle here, select sample student work to discuss and assign practice problems to revisit this
        topic. Residuals will not be discussed again in this unit.</p>
