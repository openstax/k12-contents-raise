<p dir="ltr"><span>Each of these graphs of residuals is from the same set of data using different lines to fit the data. Which graph is most likely to represent the residuals from a line of best fit? Explain your reasoning.</span><br></p>

      <h4>Student Response</h4>
      <div><span>Graph A is most likely to represent the residuals from the best fit line. The residuals seem well spaced on either side of the \(x\)-axis without an obvious pattern, and all of the residuals are close to 0.</span></div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
      <h5>Points to Emphasize</h5>
      <div>If students struggle here, select sample student work to discuss and assign practice problems to revisit this topic. Residuals will not be discussed again in this unit.</div>
