<p>Display the following description and graphs for all to see.</p>
<p>Suppose Clare went back to the store to get more almonds and dried figs and spent&nbsp;$108 this time. Almonds cost&nbsp;$6 a pound, and dried figs cost&nbsp;$9 a pound. Clare&rsquo;s purchase can be represented by the equation&nbsp;\( 6x+9y=108 \).</p>
<p>Here are two graphs that represent the relationship between pounds of almonds,&nbsp;\( x \), and pounds of figs,&nbsp;\( y \).</p>

  <li>&ldquo;Without calculating anything, can you tell which graph could represent the equation&nbsp;\( 6x+9y=108 \)&nbsp;and which graph could not?&rdquo; (Yes, graph B could represent the equation. The graph of the equation would have a negative slope because the more almonds Clare bought, the fewer dried figs she could have afforded. Graph A shows that as more almonds are bought, more figs are also bought, which couldn&rsquo;t be true if Clare spent a fixed amount of money.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;What does the vertical intercept mean in this situation?&rdquo; (It shows the pounds of dried figs Clare could buy if she bought no almonds.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;What is the vertical intercept of the graph? How can we find it?&rdquo; (The vertical intercept is&nbsp;\( (0,12) \). One way to find it is to substitute 0 for&nbsp;\( x \)&nbsp;and solve for&nbsp;\( y \), which gives&nbsp;\( y=12 \). Another way is to rearrange the equation into slope-intercept form.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;What is the slope of the graph? How can we find it?&rdquo; (The slope is&nbsp;\( -\frac23 \). We can rearrange the equation into slope-intercept form, or we can find the coordinates of another point and calculate the slope.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;What does the slope tell us about the almonds and dried figs?&rdquo; (It tells us that for every additional pound of almonds that Clare buys, she could buy&nbsp;\( \frac23 \)&nbsp;fewer pound of dried figs.)</li>
