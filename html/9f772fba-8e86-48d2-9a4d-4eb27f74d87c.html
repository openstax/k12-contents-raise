<p>In this lesson, you will continue to learn that some solutions to quadratic equations are irrational and can also include expressions that involve a rational number and an irrational number.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Use the radical and "plus-minus" symbols to represent solutions to quadratic equations. </li>
  <li> Explain why the plus-minus symbol is used when solving quadratic equations by finding square roots. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
