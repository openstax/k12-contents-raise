<p><strong>Part 1:</strong> Writing Inequalities in Two Variables Given A Set of Data in a Table</p>
<p>Write a linear inequality in two variables based on the given data:</p>
<table class="os-raise-skinnytable">
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col">\(x\)</th>
<th scope="col">\(y\)</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>-4</td>
<td>-3</td>

<tr>
<td>-2</td>
<td>-2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>-1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br/>
<p>Remember that for an inequality the points could be on the line, above the the line, or below the line.  The type of inequality will differ based on these conditions.</p>
<table class="os-raise-horizontaltable">
<thead>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th scope="row">On the line</th>
<td> \(\leq\) or \(\geq\) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">Above the line</th>
<td>\(\gt\)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">Below the line</th>
<td>\(\lt\)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br/>
<p>If you are given a set of possible points like the table above, there could be multiple lines that the data points could represent.  Let’s figure out a few possibilities for this given set.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> Graph the points on a coordinate plane.</p>
<p><img alt="A coordinate plane with five labeled points: (5, 8), (3, 5), (1, 1), (3, -5), and (-4, -6). Each point is marked with a green dot and labeled with its coordinates." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b68cb27bb14fbe6ed09f6a4b71d795de41b1ebf7"/></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Determine possible lines.</p>
<p>Remember that the dots can be on the line, but they all have to be either above or below to create an inequality.  If the line has points on both sides, then the line isn’t a possibility.</p>
<p>Let’s try a few possibilities. We can start with the equation \(y=x\) to see if the points are above the line or below the line.</p>
<p><img alt="A graph of a red line that has a positive slope passes through points (0,0) and (1, 1). Additional green points are at (3,5), (5, 8), (negative 4, negative 6) and (3, negative 5). All points are labeled with their coordinates." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/60b97dc16d33f7b3edfcf5efbb96256bfadd96a7"/></p>
<p>The equation \(y=x\) cannot be a possibility because there are points above and below the line.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 -</strong> Adjust the slope or \(y\)-intercept</p>
<p>We can change the slope and the y-intercept to see how we can shift the line to be able to capture all the points. Let’s move the line to below the \((3, -5)\) and \((-4, -6)\).  We can leave the slope as 1 and change the y-intercept to -7.</p>
<p><img alt="A graph of a red line with positive slope passing through it. Labeled points are at (3, 5), (5, 8), (1, 1), (-4, -6), and (3, -5) marked with green dots. the line does not intersect any of the labeled points." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/e710802ff3c9d7b912f10604c9c314a8719c3a60" width="300"/></p>
<p>There is still one point below the line.  We could decrease the slope of the line to \(m=13\). </p>
<p><img alt="A graph showing five green points labeled (3, 5), (5, 8), (1, 1), (3, -5), and (-4, -6), with a red line that has a positive slope. The line does not intersect any of the labeled points." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/cfcb49dc42e98e04d4fd1a580dfed336c09536d0" width="300"/></p>
<p>Now all of the points are above the line.  This means that the value of \(y\) is always greater than the \(x\) value.</p>
<p>So, one of the possible solutions could be \(y&gt; 13x-7\).</p>
<br/>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold"><strong>Part 2:</strong> Using Tables to Solve Inequalities in Two Variables</p>
<p>Graph the linear inequality \(y &lt; \frac{1}{2}x − 1\) using a table.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Create a table of values using the related equation \(y = \frac{1}{2}x − 1\) to identify points on the boundary line of the inequality.</p>
<table class="os-raise-skinnytable">
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col">\(x\)</th>
<th scope="col">\(y\)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>−4</td>
<td>−3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>−2</td>
<td>−2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>-1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br/>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Plot the points and sketch the boundary line.</p>
<p>If the inequality is \(\leq\) or \(\geq\), the boundary line is solid.</p>
<p>If the inequality is \(&lt;\) or \(&gt;\), the boundary line is dashed.</p>
<p>The inequality sign is \(&lt;\), so we draw a dashed line.</p>
<p><img alt="A graph with a dashed teal line passing through points (-4, -3), (-2, -2), (0, -1), (2, 0), and (4, 1) on a grid. The line has a positive slope and crosses the y-axis at -1." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/58a574ba91345f694a3db3762d2bc5ee16c86792" width="300"/></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Test a point that is not on the boundary line. Is it a solution of the inequality?</p>
<p>Test \((0, 0)\) as it is not on the boundary line of the inequality.</p>
<p>\(y \overset?&lt; \frac{1}{2} x − 1\)</p>
<p>\((0) &lt; \frac{1}{2}(0) − 1\)</p>
<p>\(0 &lt; − 1\) is False.</p>
<p>So, \((0, 0)\) is not a solution.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Shade in one side of the boundary line.</p>
<p>If the test point is a solution, shade in the side that includes the point.</p>
<p>If the test point is not a solution, shade in the opposite side.</p>
<p>The test point \((0, 0)\) is not a solution, so shade in the side of the boundary line that does not include \((0, 0)\).</p>
<p><img alt="A graph with a shaded region below the dashed line representing y equals one-half times x minus 1." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/35b11285cf8c33fdf425e2dca7b9b7bf7c9afeca" width="300"/></p>
<p>All points in the shaded region and not on the boundary line represent the solutions to \(y &lt; \frac{1}{2} x − 1\).</p>

<p>Here’s how to solve an inequality using a table:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Create a table of values using the related equation \(y = 2x + 3\) to identify points on the boundary line of the inequality.</p>
<table class="os-raise-skinnytable">

<br/>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Plot the points and sketch the boundary line.</p>
<p>If the inequality is \(\leq\) or \(\geq\), the boundary line is solid.</p>
<p>If the inequality is \(&lt;\) or \(&gt;\), the boundary line is dashed.</p>
<p>The inequality sign is , so we draw a solid line.</p>
<p><img alt="A graph with a dashed teal line passing through points (-4, -5), (-2, -1), (0, 3), and (2, 7) on a grid. The line has a positive slope and crosses the y-axis at 3." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/341d1376d80f11af33d4dedb611828816f5d0fb9" width="300"/></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Test a point that is not on the boundary line. Is it a solution of the inequality?</p>
<p>Test \((0, 0)\) as it is not on the boundary line of the inequality.</p>
<p>\(y  \leq 2x + 3\)</p>
<p>\((0)  \stackrel {?}{\leq} 2(0) + 3\)</p>
<p>\(0  \leq 3\) is True.</p>
<p>So, (0, 0) is a solution.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Shade in one side of the boundary line.</p>
<p>If the test point is a solution, shade in the side that includes the point.</p>
<p>If the test point is not a solution, shade in the opposite side.</p>
<p>The test point \((0, 0)\) is a solution, so shade in the side of the boundary line that includes \((0, 0)\).</p>
<p><img alt="A graph with a shaded region below the dashed line representing y equals two times x plus 3." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/37fe97b84f8a51f20da54c56d324e29532ed6e40" width="300"/></p>
<p>All points in the shaded region and not on the boundary line represent the solutions to \(y  \leq 2x + 3\).</p>
