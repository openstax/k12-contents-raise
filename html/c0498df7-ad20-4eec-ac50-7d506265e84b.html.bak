<p>Here are three patterns of dots.</p>
<p>Pattern A</p>
<p><img alt="A pattern of dots. Step 0 has no dots. Step 1 has a column of 2 dots. Step 2 has two columns of 2 dots. Step 3 has three columns of 2 dots." height="96" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/194e1b67c3ffd41194a6988591af6534b3030885" width="365"/></p>
<p>Pattern B</p>
<p><img alt="A pattern of dots. Step 0 has 1 dot. Step 1 has a row of 2 dots. Step 2 has 2 rows of dots. In the bottom row are 3 dots and in the top row are 2 dots. The top row is arranged so the upper left space of row 2 is left open. Step 3 has 3 rows of dots. The bottom row has 4 dots. Row 2 has 3 dots and row 3 has 3 dots." height="110" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/195f89d68ad7960983a0a610fb34162825a1ef6e" width="365"/></p>
<p>Pattern C</p>
<p><img alt="A pattern of dots. Step 0 has 1 dot. Step 1 has a row of 3 dots. Step 2 has 3 rows of 3 dots. Step 3 has 3 rows of 9 dots." height="110" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c5b538a1b4584d059bc5042f1366aa61bd9ba29b" width="461"/></p>

<p>Compare your answer:</p>
<p>Pattern B shows a quadratic relationship.Â </p>
<ul>
<li> The number of dots is the step number squared plus 1, or \(n^2+1\). </li>
<li> Pattern A is growing linearly. It is growing by 2 each time. Pattern C is growing by a factor of 3 each time, so it is growing exponentially. </li>
<li> Pattern B is growing by 1, then by 3, and then by 5, which is the pattern we saw in other examples of quadratic relationships in the lesson. </li>
</ul>
