<p>To help students synthesize their work in the lesson, consider asking them to write a response to one or both of the following prompts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We could use numbers or letters to represent the quantities in a situation. When might it make sense to use only numbers? When might it make sense to use letters?</li>
    <li>You&rsquo;ve heard the phrases &ldquo;a quantity that varies&rdquo; and &ldquo;a quantity that stays constant&rdquo; in this lesson. Describe what they mean in your own words. If possible, give an example of a situation that has a quantity that varies and a quantity that stays constant.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
