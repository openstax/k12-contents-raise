      <p><span>To help students synthesize their work in the lesson, consider asking them to write a response to one or both of the following prompts:</span></p>
      <div class="body">
        <ul>
          <li>We could use numbers or letters to represent the quantities in a situation. When might it make sense to use only numbers? When might it make sense to use letters?</li>
          <li>You&rsquo;ve heard the phrases &ldquo;a quantity that varies&rdquo; and &ldquo;a quantity that stays constant&rdquo; in this lesson. Describe what they mean in your own words. If possible, give an example of a situation that has a quantity that varies and a quantity that stays constant.</li>
