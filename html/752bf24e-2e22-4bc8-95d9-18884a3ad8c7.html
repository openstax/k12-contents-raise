<h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>
<p>In a previous lesson, students solved systems of linear equations by graphing. Here, they transition to solving systems algebraically&ndash;by substitution&ndash;and to reasoning about systems without context.</p>

<p>The lesson activates and builds on what students have learned in grade 8 about solving by substitution. Students see that a system can be solved by replacing a variable with a number or with an expression and that various substitutions can be done to solve the same system. They also begin to build an awareness of the kinds of systems that are conducive to being solved by substitution.<p>

<p>Students practice looking for and making use of structure as they identify the variables or expressions to substitute and ways to perform substitutions efficiently.</p>

<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Recognize that a system can be efficiently solved by substitution if one variable is already isolated or can easily be isolated.</li>
  <li>Recognize that there are multiple ways to perform substitution to solve a system of equations.</li>
  <li>Solve systems of linear equations by substituting a variable with a number or an expression and check solutions by substituting them back into the equations.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Solve systems of equations by substituting a variable or an expression.</li>
  <li>Identify more than one way to perform substitution and decide how to substitute based on how the given equations are written.</li>
</ul>

    <h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
    <p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are
  only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.
