<p>In this lesson, you will use your skills finding common factors in different terms to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of two or more expressions. You will then use the GCF to factor these expressions. In some cases, you will need to group terms together so that the expressions can be factored. These skills will allow you to rewrite expressions into a simpler, fully factored form.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Find the greatest common factor of two or more expressions. </li>
  <li> Factor the greatest common factor from a polynomial. </li>
  <li> Factor by grouping. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the<strong> activities </strong>that will help you reach those goals:</p>
