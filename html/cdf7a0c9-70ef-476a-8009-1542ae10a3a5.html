<h3>Activity (10 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity allows students to formulate a mathematical model around the framing task they saw earlier. Students are prompted to write an equation but are not expected to solve it at this point.</p>
<p>The prompt to write an equation is left relatively open to allow for different approaches. For instance, students may think in terms of:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> The length and width of the framed picture. The length is 7 inches plus the width of the frame, \(x\), on either side, which gives \(7 + 2x\). The height is 4 inches plus the same frame width, \(x\), for the top and bottom, which gives \(4 + 2x\). The total area is \(7 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot (2.5)\), or 38 square inches, so the equation is \((7 + 2x)(4 + 2x) = 38\). </li>
<li> The area of the picture plus the area of the frame. The area of the picture is 28 square inches. The area of the frame, in square inches, can be found by decomposing it into </li>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> four squares (in the corners) that are \(x\) by \(x\), or \(x^2\) each </li>
<li> two rectangles that are \(7x\) each (top and bottom) </li>
<li> two rectangles that are \(4x\) each (left and right). </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The equation is \(4x^2+2(7x)+2(4x)+28=38\) or \(4x^2+22x+28=38\).</p>
<p>As students work, monitor for different strategies students use. Invite students with contrasting approaches to share later.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Tell students that they will now write an equation to represent the quantities in the framing problem. Consider arranging students in groups of two and asking them to think quietly about the questions before conferring with their partner.</p>
<p>If students have trouble getting started, suggest that they start by labeling the diagram with relevant lengths. Then, if needed, use scaffolding questions such as:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> "How do you determine the area of a picture that is 7 inches by 4 inches?" (Multiply \(7 \cdot 4 = 28\).) </li>
<li>"What is the combined area of the picture and the framing material?" (38 square inches, because \(7 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot (2.5) = 38\).) </li>
<li> "What happens to the dimensions of a picture if a frame is added around the outside of the picture?" (It increases.) </li>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> "How is the width changed?" (It will be increased by two times the width of the frame.) </li>
<li> "How is the length changed?" (It will be increased by two times the width of the frame.) </li>
</ul>
<li>"How could we show that the frame is the same width all the way around?" (Use the same variable, for example, \(x\), to label the width of the strip of framing on all four sides.) </li>
</ul>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here is a diagram that shows the picture with a frame that is the same width all the way around.</p>
<p>The picture is 7 inches by 4 inches. The frame is created from 10 square inches of framing material (in the form of a rectangle measuring 4 inches by 2.5 inches).</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
<li>What would a solution to this equation mean in this situation?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> A solution would represent the width of the frame when all of the framing material is used.</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may struggle to express the overall length and width of the framed picture because of trouble combining numbers and variables. Consider drawing a segment composed of 3 pieces of length 1.5 inches, 10 inches, and 1.5 inches, and prompting students to find the length of the entire segment. Then, change each 1.5 to an \(x\) and ask for an expression for the length of the entire segment \((10 + 2x)\).</p>
<p>If students mistake the result of adding \(x\) and \(x\) as \(x^2\), consider drawing a square with side length \(x\) and ask students to write expressions for the perimeter and area. Then, ask them to point out the difference between multiplying to find area and adding to find total length. If needed, draw a few more segments that are decomposed into parts, with each part labeled with a number or a variable expression, and ask students to write expressions for the total length.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students to present their equations and reasoning. If no students bring up one of the strategies shown in the Activity Narrative, bring it up. Consider asking students whether \((7 + 2x)(4 + 2x) = 38\) and \(4x^2 + 22x + 28 = 38\) (or other correct equations that come up) are equivalent and how to check if they are.</p>
<p>Discuss what a solution to these equations represents. Make sure students understand that a solution reveals the width of the frame when all of the framing material (10 square inches) is used.</p>
<p>Solicit some ideas on how they might go about finding the solution(s). Students may mention:</p>
<ul>
<li> Graphing the equation \(y = (7 + 2x)(4 + 2x)\) and finding a point on the graph with a \(y\)-coordinate of 38 </li>
<li> Evaluating the expression on one side of the equation at different values of \(x\) until it has a value of 38 </li>
<li> Using a spreadsheet to evaluate the expression at different values of \(x\) and see what values produce an output of 38 </li>
</ul>
<p>We can see that the equations \((7 + 2x)(4 + 2x) = 38\) and \(4x^2 + 22x + 28 = 38\) are each composed of a quadratic expression. Tell students that these are examples of quadratic equations.</p>
<p>A quadratic equation is defined as one that can be written in the form of \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where \(a\) is not 0.</p>
<p>They will learn several techniques for using algebra to solve equations like this. In the next lesson, students will work with equations of this form and make sense of them in context.</p>

<p>\(4x^2 + 20x + 25 = 36\)</p>

<p>That's correct! Check yourself: The length of one side of the frame is \(2x + 5\). The area of the framed picture is \((2x + 5)(2x + 5)\). Set this equal to the total area, \(25 + 11\), or 36 square inches. So, the equation to represent the total area is \((2x + 5)(2x + 5) = 36\), or \(4x^2 + 20x + 25 = 36\).</p>

<p>Incorrect. Let's try again a different way: The length of one side of the frame is \(2x + 5\). So the area of the framed picture is \((2x + 5)(2x + 5)\). Remember to add the product of the inner terms and outer terms when multiplying the binomials. Set this equal to the total area, \(25 + 11\), or 36 square inches. The answer, or the equation to represent the total area, is \((2x + 5)(2x + 5) = 36\), or \(4x^2 + 20x + 25 = 36\).</p>

<h4>Formulating a Quadratic Equation to Represent the Model</h4>
<p>Let's look at a similar situation as in the previous activities but using a picture with different measurements.</p>
<p>Imagine a picture 8 inches by 6 inches. The frame is created from 32 square inches of framing material. The frame will be uniform in width, and all of the framing material is used.</p>
<p>How do we write an equation representing the total area of the framed picture?</p>
<p><img alt="A FRAMED PICTURE." height="232" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/bf047a5f6cfa1e2bcecc83d87d38dfcd8692117f" width="300"></p>
<p>Let's break down the measurements that we know.</p>
<p>Let \(x\) represent the thickness of the frame in inches.</p>
<p><img alt="A rectangular picture has side lengths measuring 8 inches by 6 inches. It is surrounded by a frame that is uniformly x inches in width." height="317" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/dceee0cd555cd3e8fcb6de7750d4a66c50dbda52" width="350"></p>
<p>Since the picture is 8 inches by 6 inches, it has an area of 48 square inches.</p>
<p>The frame is created from 32 square inches of framing material, and we must use all of it. So, the total area of the framed picture is \(48 + 32\), or 80 square inches.</p>
<p>The length of one side of the framed picture is \(x + 6 + x = 2x + 6\).</p>
<p><img alt="A DIAGRAM REPRESENTING A RECTANGULAR PICTURE INSIDE A RECTANGULAR PICTURE FRAME IS SHOWN. THE RECTANGULAR PICTURE FRAME HAS A SIDE LENGTH OF 6 INCHES AND X AND X LABELED." height="232" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/03fd8be04c40854d0d85e8ca821618315df14678" width="350"></p>
<p>The length of the other side of the framed picture is \(x + 8 + x = 2x + 8\).</p>
<p><img alt="A DIAGRAM REPRESENTING A RECTANGULAR PICTURE INSIDE A RECTANGULAR PICTURE FRAME IS SHOWN. THE RECTANGULAR PICTURE FRAME HAS A SIDE LENGTH OF 8 INCHES AND X AND X LABELED." height="291" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c0de4d3970e836136536fbfcd0fbc25e4fcb56f9" width="300"></p>
<p>So, the area of the framed picture is \((2x + 8)(2x + 6)\). We can set this equal to 80 square inches.</p>
<p>\((2x + 8)(2x + 6) = 80\)</p>
<p>Let's multiply.</p>
<p>\(4x^2 + 12x + 16x + 48 = 80\)</p>
<p>\(4x^2 + 28x + 48 = 80\)</p>
<p>So, the equation representing the total area of the framed picture is \(4x^2 + 28x + 48 = 80\).</p>
<p>This equation is a quadratic equation. A quadratic equation is defined as one that can be written in the form of \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) where \(a\) is not 0.</p>
<h4>Try It: Formulating a Quadratic Equation to Represent the Model</h4>
<p>A picture measures 9 inches by 7 inches. Its frame is created from 36 square inches of framing material. The frame will be uniform in width, and all of the framing material is used.</p>
<p>Write an equation representing the total area of the framed picture.</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to find the quadratic equation to represent the total area of the framed picture:</p>
<p>The area of the picture is 63 square inches. The total area of the framed picture will be \(63 + 36\), or 99 square inches.</p>
<p>The sides of the framed picture are represented by \((2x + 9)\) and \((2x + 7)\).</p>
<p>So, the total area of the framed picture is represented by \(4x^2 + 32x + 63 = 99\).</p>
