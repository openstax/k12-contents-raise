<h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>
<p>In this culminating project, students integrate ideas from the unit. In the first activity, students analyze points on a graph to identify their meaning in context. In the second activity, students identify slopes and intercepts from graphs and match equations to graphs. Finally, students create their own scenarios to match a linear equation.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h3>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Analyze the relationship among linear equations, graphs, and verbal descriptions.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>

    Identify slopes and intercepts from a graph.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Identify an equation that matches a graph.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Create a real-world scenario from a graph.

  </li>
</ul>
