<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>Here is the quadratic formula:</p>
<p>\(x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2- 4ac}}{2a}\)</p>
<p>Use the formula to solve the equation \(x^2+9x+8=0\).</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The solutions are -8 and -1.</p>
<p>Apply the quadratic formula for \(a=1\), \(b=9\), \(c=8\):</p>
<p>\(x=\frac{-9 \pm \sqrt{(9)^2- 4(1)(8)}}{2(1)}=\frac{-9 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2}\), which means</p>
<p>\(x=\frac{-9-7}{2}=-8\) and \(x=\frac{-9+7}{2}=-1\).</p>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
