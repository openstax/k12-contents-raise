<h4>Evaluating Functions with Function Notation</h4>
<p><strong>Find the Value of a Function</strong><br>
  It is very convenient to name a function, and most often we name it \(f\), \(g\), or \(h\). In any function, for each \(x\)-value from the domain we get a corresponding \(y\)-value in the range. For the function \(f\), we write this range value \(y\) as \(f(x)\). This is called function notation, and is read \(f\) of \(x\) or the value of \(f\) at \(x\). In this case, the parentheses do not indicate multiplication.</p>
<h5>Function Notation</h5>
<p>For the function \(y=f(x)\):</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(f\) is the name of the function.
  </li>
  <li>
    \(x\) is the input value.</li>
  <li>\(f(x)\) is the output value, \(y\), corresponding to the value of \(x\).</li>
</ul>
<p>We read \(f(x)\) as \(f\) of \(x\) or the value of \(f\) at \(x\).</p>
<p>We call \(x\) the independent variable as it can be any value in the domain. We call \(y\) the dependent variable as its value depends on \(x\).</p>
<h5>Independent and Dependent Variables</h5>
<p>For the function \(y=f(x)\),</p>
<p>\(x\) is the independent variable as it can be any value.</p>
<p>\(y\) is the dependent variable as its value depends on \(x\).</p>
<p>Much as when you first encountered the variable \(x\), function notation may be rather unsettling. It seems strange because it is new. You will feel more comfortable with the notation as you use it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the equation \(y=4x-5\). To find the value of \(y\) when \(x=2\), we know to substitute \(x=2\) into the equation and then simplify.</p>

<p>The value of the function at \(x=2\) is 3.</p>
<p>We can do the same thing using function notation. The equation \(y=4x-5\) can be written as \(f(x)=4x-5\). To find the value when \(x=2\), we write:</p>

    <tr>
      <td>

      </td>
      <td>
        <p>\(f(x)=4x&minus;5\)</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p>Substitute \(x=2\) in for \(x\).</p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>\(f(2)=4(2)-5\)</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p>Simplify.</p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>\(f(2)=3\)</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<p>The value of the function at \(x=2\) is 3.</p>
<p>This process of finding the value of \(f(x)\) for a given value of \(x\) is called evaluating the function.</p>
