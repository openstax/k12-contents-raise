<h3>Narrative</h3>
<p>In this lesson, you will use the main function types you have studied thus far in the course (linear and exponential) to model different populations. In the first activity, data for three city populations will be given and you will be asked to produce a linear or exponential model for each (if appropriate) and then make predictions for populations at other dates. 
</p>
<p>In the second activity, you will examine the world population. The task is more open-ended and only limited data is provided, likely requiring you to gather more data. 
</p>
<p>Throughout the project, you will engage in different parts of the modeling cycle. Be careful - you will have to think carefully about how to choose an appropriate linear or exponential model.
