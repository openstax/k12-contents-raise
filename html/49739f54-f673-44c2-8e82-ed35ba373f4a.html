<h4>Finding the GCF of Two or More Expressions</h4>
<p>Earlier, we multiplied factors together to get a product. Now, we will reverse this process; we will start with a product and then break it down into its factors. Splitting a product into factors is called <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="storename">factoring</span>.</p>

<p>Now we will factor expressions and find the <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="storename">greatest common factor</span> of two or more expressions.</p>

  <p> <strong> GREATEST COMMON FACTOR </strong> </p>
  <hr>
  <p>The greatest common factor (GCF) of two or more expressions is the largest expression that is a factor of all the expressions.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>We will summarize the steps we use to find the greatest common factor.</p>
<p><strong>How to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of two expressions:</strong></p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Factor each coefficient into primes. Write all variables with exponents in expanded form.</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  List all factors, matching common factors in a column. In each column, circle the common factors.</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Bring down the common factors that all expressions share.</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  Multiply the factors.</p>
<p>The following example will show the steps to find the greatest common factor of three expressions.</p>
<strong>
  <p>EXAMPLE</p>
</strong>
<p>Find the greatest common factor of \(21x^3, 9x^2, 15x\).</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Factor each coefficient into primes and write the variables with exponents in expanded form.</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Circle the common factors in each column.</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Bring down the common factors. </p>

<p>Step 4<br>
  Multiply the factors.<br>
  GFC = \(3x\)</p>
<p>The GCF of \(21x^3\), \(9x^2\), and \(15x\) is \(3x\).</p>
