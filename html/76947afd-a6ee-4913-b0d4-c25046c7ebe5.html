<p dir="ltr">Farms To Grow founders Gordon Reed and Gail Myers work with Black farmers and other underserved farmers to
  help them keep their farms operational. Statistical models can help the farmers they work with make decisions about
  how to sustain their farms. These farmers can use statistics to decide the amount of crops to grow to make a profit.
  They can use statistics relating to weather, climate, and rainfall.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a previous course, you used statistics to investigate patterns of association in numerical data in two
  variables. In this section, you will learn how a linear model is used to describe the relationship between two
  variables. You will use scatter plots and lines of best fit to visualize numerical data in two variables. Technology
  will be used to compute the lines of best fit and to observe how well the linear models match the data. Residuals will
  be used to quantify the goodness of fit of the linear model.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This section includes 3 lessons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Linear Models</li>
  <li>Fitting Lines</li>
  <li>Residuals</li>
</ul>
<p>This lesson represents an extension from the TEKS listed and can be used as an enrichment to enhance the students&rsquo;
  understanding of "linear functions that provide a reasonable fit to data" (A4.C).</p>
<p>This Section Overview Video provides a closer look at the individual lessons within this section, and provides
  teachers with pacing and instructional suggestions for successful classroom implementation. </p>
