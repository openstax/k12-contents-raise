<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Rearrange a quadratic equation to be written as <em>expression in factored form&nbsp;</em>\(=0\) and find the solutions. </li>
  <li> Recognize quadratic equations that have zero, one, or two solutions when they are written in factored form. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 8.9.1: Finding a Solution through Substitution </li>
  <ul class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li> In this activity, you tried to find the solution to a quadratic equation by guessing and checking. You substituted a value in for \(x\) to determine whether the equation was true. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 8.9.2: Using Factored Form and the Zero Product Property to Solve Quadratic Equations </li>
  <ul class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li> In this activity, you practiced setting an equation equal to 0 before finding its factored form. Then you used the zero product property on the factored form to solve the quadratic equation. </li>
    <li> 8.9.2: Self Check </li>
    <li> 8.9.2: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 8.9.3: Writing an Equation to Represent a Quadratic Function with Only One Solution </li>
  <ul class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li> In this activity, you learned the relationship between the number of solutions found in the factored form of a quadratic function and the number of zeros on the graph of the same quadratic function. You used this relationship to make predictions about the quadratic function. </li>
    <li> 8.9.3: Self Check </li>
    <li> 8.9.3: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 8.9.4: Solving More Quadratic Equations </li>
  <ul class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li> In this activity, you continued to practice solving quadratic equations as you became more familiar with their factored form and the zero product property. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
