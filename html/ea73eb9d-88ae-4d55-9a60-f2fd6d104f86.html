<p>In this lesson, you will study exponential functions and their graphs in context. Given a graph or a description of a relationship, you write one quantity as a function of another and then use the function to answer questions about the context. You will also produce graphs of exponential functions, paying close attention to the appropriate domain and range.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Analyze a situation and determine whether it makes sense to connect the points on the graph that represents the situation. </li>
<li> Describe the relationship in a graph of an exponential function using function notation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the<strong> activities </strong>that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li> 5.9.1: Evaluating Expressions for Different Values of \(x\)</li>
<li> 5.9.2: Analyze Underlying Relationship in a Graph of a Function&nbsp;
    <ul>
<li> 5.9.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li> 5.9.4: Deciding on Graphing Window&nbsp; </li>
<li> 5.9.5: Interpret Graphs to Find Approximate Values </li>
</ul>
<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>
