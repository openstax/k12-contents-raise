<p>Arthur Noriega has to understand and make sense of the relationships among quantities when planning the budget for new construction and for maintenance of buildings and structures within the city. He can use equations to model relationships to help compare and make sense of the quantities.</p>
<p>In previous lessons, you studied slopes of lines and writing equations given certain information. In previous courses, you studied parallel lines. In this section, you will connect these ideas and learn about the relationship between slopes of parallel and perpendicular lines. You will use the relationship to write equations of lines that are parallel and perpendicular to a given line. You will complete the unit using what you know about proportional relationships to write and solve equations involving direct variation.</p>
<p>This section includes 3 lessons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Writing the Equation of a Line</li>
  <li>Writing Equations of Parallel and Perpendicular Lines</li>
  <li>Direct Variation</li>
</ul>
<p>This Section Overview Video provides a closer look at the individual lessons within this section, and provides teachers with pacing and instructional suggestions for successful classroom implementation. </p>
