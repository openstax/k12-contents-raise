<h4>Writing Inequalities to Represent Constraints</h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span><strong>Example</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Elena needs to earn at least $450 a week during her summer break to pay for college. She works two jobs. One as a swimming instructor that pays $9 an hour and the other as an intern in a genetics lab for $22.50 per hour. How many hours does Elena need to work at each job to earn at least $450 per week?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let x be the number of hours she works teaching swimming and let y be the number of hours she works as an intern.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Write an inequality that would model this situation.</p>
<p>She earns $9 per hour at the job as a swimming instructor and $22.50 in the genetics lab. At each job the number of hours multiplied by the hourly wage will give the amount earned at that job.</p>

<h4>Try It: Writing Inequalities to Represent Constraints</h4>
<p>A baker sells pies and cakes at the bakery. Each pie sells for $14 and each cake sells for $23. Between all the sales, the baker wants to earn at least $525. How many pies and cakes does the baker need to sell to meet their goal?</p>
