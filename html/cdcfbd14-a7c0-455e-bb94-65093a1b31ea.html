<p>In this lesson, we learned the terms <em>growth factor</em> and <em>constant ratio</em> and used equations and graphs to represent situations with quantities that change exponentially. Ask students to identify the connections between the quantities in a situation and the graph and expressions that represent it. Use an example from a classroom activity or a new example like this:</p>
<p>\(1000\cdot 2^t\) represents a fish population after \(t\) years. Here is the graph of the yearly fish population. Display for all to see, and ask students where they can see the 1,000 and the 2 in the graph.</p>

<ul>
<li> What was the fish population when the scientists first measured it? (1,000) </li>
<li> How can you tell from the graph? (It is the vertical intercept, the number of fish when \(t=0\).) </li>
<li> How is the fish population changing from year to year? (It&rsquo;s doubling.) </li>
<li> How does the expression \(1000\cdot 2^t\) represent the fish population after \(t\) years? (The 1,000 is the starting population. Every year it doubles, so we multiply 1,000 by 2, \(t\) times.) </li>
