<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Calculate the average rate of change of a function over a specified period of time. </li>
<li> Recognize how the average rate of change of an exponential function differs from that of a linear function. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li> 5.10.1: Calculate an Average Rate of Change from Two Points </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you recalled how to calculate an average rate of change from two points. </li>
</ul>
<li> 5.10.2: Explore Average Rates of Change in an Exponential Growth Function </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you began exploring average rates of change in an exponential growth function. In particular, the focus for this activity was on how exponential functions have different rates of change for different input intervals, which is not the case for linear functions. </li>

<ul>
</ul>
<li> 5.10.3: Explore Average Rates of Change in an Exponential Decay Context </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you continued to explore average rates of change for exponential functions. This time, you focused on a previously encountered exponential decay context. </li>
</ul>
<li><span>5.10.3: Self Ch</span><span>eck</span><br></li>
<ul>
</ul>
<li> 5.10.4: Average Rate of Change </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you found the average rate of change and explored how well the average rate of change describes how something changes over time. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
