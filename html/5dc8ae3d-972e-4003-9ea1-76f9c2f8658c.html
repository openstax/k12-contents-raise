<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>The purpose of this warm-up is to elicit the idea that points on the graph of the equation are solutions to the equation, which will be useful when students explore graphs of linear inequalities in their Algebra 1 class. While students may notice and wonder many things about these images, the marked points above, below, and on the graph of the equation are the important discussion points.</p>
<p>Through articulating things they notice and things they wonder about the graph, students have an opportunity to attend to precision in the language they use to describe what they see. They might first propose less formal or imprecise language, and then restate their observation with more precise language to communicate more clearly.</p>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<p>Tell students that their job is to think of at least one thing they notice and at least one thing they wonder. Display the image for all to see. Give students 1 minute of quiet think time and then 1 minute to discuss the things they notice with their partner, followed by a whole-class discussion.</p>
<h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>
<p>What do you notice? What do you wonder?</p><img alt="coordinate plane" class="atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="520" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/24183d1534b12d03a2705b2ac3daa961322851e1" width="801"><br><br>
<h3>Student Response</h3>
<p>Things students might notice:
<br>
</p><ul>
<li>The point (5,10) is on the line.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The point (9,16) is not on the line.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The point (1,14) is not on the line.&nbsp;</li>
<li>There are three points plotted.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The line is decreasing.
    </li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>Things students might wonder:
<br>
</p><ul>
<li>What situation is this graph describing?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Why are some of the points off the line?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Why would someone need 18 pounds of sugar?



    </li>
</ul><p></p><br>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>Ask students to share the things they noticed and wondered. Record and display their responses for all to see. If possible, record the relevant reasoning on or near the image. After all responses have been recorded without commentary or editing, ask students, &ldquo;Is there anything on this list that you are wondering about?&rdquo; Encourage students to respectfully disagree, ask for clarification, or point out contradicting information. If the points on, above, and below the line do not come up during the conversation, ask students to discuss this idea. Ask students to describe those points in terms of the graph (e.g., above, on, or below the line; or to the left, on, and to the right of the line) as well as in terms of the context (more or less sugar for the same amount of flour).</p>
