<p>The Ensemble Theatre in Houston, Texas, uses quadratic equations to calculate ticket prices so they can make the highest possible profit on each performance. To work with quadratic equations, it is important to be able to convert them into different forms and use different strategies for solving equations.</p>
<p>As you move through this section, you will explore perfect square trinomials and work to create perfect square trinomials through completing the square in expressions. You will then work to complete the square to solve quadratic equations and also examine other methods to prove your answer is correct including using graphs. In the final lesson, you will work to solve quadratic equations that have irrational solutions.</p>
<p>This section includes five lessons:</p>
