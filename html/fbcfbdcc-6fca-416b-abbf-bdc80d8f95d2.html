<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Compare growth patterns using calculations and graphs. </li>
<li> Use words and expressions to describe patterns in tables of values.</li>
<li> Write expressions and create tables of values to represent them using descriptions of linear and exponential relationships. </li>
<li> Begin making connections between linear and exponential growth and the real world (especially financially). </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the<strong> activities </strong>that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li> 5.3.1: Creating a Pictorial Representation of Exponential Growth </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you create a pictorial representation of exponential growth. </li>
</ul>
<li> 5.3.2: Exploring Different Growth Patterns </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you explored two growth patterns and learned that a doubling pattern eventually grows very, very large, even with a small starting value. </li>
</ul>
<li><span>5.3.2: Self Check</span><br></li>
<ul>
</ul>
<li> 5.3.3: Compare and Contrast Two Patterns </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you compared and contrasted the two patterns visually. You did this by making sense of the provided graphs and used them to answer questions in the context of the scenario. You recalled that a quantity that grows by adding the same amount at each step forms a line when plotted. Also, after viewing an example, you learned that a quantity that grows by the same ratio or factor at each step forms a curve when plotted. </li>
</ul>
<li><span>5.3.3: Self Check</span><br></li>
<ul>
</ul>
<li> 5.3.4: Match Expressions and Tables with Situations </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you studied two stories characterized by different growth patterns and then matched expressions and tables with the two situations. </li>
</ul>
<li><span>5.3.4: Self Check</span><br></li>
<ul>
</ul>
<li> 5.3.5: Describe Mathematically Changes in Growth </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you described mathematically, as precisely as you could, how a population changed over time. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following<strong> practice</strong>:</p>

<li> 5.3.6: Practice </li>
