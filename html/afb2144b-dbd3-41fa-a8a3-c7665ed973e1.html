<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>For questions 1â€“4, use the following scenario to write, graph, and find solutions to inequalities.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A band is playing at an auditorium with floor seats and balcony seats. The band wants to sell the floor tickets for&nbsp;$15 each and balcony tickets for&nbsp;$12 each. They want to make at least $3,000 in ticket sales.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>How much money will they collect for selling&nbsp;\( x \)&nbsp;floor tickets?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( 15x \)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>How much money will they collect for selling&nbsp;\( y \)&nbsp;balcony tickets?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( 12y \)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Write an inequality whose solutions are the number of floor and balcony tickets sold if they make at least $3,000 in ticket sales.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( 15x+12y \geq 3,\!000 \)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>Use the graphing tool or technology outside the course. Graph the inequality that represents this scenario using the Desmos tool below</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
<p><img alt="Graph of inequality. Horizontal axis, x, from 0 to 275 by 25s. Vertical axis, y, from 0 to 275 by 25s. Line from 250 on vertical axis to 200 on horizontal axis.
