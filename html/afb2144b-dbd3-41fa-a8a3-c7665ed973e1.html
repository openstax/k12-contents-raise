<h3>Student Facing Statement</h3>
<div>
  <p>A band is playing at an auditorium with floor seats and balcony seats. The band wants to sell the floor tickets for&nbsp;<span>$</span>15 each and balcony tickets for&nbsp;<span>$</span>12 each. They want to make at least $3,000 in ticket sales.</p><span>1. How much money will they collect for selling&nbsp;</span><span>\( x \)</span><span>&nbsp;floor tickets?</span>
</div>
<div><span><br></span></div>
<div><span>2. How much money will they collect for selling&nbsp;</span><span>\( y \)</span><span>&nbsp;balcony tickets?</span><br></div>
<div><span><br></span></div>
<div><span>3. Write an inequality whose solutions are the number of floor and balcony tickets sold if they make at least $3,000 in ticket sales.</span><br><span><br></span></div>
<div><span>4. Use technology to graph the solutions to your inequality, and sketch the graph.<br><br></span>
