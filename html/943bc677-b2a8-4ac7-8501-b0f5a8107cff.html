<h4>Comparing Populations</h4>
<p>Graphs are very useful for comparing two or more functions. Here are graphs of functions \(C\) and \(T\), which give
  the populations (in millions) of California and Texas in year \(x\).</p>

  <p>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample:</p>
  <p>Here is how to read the graph to find the larger population:</p>
  <p>On the horizontal axis, at 1920, the graph for Texas touches at about 5 million, while the graph for California
    touches at about 4 million.</p>
  <p>In 1920, Texas had a larger population than California.</p>
