<p>We looked at two different situations: one where the same amount was added each day, and one where the amount doubled
  each day. Ask students to reflect on the work done today, either verbally or in writing.</p>
<ul>
  <li> What happened in this lesson that surprised you? </li>
  <li> What happened in this lesson that confused you? </li>
  <li> What questions do you have about what you learned today? </li>
</ul>
<p>We looked at tables of values and expressions that represent two different patterns of growth. Ask students to
  summarize the key features of the two patterns using tables and situations from a classroom activity, or new tables
  and situations such as these.</p>
<p>This table shows the height, in centimeters, of water in a swimming pool as it is being filled.</p>

<p>Ask questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> How are the values in each table growing? </li>
  <li> Which table shows common differences? Which one shows common factors? </li>
  <li> What expression can we write to find the height of the water after 10 minutes? </li>
  <li> What expression can we write to find the number of possible outcomes for 7 coins? </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell students that throughout this unit, that will look at many situations where quantities grow or decrease by
  applying the same factor repeatedly.</p>
