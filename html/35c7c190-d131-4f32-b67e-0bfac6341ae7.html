<h4>Activity (40 minutes)</h4>
<p>This task provides students with a more open-ended modeling opportunity within a population context. Students consider the world population by decade from 1950 through 2000, and then examine the annual world population for the last 70 years. Data are not provided in the problem, allowing students to investigate using online resources.</p>
<p>If students use the online resource suggested in the lesson narrative for world population estimates, restrict their attention to one column of the table; the big list of numbers may still be intimidating. Ask students what an appropriate level of accuracy for reporting the world populations is (to the nearest 10 million will probably give the clearest pattern, to the nearest 100 million would also be mathematically appropriate). Because there is a lot of information, it could be worth uploading the data in advance so that students can see a visual display and the data could be distributed more readily.</p>
<p>No time estimate is specified for this activity as the length depends on the extent of students' research and analysis, as well as on decisions about how their models are to be presented and discussed.</p>
<p>Making graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically.</p>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<p>Display the following table from the task statement for all to see. Invite students to observe the table and share what they notice and what they wonder.</p>
<p>After students have worked on the first two problems, consider pausing for a discussion and showing a short video about the growth of world population. A video like this will help explain the incredible human population explosion of the last two hundred years and can be found by searching 'human population growth' in an online search engine. Due to limited resources, this growth cannot continue indefinitely, and we are likely nearing a turning point in the history of human population growth.Here are some example videos:

<h4> Student Response</h4>
<p>1. For example: No, a linear model is not appropriate. It took over 100 years for the population to increase from 1 billion to 2 billion but only 12 years for the population to increase from 6 billion to 7 billion. The number of years to grow by 1 billion has been steadily and rapidly decreasing. Since linear functions grow by equal amounts over equal intervals, world population is not well modeled by a linear function.</p>
<p>2. For example: The world population has been growing more and more rapidly since 1800, which indicates that its growth might be exponential. Looking more closely, it took 123 years for the population to double from 1 billion to 2 billion, then 47 years to double from 2 billion to 4 billion, and it looks like another 45 to 50 years to double again to 8 billion (based on the trend). So, since 1927, the world population in billions can be modeled by the function \(f\) where \(f(t)=2 \cdot 2^t\) and \(t\) is time (in groups of 50 years since 1927). But an exponential model will not work well for the entire period of time since 1804.</p>
<p>3. For example: There is quite a bit of variation in growth rates. For example, from 1963 to 1964 the growth rate is more than 1.96% while from 2013 to 2014 it is only about 1.17%. The general trend is toward a decreasing rate of growth. For the entire 67-year period, we could take an "average" and say that the rate of growth has been about 1.6%.</p>
<p>4. For example: At the beginning of the period, the population is increasing by about fifty million each year. This amount increases, and by the end, it is regularly increasing by about seventy million each year.</p>
<p>5. For example: Using 2.5 billion as the population in 1950 and an exponential model with growth of 1.6%, in 2050 the population, in billions, will be about \(2.5 \cdot (1.016)^{100}\) which is about 12.2 billion. This is probably too high because the growth rate has been steadily decreasing. Using a linear model with a slope of \(0.7 (\frac{7-2.5}{2011-19500} \approx .07 )\), the population, in billions, will be about \(2.5+100 \cdot 0.07\), which is about 9.5 billion. The very rapid growth of human population in recent years will eventually slow down&mdash;this is already seen in the percentage of growth calculations. Better medical care and food supply have helped sustain the growth, but resources are limited and so it must eventually come to an end. </p>
<h4>Student-Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>Another common model for population growth, which fixes some of the improbable predictions of the exponential model, is called a logistic model. A sample function \(f\) of this type is the function \(f(t)=\frac {10}{1+50 \cdot 2^{-t}}\)</p>
<p>Evaluate this function for integer values of \(t\) between 0 and 15. Describe qualitatively how this function differs from an exponential one. What happens to the world population in the long run according to this model?</p>
<h4> Student Response</h4>
<p>We have \(f(0) \approx 0.2\), after which the outputs of \(f\) gradually increase toward 10. Jumping to the end, we find \(f(13) \approx 9.939\), \(f(14) \approx 9.969\), and \(f(15) \approx 9.984\). We can see that the larger that \(t\) gets, the smaller \(2^{-t}\) gets, and so the denominator gets closer to 1, and the overall fraction approaches 10. So according to this model, in the long run, the world population would stabilize at around 10 billion.</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may not notice that the years in the table are not consecutive. Help point out that the table shows only the years at which the next billion person milestone was reached.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>The way the data is presented shows that the world population is not growing linearly. If it were, then it would take about the same number of years to grow by 1 billion. To bring this point home, ask questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> How many years did it take for the population to grow from 1 billion to 2 billion? (123 years) What about from 6 billion to 7 billion? (12 years) </li>
  <li> Why was that the case? Does that make sense? (With a smaller population, it is a larger percentage change to increase by 1 billion. With a larger population, however, growing by 1 billion is a smaller percentage change, so it does not take as long to happen.) </li>
</ul>
<p>To test whether or not the data might be exponential is more subtle. One good strategy is to check some doubling times. It took:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 123 years for the population to double from 1 billion to 2 billion </li>
  <li> 47 years for the population to double from 2 billion to 4 billion (and it looks like it will take maybe another 50 years for the population to double from 4 billion to 8 billion) </li>
  <li> 39 years to double from 3 to 6 billion </li>
</ul>
<p>Based on this information, an exponential model for the entire period of time is probably not the best (the growth rate was faster in the 20th century than in the 19th), but a couple of different exponential models might work well (i.e. one for each century). If students dig deeper into the data, they will find that a linear model is remarkably good for the past few decades. If the videos listed in the Launch were not shown earlier (after the first two problems), consider showing them here.</p>
<h5> Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<div>
  <p> Use this routine to support the whole-class discussion of whether the world population is growing linearly or exponentially. After each student shares, provide the class with the following sentence frames to help them respond: "I agree because&hellip;.&rdquo; or "I disagree because&hellip;.&rdquo; If necessary, revoice student ideas to demonstrate mathematical language use by restating a statement as a question in order to clarify, apply appropriate language, and involve more students. This will help students share their strategies and understanding in choosing a linear or exponential model for a set of data.</p>
