<p>Invite students to reflect on the strategies for writing equivalent quadratic expressions. Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> "In what ways are area diagrams useful for expanding expressions like \((x+4)(x+9)\)? Are there any drawbacks to drawing diagrams?" (The diagrams can help us see and keep track of the different parts of the factors that need to be multiplied and make sure they are all accounted for. Drawing a diagram every time we want to expand an expression would be time consuming.) </li>
  <li> "In what ways is using the distributive property helpful? Are there any drawbacks?" (Expanding expressions with the distributive property is probably quicker than drawing diagrams, but if we don't keep track of the terms closely, we may miss some terms that need to be multiplied.) </li>
  <li> "Which strategy would you choose to expand \((x+11)(2x+3)\) and write an equivalent expression? Why?" </li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
