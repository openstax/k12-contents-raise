    <p>Neither 4 nor 7 is a solution. Sample reasoning:</p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Substituting 4 into the equation gives \( 90.45=12.20(4)-7.15 \) or \(&nbsp;90.45=41.65&nbsp;\), which is not a true statement</li>
      <li>Substituting 7 into the equation gives \(&nbsp;90.45=78.25&nbsp;\), which is also false.</li>
      <li>The solution is 8. Substituting 8 into the equation gives \(&nbsp;90.45=90.45&nbsp;\), which is true.</li>

    <h4>Extending Your Thinking</h4>
    <p>Jada has a second option to earn money. She could help some neighbors with errands and computer work for $11 an hour. After reconsidering her schedule, Jada realizes that she has about 9 hours available to work one day of the weekend.</p>
    <p>Which option should she choose, sorting books at the bookstore or helping her neighbors? Explain your reasoning.</p>

    <p>You could argue either way, depending on the assumptions you make.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Sample responses:</p>
    <p>Jada should work at the bookstore because she would earn more there. Her pay would be $109.80, and after subtracting $7.15 for the bus fare, she would still earn $102.65. She would earn $99 from the other option.</p>
    <p>Jada should help her neighbors. Working 9 hours at the bookstore would mean a few dollars more than working 9 hours helping her neighbors, but it would also mean losing some personal time because of the travel involved.</p>
