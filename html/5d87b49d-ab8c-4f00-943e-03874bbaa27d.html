<h3>Activity: P4.1: Estimate Time to Charge a Battery</h3>
<p>Think about an electronic device with a battery that you have to charge on a regular basis.</p>
<ol>
  <li> What device is it? </li>
  <li> When you are using the device, approximately how long does it take the battery to go from 100% charged until the time you need to plug it in again to recharge? </li>
  <li> Approximately how long does it take to charge to 100% starting from 0% or nearly 0%? </li>
  <li> Approximately how long does it take to charge if you plugged in your device when the battery was 50% charged? </li>
  <li> How long do you think it would take to recharge the device to 100% from 50% compared to the time it would take if the device was at 0%? Would it be exactly half the time, more than half the time, or less than half the time it would take if starting from 0%? </li>
</ol>
<h3>Activity: P4.2: Analyze Percent Change Over Time</h3>
<p>A cell phone is plugged in to be charged. The table shows the percent of battery power at a few times after it was plugged in.</p>
<p>At what time will the battery be 100% charged?</p>
<p>Use the data to find out and be prepared to show your reasoning.</p>

<h3>Activity: P4.3: Write an Equation to Model Data</h3>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" >
  <li> The image shows the battery usage of a cell phone 9 hours after it was fully charged. </li>
</ol>
<p>It also shows a prediction that the battery would last 8 more hours.</p>
<p><img alt="Advanced battery usage, 52 percent. Graph from 100 percent to 0 percent. 9 hours ago, 8 hours left." src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/666Mo5o5au7PlrDcQtV2OQVHEKeAXlVNLN0EWg5ugDUlwf-4CpNe3SZMhVYGLcVeuZGEUlPcSS4gVy8TrDv7kGsmS33wVbhN5yyjJCoo0km_nxSAmZOjsdXtsJNhA90gl8LxXS0AFj4mHZ8SoekmHLo" width="300" height="329" /></p>
<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="2" >
  <li> Write an equation for a model that fits the data in the image and gives the percent of battery power as a function of time since the phone was fully charged. Be prepared to show your reasoning.
    If you get stuck, consider creating a table of values or a scatter plot of the data. </li>
</ol>
<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li> Based on your function, what percentage of power would the battery have 4 hours after this image was taken? What about 5 hours after the image was taken? Be prepared to show your reasoning. </li>
</ol>
<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li> Here are two more images showing the battery usage at two later times, before the battery was charged again. </li>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5" >
  <li> How well did the function you wrote predict the battery power 4 and 5 hours after the first image was taken (that is, 13 and 14 hours after the battery was fully charged)? Be prepared to show your reasoning. </li>
