<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity gives students another opportunity to write and rearrange equations in two variables and to do so in
  context.</p>
<p>Unlike in previous activities, students no longer start by computing one quantity given numerical values of the other
  quantity and then generalizing the process. Instead, they are prompted to write one equation, solve for each variable,
  and interpret the solution. Students also articulate why one model might be more helpful than the other under a
  certain circumstance. Along the way, students reason quantitatively and abstractly and engage in aspects of
  modeling.</p>
<p>Making spreadsheet technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Familiarize students with the idea of organizational budgets, if needed. Explain that every governmental agency has a
  budget (not unlike a budget for a pizza party) and needs to decide how to allocate a limited amount of funds. Ask
  students to think of examples of expenses that a city&rsquo;s Department of Streets might have (road repairs, new
  street construction, additional workers, new equipment, and so on). Given a set budget, spending more on one thing
  means having less to spend on something else, so the agency would need to weigh its options and prioritize its needs.

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>The Department of Streets of a city has a budget of $1,962,800 for resurfacing roads and hiring additional
  workers this year.</p>
<p>The cost of resurfacing a mile of 2-lane road is estimated at $84,000. The average starting salary of a
  worker in the department is $36,000 a year. </p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may have trouble sorting out the given information because of unfamiliarity with the
  context or with certain terms. Ask them to explain the setup of the problem as best they understand
  it, and then point out any information that might be missing.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Verify that the equations students wrote correctly isolate each variable. If students wrote
  expressions in different forms for a variable (for instance, \(
  \frac {4,907 - 201m}{91} \) and \( \frac {1,962,800
  -84,000m}{36,400} \) for \( p \)), discuss how the
  expressions are equivalent.</p>
<p>If time permits, consider asking students to use their equations to answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;How many people could be hired if the department is resurfacing 16 miles of roads?&rdquo;
    (17 people) &ldquo;3 miles?&rdquo; (47 people)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How many miles of roads could be resurfaced if the department is hiring 2 new
    workers?&rdquo; (22.5 miles) &ldquo;If no new workers are hired?&rdquo; (About 23.37 miles)</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure students understand that solving for \( p \) makes it
  possible to quickly find the number of people that the department could hire given some miles of
  road to be resurfaced (and while sticking to the budget). Similarly, solving for \( m \) makes it possible to quickly
  find the miles that could be
  resurfaced given any number of new hires.</p>
<h4>1.9.3: Self Check</h4>

<p> formula is actually finding equivalent equations.</p>
<p>To solve a formula for a specific variable
  means to isolate that variable on one side of the equal sign with a coefficient of 1. All other
  variables and constants are on the other side of the equal sign. To see how to solve a formula for a
  specific variable, we will start with the distance, rate, and time formula.</p>
