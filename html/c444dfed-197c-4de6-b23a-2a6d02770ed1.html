<h3>Activity: Designing a Fountain (40 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement </h4>
<p>A nearby park has a decorative pool, and the board of commissioners of the park is</p>
<p>considering installing water jets in the pool to make it into a fountain. They have asked you</p>
<p>to design the water jets. Here is a diagram of the pool from above:</p>
<p><img height="400" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/9e747d4c00e1e9d7559e11184081389afe59098d" width="400"></p>
<ul>
<li> A and B are statues which are 4 feet tall.&nbsp; </li>
<li> C and D are wider statues which are 5.5 feet tall.&nbsp; </li>
<li> E is a statue with a vase on top, which is 8 feet tall.&nbsp; </li>
<li> The pool is 15 feet wide. </li>
</ul>
<p>The diagram is drawn to scale. The dots along the edge show where jets can be placed. You don&rsquo;t have to put jets in all five places. The jets will be at water level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will need to figure out how many jets there should be, where they should go, and what path the water should make. Your design needs to meet these criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li> The jets can only go in the places indicated by the dots. </li>
<li> There must be at least two jets. </li>
<li> The water can&rsquo;t hit any of the statues. </li>
<li> Some water must go into the vase. </li>
<li> The water can&rsquo;t go higher than 10 feet. </li>
</ul>
<p>When you have your final design, you should create a presentation to explain it to the commissioners. The presentation should show the paths of the water and include your mathematical descriptions of the paths.</p>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<p>From measuring the circles, I can tell that the small statues are about 2 feet wide, the larger ones are about 2.5 feet wide, and the vase is about 3.5 feet wide. The centers of the small statues are about 3 feet from the edge of the pool, the centers of the large statues are about 4 feet from the corners, and the center of the vase is 7.5 feet from the edge. I decided to put the water jets where the red dots are in this picture:</p>

<p>The equations for the top two jets are the same. Here is what they will look like.</p>

<p>If \((0, 0)\) is the location of the jet, then the equation is \(y=-\frac {9}{33.0625}(x&minus;5.75)^2+9\).</p>
<p>I decided to make the other jet shoot the water lower so that it wouldn&rsquo;t go into the vase. This is what it looks like:</p>

<p>The equation for this jet is \(y=- \frac {5}{625}(x&minus;2.5)^2+5\).</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>If students aren&rsquo;t sure how to get started, suggest that they sketch a coordinate grid on top of their sketch(es) of the pool from the side. They can then choose an origin and fill in the values they know. It is important for students to note that the diagram is drawn to scale and the pool is 15 feet wide. Sketching in a reasonable path for the water should help them estimate the vertex.</p>
<p>Having access to graphing technology will streamline the process of testing different equations, so making technology available is recommended. Consider demonstrating how to use sliders in Desmos to adjust the parameters of a quadratic equation in vertex form. For example, if \(y=-a(x-h)^2+k\) is used to represent a generic quadratic that opens down, students can easily experiment with its shape by moving sliders on \(a\), \(h\), and \(k\).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>The purpose of this discussion is for students to communicate how they used mathematics to justify their findings. Have students present their equations and explain how they found them.</p>
<p>Ask students:</p>
<ul>
<li> What information did you use to find the equation? (The center of the fountain is 7.5 feet from the edge. I drew a sketch to start at \((0, 0)\) and the path that would end near \((7.5,8)\). I found the vertex would be about 5.75 feet and I wanted the height to be 9 feet. I used vertex form to find a and found the equation \(y=-\frac {9}{33.0625}(x&minus;5.75)2+9)\).&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
<li> "How can you tell if your model meets the criteria? (I graphed the equation \(y=- \frac {9}{33.0625}(x&minus;5.75)^2+9\) and checked that the height would be above around 8 feet near the center of the statue, which is 7.5 feet. The point \((7.667, 8)\) is on the graph, so the fountain hits the vase. The maximum height is 9 feet, so the equation meets the criteria for being less than 10 feet.) </li>
</ul>
