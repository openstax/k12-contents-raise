<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp; \(1.4x - 4.2 =12.8 \),&nbsp;\( 1.4x = 17 \),&nbsp;\( 14x - 42 =128 \),&nbsp;\( 14x =170 \)</p>
<p>4. <strong>Select all </strong>of the equations that are equivalent to \( 3x -6 =12 \).</p>
<p>A:\( 3x = 6 \)</p>
<p>B: \( 3(x-2) = 12 \)</p>
<p>C: \( x - 2 =4 \)</p>
<p>D: \( x - 2 = 12 \)</p>
<p>E: \( x -6 = 4 \)</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>&nbsp;\( 3(x-2) = 12 \),&nbsp;&nbsp;\( x - 2 =4 \)</p>
<p>5. Identify the step in which the mistake is made in finding an equivalent equation to \( 2(x - 4) = 16 \).</p>
<p>Step 1: \( 2x -4 = 16 \)<br>Step 2: \( 2x =20 \)<br>Step 3: \( x =10 \)</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Step 1. Distribute the 2 to both terms in the parentheses.</p>
<p>6. Identify the step in which the mistake is made in finding an equivalent equation to \( 2x +3x -4 = 20 \).</p>
<p>Step 1: \( 5x - 4 =20 \)<br>Step 2: \( 5x = 16 \)<br>Step 3: \( x = \frac{16}{5} \)</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Step 2. The student should add 4 to both sides of the equation.</p>
<p>7. Identify the step in which the mistake is made in finding an equivalent equation to \( 7x - 4x - 5 =16 \).</p>
<p>Step 1: \( 3x -5 =16 \)<br>Step 2: \( 3x = 21 \)<br>Step 3: \( x =62 \)</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Step 3. The student should divide both sides of the equation by 3.</p>
<p>8. Fill in the blank to complete the equivalent equation to \( 3(x - 5) = 30 \).</p>
<p>\( 3x -&nbsp; \) ____ \(&nbsp;= 30 \)</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> 15. Distribute the 3 to the 5 with multiplication.</p>
<p>9. Fill in the blank to complete the equivalent equation to \( \frac{x}{2}-5=11 \).</p>
<p>\( x - \) ______ \(&nbsp;= 22 \)</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> 10</p>
<p>10. Fill in the blank to complete the equivalent equation to \( 3(x - 9) = 24 \).</p>
<p>\( x - \) ____ \(&nbsp;= 8 \)</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> 9</p>
