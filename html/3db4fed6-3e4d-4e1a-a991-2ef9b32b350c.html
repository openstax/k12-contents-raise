<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students contrast visual patterns that show quadratic relationships with those that show linear and
  exponential relationships. To analyze the patterns, students generate tables of values, write expressions, and create
  graphs. They also encounter the term <em>quadratic expression</em> and learn that a quadratic relationship can be
  written using an expression with a squared term.</p>
<p>Discerning and extending different patterns of change prompt students to look for and make use of structure.
  Generating tables of values and generalizing the relationships prompts students to express regularity in repeated
  reasoning.</p>
<p>Technology isn&rsquo;t required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use
  appropriate tools to solve problems. Consider making technology available, in case it is requested.</p>
  <p>Activity 7.2.4 provides an opportunity for students to explain their work algebraically and written in complete sentences. Encourage all learners, especially EL students to use apostrophe s correctly, use contractions correctly, as well as other grammer rules. Provide feedback to students to extend their details in their writing and use appropriate sentence lengths, combining phrases as they acquire more English. </p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Comprehend that a &ldquo;quadratic relationship&rdquo; can be expressed with a squared term. </li>
  <li> Describe (orally and in writing) a pattern of change associated with a quadratic relationship. </li>
  <li> Determine and explain (orally and in writing) whether a visual pattern represents a linear, exponential, or
    quadratic relationship. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Describe how a pattern is growing. </li>
  <li> Tell whether a pattern is growing linearly, exponentially, or quadratically. </li>
  <li> Explain that an expression with a squared term is called quadratic. </li>
</ul>
