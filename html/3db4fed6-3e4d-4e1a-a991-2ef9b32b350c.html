<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students contrast visual patterns that show quadratic relationships with those that show linear and
  exponential relationships. To analyze the patterns, students generate tables of values, write expressions, and create
  graphs. They also encounter the term <em>quadratic expression</em> and learn that a quadratic relationship can be
  written using an expression with a squared term.</p>
<p>Discerning and extending different patterns of change prompt students to look for and make use of structure.
  Generating tables of values and generalizing the relationships prompts students to express regularity in repeated
  reasoning.</p>
<p>Technology isn&rsquo;t required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use
  appropriate tools to solve problems. Consider making technology available, in case it is requested.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Comprehend that a &ldquo;quadratic relationship&rdquo; can be expressed with a squared term. </li>
  <li> Describe (orally and in writing) a pattern of change associated with a quadratic relationship. </li>
  <li> Determine and explain (orally and in writing) whether a visual pattern represents a linear, exponential, or
    quadratic relationship. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Describe how a pattern is growing. </li>
  <li> Tell whether a pattern is growing linearly, exponentially, or quadratically. </li>
  <li> Explain that an expression with a squared term is called quadratic. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines. </p>
<ul>
  <li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
