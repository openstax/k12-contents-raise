<li>A rocket is launched in the air and its height, in feet, is modeled by the function \(h\).</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a graph representing \(h\).</p>
<p><img alt="A parabola on a coordinate grid. The x-axis represents time in seconds and the y-axis represents the height in feet. The x-axis scale is 1 and extends from 0 to 8.

<p><strong>Select three</strong> true statements about the situation.</p>
<ul>
<li> The rocket is launched from a height less than 20 feet above the ground. </li>
<li> The rocket is launched from about 20 feet above the ground. </li>
<li> The rocket reaches its maximum height after about 3 seconds. </li>
<li> The rocket reaches its maximum height after about 160 seconds. </li>
<li> The maximum height of the rocket is about 160 feet.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The rocket is launched from a height less than 20 feet above the ground. The rocket reaches
  its maximum height after about 3 seconds. The maximum height of the rocket is about 160 feet.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Yes. The coordinates plotted on the graph match the data in the table: \((0,0)\),
  \((0.5,1.25)\), \((1,5)\), \((1.5,11.25)\), \((2,20)\). </p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="7" type="a">
<li> Is the baseball traveling at a constant speed? </li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>No. The distance traveled is not changing at a constant speed; it is increasing over time.
  For example, in the first half second, it travels 1.25 meters, and in the next half second, it travels 3.75 meters.
