<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>This task reviews an important property of exponents that students have studied in grade 8 and again in lesson 5.1, namely that if \(b\) is a non-zero number, then \(b^0=1\). This is a convention, one that allows the rule \(b^x\cdot b^y=b^{\left(x+y\right)}\) to remain true when \(x\) or \(y\) is allowed to be 0. An additional convention, which is not addressed in this task, states that \(b^{-n}=\frac1{b^n}\) for a whole number \(n\). With these conventions, the equation \(b^x\cdot b^y=b^{x+y}\) is true for all integers \(x\) and \(y\).</p>

    </li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>We know, for example, that \((2+3)+5=2+(3+5)\) and \(2\cdot\left(3\cdot 5\right)=\left(2\cdot 3\right)\cdot 5\). The grouping with parentheses does not affect the value of the expression.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Is this true for exponents? That is, are the numbers \(2^{\left(3^5\right)}\) and \(\left(2^3\right)^5\) equal? If not, which is bigger? <br><br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> The two numbers are not even close! Since \(3^5=243\), the number \(2^{\left(3^5\right)}\) is \(2^{243}\). On the other hand, \(\left(2^3\right)^5=2^3\cdot2^3\cdot2^3\cdot2^3\cdot2^3=2^{15}\). The number \(2^{243}\) is much larger than \(2^{15}\).
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> Which of the two would you choose as the meaning of the expression \(2^{3^5}\) written without parentheses? <br><br>
    <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Typically, we define repeated exponents by working down the tower, e.g., \(2^{3^5}=2^{\left(3^5\right)}\). One reason for this is that evaluating up the tower, as in \(\left(2^3\right)^5\), can already be simplified by using algebra rules (in this case, to get \(2^{15}\)).
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may think that \(a^0=0\). First, remind them that exponents are not the same as multiplication (for example, \(4^3=4\cdot4\cdot 4\), and \(4\cdot 4\cdot 4\) is very different from \(4\cdot3\)). Next, ask them to use the patterns that they notice in the equations and tables to determine the correct value.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Make sure students understand that \(5^0=1\) is an agreed-upon definition. The reason for defining \(5^0\) this way is so that the property \(\left(5^a\cdot5^b=5^{a+b}\right)\) continues to hold when we allow 0 as an exponent.</p>
<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<div>
  <p>Before students share their explanations for the last question, present an incorrect answer and explanation. For example, &ldquo;5 to the power of 0 is 0, because I multiplied to get it.&rdquo; Ask students to identify the error, critique the reasoning, and write a correct explanation. As students discuss with a partner, listen for students who identify and clarify the ambiguous language in the statement. Invite students to share their critiques and corrected explanations with the class. Listen for and amplify the language students use to describe what happens when a number is raised to the power of 0 and highlight those who use patterns in the table. This helps students evaluate, and improve on, the written mathematical arguments of others as they clarify their understanding of the power of 0.</p>

        Santos is correct because anything raised to the zero power is 1.

        Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: Santos is correct that anything to the zero power is 1, but he forgot about the 4 multiplied outside the parentheses. The answer is Sara, because after the parentheses simplifies to 1, you would still need to multiply by 4.

        Both Santos and Sara are correct since there are two methods to solve the problem.

      <td>
        Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: Remember to use order of operations. There may be more than one method, but all methods should result in the same answer. The answer is Sara, because after the parentheses simplifies to 1, you would still need to multiply by 4.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Sara is correct because you first would simplify the parentheses, and since it&rsquo;s raised to the zero power, it would be 1. Then you would multiply that by 4, for a final answer of 4.
      </td>
      <td>
        That&rsquo;s correct! Check yourself: Remember when multiple operations are involved to use the order of operations. This problem would result in \(4\cdot1\) or 4.

<h4>Zero as an Exponent</h4>
<p>Why is \(2^0=1\) and \(5^0=1\), but \(2^3\) is not the same as \(5^3\)?</p>
<p>Answering this question will help us understand the <span>zero exponent rule</span>.</p>
<p>Exponents in general represent repeated multiplication, much like multiplication represents repeated addition. Let&rsquo;s use that understanding to evaluate \(2^3\) and \(5^3\):</p>
<p> \(2^3=2\cdot2\cdot2=4\cdot2=8\)</p>
<p> \(5^3=5\cdot5\cdot5=25\cdot5=125\)</p>
<p>8 and 125 are obviously very different, but the method to get to each answer was the same. If we rewrite it as a table, we can work backward to understand how \(2^0\) and \(5^0\) are both 1.</p>
<p>Using \(y=2^x\) and filling in the parts we have found results in Table 1:</p>

<p>Since exponents represent repeated multiplication in both tables, additional terms are found by multiplying again by the base. What if we worked backward? If you multiply to move to the right in the table, you can divide by the common ratio to work backward. Start with the 8, and work backward to fill in the table:</p>

<p>After you have worked backward in each table, you will see that \(2^0\) and \(5^0\) both equal 1. When 1 is the exponent, your answer is the same as the common ratio, so when you divide by the common ratio, you end up with 1 as your answer every time. This is an important rule that can save a lot of time.</p>
<h4>Try It: Zero as an Exponent</h4>
<p>Find the value of each of the following:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> \(3^0\) </li>
  <li> \(1,246^0\)</li>
  <li>\(
    \left(2\cdot3\cdot7\right)^0\)</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Here is how to use the zero exponent rule to determine the value of each:</p>
<p>The answer to each expression is 1. If you want to work backward, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how large the original number is. \(3\div3=1\) and \(1246\div1246=1\), and both expressions only contain a base and zero as exponent, so the answer is 1. For c, there is an expression inside the parentheses that you can evaluate first, but since it is still the base raised to a zero exponent, the answer will still be one.</p>
