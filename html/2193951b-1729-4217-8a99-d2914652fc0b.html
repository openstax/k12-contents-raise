<p>In this unit, students will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simplify radical expressions involving square roots.</li>
  <li>Solve quadratic equations by taking the square root, completing the square, and using the quadratic formula.</li>
</ul>
<p>To accomplish these unit-level learning goals, students will complete the following lessons and activities.</p>
<h3>Student Readiness for Unit 9</h3>
<p>To be ready for this unit, students will need to be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Solve linear equations using a general strategy.</li>
  <li>Classify equations.</li>
  <li>Identify points on a graph.</li>
</ul>
<p>To assess studentsâ€™ mastery of prerequisite skills, start with the Overview and Readiness section at the beginning of each unit in the student textbook. Each Unit Overview includes three assessment questions, each paired with a mini-lesson. If a student struggles with a question, the corresponding mini-lesson can be used in a small group, assigned as pre-work, or integrated into the unit content.  
<br>
Mini-lessons include videos covering the prerequisite skills along with Try It and Check Your Understanding questions that can be used for additional practice or assessment. 
</p>

<p>This Unit Overview Video will provide a big picture look at the content found in this unit as well as the prerequisite skills that students need for accessing the content in the unit.</p>

      <h3>Vertical Alignment for Unit 9</h3>
      <p>What is vertical alignment? You may be familiar with aligning your math lesson to a set of standards. But what does TEA mean when they discuss the importance of vertical alignment? Vertical alignment documents the progression of learning from grade level to grade level.</p>
      <p>Students learn many different sets of knowledge and skills related to mathematics that build upon each other. Understanding this progression of learning across the curriculum continuum provides teachers and administrators the ability to better support mathematical conceptual and skill-based development.</p>
      <p>As a teacher, understanding the TEKS mathematical vertical alignment will help you better understand what your students have already mastered and how what you are teaching them will be critical for mastery in future learning opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>For Algebra I teachers, we recommend using the Texas Education Agency&rsquo;s <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c1d455b65dade9bf6cba34312c3742132cb76c48" target="_blank">TEKS Vertical Alignment Chart Grades 5 through Algebra 1 and Algebra 2</a>. To understand how to read and use the Vertical Alignment chart, watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1xp5nd44Eg;&rel=0" target="_blank">introductory video</a>.</p>
      <p>Watch this video walkthrough of using the vertical alignment to better understand your students&rsquo; readiness for learning new content in each unit of the course.</p>
