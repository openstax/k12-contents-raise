<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity prompts students to find a way to factor a polynomial in which there is not a common factor in all of the terms of the polynomial. By grouping different parts of the polynomial together, they can find a GCF for each individual part. If the polynomial can be factored, a common factor will emerge from both parts.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Start the lesson by explaining that some polynomials will not have a common factor in all of their terms. Use the polynomial in the first example to illustrate this point, \(ms &minus; 4m + 7s &minus; 28\). Challenge students to find any common factor in all the terms of the polynomial.</p>
<p>Explain that polynomials can be split into smaller parts, and we can start factoring there. Review the example step by step. Check for understanding after each step.</p>
<p>Finally, ask students to complete questions 1&ndash;8 individually. If needed, solve the first one together as a class.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>If there is no common term in all of the terms of a polynomial, it may be possible to factor by grouping. To do this, separate the polynomial into two parts with two terms in each part. Then look for the GCF in each part. If the polynomial can be factored, you will find that a common factor emerges from both parts.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example. Factor the following polynomial.</p>
<p>\(ms &minus; 4m + 7s &minus; 28\)</p>

<p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong></p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Group terms with common factors.<br>
  Is there a GCF of all four terms? No, so let&rsquo;s separate the first two terms from the second two.<br>
  \(ms &minus; 4m + 7s &minus; 28\)<br>

</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Factor out the common factor in each group.<br>
  Factor the GCF from the first two terms. Factor the GCF from the second two terms.<br>
  \(m(s &minus; 4) + 7s &minus; 28\)<br>
  \(m(s &minus; 4) + 7(s &minus; 4)\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Factor the common factor from the expression.<br>
  Notice that each term has a common factor of \((s &minus; 4)\). Factor out the common factor.<br>
  \(m
  {\style{color:red}(}
  {\style{color:red}s} \;{\style{color:red}-}\;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{\style{color:red}4}
  {\style{color:red})}
  + 7{\style{color:red}(}
  {\style{color:red}s}\;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{\style{color:red}-}\;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{\style{color:red}4}
  {\style{color:red})}\)<br>
  \((s &minus; 4)(m + 7)\)</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  Check.<br>
  Multiply \((s &minus; 4)(m + 7)\). Is the product the original expression?<br>
  \((s &minus; 4)(m + 7)\)<br>
  \(ms +7s &minus; 4m &minus; 28\)<br>
  \(ms &minus; 4m + 7s &minus; 28\)

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Emphasize to students that if the first two terms do not have a common factor, that does not guarantee that the polynomial cannot be factored by grouping. They should still look for a GCF in the last two terms. It might also be possible to rearrange the terms so that the polynomial can be factored by grouping. Students should check all possibilities before determining that a polynomial is prime.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Ask students to write down the steps used when factoring by grouping. Use the list below to guide students as needed:</p>
<p> Step 1<br> Group terms with common factors.</p>
<p> Step 2<br> Factor out the common factor in each group. </p>
<p> Step 3<br> Factor out the common factor from the expression. </p>
<p> Step 4<br> Check your answer by multiplying the factors together. </p>
<p>Ask students how many unique ways there are to group a polynomial with four terms into two pairs of terms.</p>
<p>There are 3 ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Grouping the first two terms together</li>
  <li> Grouping the first and third terms together</li>
  <li> Grouping the first and last terms together</li>
</ul>

<h4>Factoring Polynomials by Grouping</h4>
<p>Sometimes there is no common factor of all the terms of a polynomial. When there are four terms, we separate the polynomial into two parts with two terms in each part. Then look for the GCF in each part. If the polynomial can be factored, you will find that a common factor emerges from both parts. Not all polynomials can be factored. Just like some numbers are prime, some polynomials are prime.</p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLE 1</strong></p>
<p>Factor by grouping: \(xy + 3y + 2x + 6\).</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Group terms with common factors.<br>
  Is there a greatest common factor of all four terms?<br>
  \(xy + 3y + 2x + 6\)<br>
  No, so let&rsquo;s separate the first two terms from the second two.<br>

</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Factor out the common factor in each group.<br>
  Factor the GCF from the first two terms.<br>

  Factor the GCF from the second two terms.<br>
  \(y(x + 3) + 2(x + 3)\)
</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Factor the common factor from the expression. <br>
  Notice that each term has a common factor of \((x+3)\).<br>
  \(y {\style{color:red}(}
  {\style{color:red}x} \;{\style{color:red}+}\;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{\style{color:red}3}
  {\style{color:red})} + 2 {\style{color:red}(}
  {\style{color:red}x}\;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{\style{color:red}+}\;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{\style{color:red}3}
  {\style{color:red})}
  \)<br>
  Factor out the common factor.<br>
  \((x + 3)(y + 2)\)</p>
<p>Step 4 <br>
  Check.<br>
  Multiply \((x + 3)(y + 2)\). Is the product the original expression?<br>
  \((x + 3)(y + 2)\) <br>
  \(xy + 2x + 3y + 6\)<br>
  \(xy + 3y + 2x + 6 \checkmark\)</p>
