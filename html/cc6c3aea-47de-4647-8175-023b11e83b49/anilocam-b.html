<p>In this lesson, you will write a system of equations from a table of values, graphs, and situations. You will also be able to graph systems by hand and use graphs of systems of equations to estimate real world solutions.</p>

<p>Below are the knowledge and skills you will practice in this lesson. Before you begin, read each one and rate how much you currently know about each one. It&rsquo;s okay if your ratings are low; the purpose of this is to check in with yourself about what you do or do not yet know.</p>
<p><strong>Can you...</strong></p>
