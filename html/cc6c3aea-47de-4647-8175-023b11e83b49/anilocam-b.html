<p>In this lesson, you will write a system of equations from a table of values, graphs, and situations. You will also be able to graph systems by hand and use graphs of systems of equations to estimate real world solutions.</p>

<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Write a system of equations from tables of values and graphs. </li>
  <li> Graph systems of equations by hand. </li>
  <li> Estimate real-world solutions by graphing systems of equations. </li>
</ul>

<p>Below are the knowledge and skills you will practice in this lesson. Before you begin, read each one and rate how much you currently know about each one. It’s okay if your ratings are low; the purpose of this is to check in with yourself about what you do or do not yet know.</p>
