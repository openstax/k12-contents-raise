<p>In this lesson, you will write a system of equations from a table of values, graphs, and situations. You will also be able to graph systems by hand and use graphs of systems of equations to estimate real world solutions.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Write a system of equations from tables of values and graphs. </li>
  <li> Graph systems of equations by hand. </li>
  <li> Estimate real-world solutions by graphing systems of equations. </li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 2.2.1: Interpreting Graphs of Systems of Equations </li>
  <li> 2.2.2: Writing Systems of Equations from Tables </li>
  <ul>
    <li> 2.2.2: Self Check </li>
    <li> 2.2.2: Additional Resources </li>
