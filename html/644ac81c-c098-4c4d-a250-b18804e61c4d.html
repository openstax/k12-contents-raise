<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Recognize the factored form of a quadratic expression and know when it can be useful for solving problems. </li>
  <li> Use a graph to find the solutions to a quadratic equation but also know its limitations. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> 8.2.1: Interpreting Equations in Context </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you interpreted an equation representing a real-world situation to answer different questions about that situation. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 8.2.2: Exploring Non-Graphing Strategies to Solve Quadratic Equations </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you tried to solve a quadratic equation using trial and error. You learned that a strategy such as this might be difficult to use when the solutions are harder to find. </li>
    <li> 8.2.2: Self Check </li>
    <li> 8.2.2: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 8.2.3: Solving a Quadratic Equation Set Equal to Zero </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you continued exploring how to solve quadratic equations. You learned that a quadratic equation that has been set equal to zero provides more opportunities for how to solve it. You set quadratic equations equal to zero when possible to find solutions in context. </li>
    <li> 8.2.3: Self Check </li>
    <li> 8.2.3: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 8.2.4: Solving a Real-World Problem Using Quadratic Equations </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you solved a real-world problem using the skills learned in the lesson. By developing a better understanding of quadratic equations, you also better understand the context of a real-world situation. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
