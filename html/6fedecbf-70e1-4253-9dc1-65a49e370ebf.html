<p>Equations are useful not only for representing relationships that change exponentially, but also for answering questions about these situations. In this lesson, students used data from a table to construct equations representing exponential growth and decay. They used these equations to answer questions given the context of the situation.</p>
<p>To help students, review the following points:</p>
<ul>
  <li> We looked at some situations where negative values (exponents) representing units of times are meaningful. In those cases, a value of &ndash;1 might represent 1 year before a particular time when an estimate or census occurred. </li>
  <li> Choosing the appropriate labels and tick marks on the axes is important for correctly displaying a graph. Make sure you select intervals that can help differentiate among points but still allow for the display of every point in the data. </li>
  <li> When trying to compare values that are in decimal form and scientific notation, first convert all the values into one form or the other. </li>
  <li> Values written in scientific notation can be used to solve problems in context just like values in decimal form. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
