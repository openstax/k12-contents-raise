<p dir="ltr">To help students connect the various ideas in this lesson and articulate their understanding, ask them questions such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;How would you explain &lsquo;equivalent equations&rsquo; to a classmate who is absent today?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;The equation \(5𝑦=6\) represents purchasing 5 tubs of yogurt for $6. In this equation, what does the solution represent?&rdquo; (the cost of one tub of yogurt)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Which of these equations are equivalent to the equation&nbsp;\( 5𝑦=6 \) (about the yogurt)? How do you know?&rdquo;<ul>
      <li>\( 15𝑦=18 \)<br></li>
      <li>\(&nbsp;5𝑦=12&nbsp;\)</li>
      <li>\(&nbsp;5𝑦+4=10&nbsp;\)</li>
      <li>\(&nbsp;5𝑦&minus;1=3&nbsp;\)<br>(The first and the third equations are equivalent to the original equation because they have the same solution. There is an acceptable move that was done to the original equation to get to these equivalent equations: multiplying each side of the equal sign by 3, and adding 4 to each side of the equation.)<br><br></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>&ldquo;For the equations that you think are equivalent, what do they mean in the context of the yogurt purchase?&rdquo; (The equation&nbsp;\( 15𝑦=18 \) can be interpreted as: buying 3 times as many tubs of yogurt costs 3 times as much. The third equation can be interpreted as: the total cost of 5 tubs of yogurt and something else that costs $4 is $10.)</li>
