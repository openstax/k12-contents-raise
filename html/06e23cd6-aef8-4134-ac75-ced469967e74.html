<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>This lesson challenges students to recognize polynomials of many different forms. After assessing the form of the polynomial, and with no other context, students will select an appropriate strategy for factoring the polynomial. They will then implement that strategy by factoring the polynomial down to its fully factored form, where all the factors are prime.</p>
<p>Additionally, students will analyze an expression to determine if it is prime or fully factored, or if it can be factored further.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Analyze a polynomial by its form, select an appropriate strategy for factoring, and correctly factor the polynomial down to its prime factors. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
<li> Recognize and use the appropriate method to factor a polynomial completely. </li>
</ul>
