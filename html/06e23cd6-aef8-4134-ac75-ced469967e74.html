<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>This lesson challenges students to recognize polynomials of many different forms. After assessing the form of the polynomial, and with no other context, students will select an appropriate strategy for factoring the polynomial. They will then implement that strategy by factoring the polynomial down to its fully factored form, where all the factors are prime.</p>
<p>Additionally, students will analyze an expression to determine if it is prime or fully factored, or if it can be factored further.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Analyze a polynomial by its form, select an appropriate strategy for factoring, and correctly factor the polynomial down to its prime factors. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Recognize and use the appropriate method to factor a polynomial completely. </li>
</ul>

<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines. </p>
<ul>
 <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment</li> 
 <li>ELPS 3(C) speak using a variety of grammatical structures, sentence lengths, sentence types, and connecting words with increasing accuracy and ease as more English is acquired</li>
 <li>ELPS 3(D) speak using grade-level content area vocabulary in context to internalize new English words and build academic language proficiency</li>
 <li>ELPS 3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions</li>
 <li>ELPS 3(I) adapt spoken language appropriately for formal and informal purposes</li>
</ul>
