<p>A movie theater models the revenue from ticket sales in one day as a function of the ticket price, \(p\). Here are two expressions defining the same revenue function.</p>
<p>\(p(120 &minus; 4p)\)</p>
<p>\(120p &minus; 4p^2\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>According to this model, how high would the ticket price have to be for the theater to make $0 in revenue? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> $30. If \(p(120 &minus; 4p) = 0\), then either \(p = 0\) or \(120 &minus; 4p = 0\). If the latter is a true equation, \(p\) must be 30.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>What equation can you write to find out what ticket price(s) would allow the theater to make $600 in revenue?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(p(120&minus;4p) = 600\) or \(120p &minus; 4p^2 = 600\)</p>
