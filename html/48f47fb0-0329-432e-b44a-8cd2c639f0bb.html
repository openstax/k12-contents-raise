<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>The purpose of this Math Talk is to elicit strategies and understandings students have for subtracting and dividing. These understandings help students develop fluency and will be helpful later in this lesson when students will need to be able to find the slope of the line through two given points.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Display one problem at a time. Give students quiet think time for each problem, and ask them to give a signal when they have an answer and a strategy. Keep all problems displayed throughout the talk. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Evaluate Mentally.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>\( \frac{102-96}{45-42}\) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 2</p>
<ol start="2">
  <li> \(\frac{-8-4}{6-2}\) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> -3</p>
<ol start="3">
  <li> \(\frac{31-18}{5-10}\) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(-\frac{13}{5}\)</p>
<ol start="4">
  <li> \(\frac{4-9}{12-18}\) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(\frac{5}{6}\)</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Ask students to share their strategies for each problem. Record and display their responses for all to see. To involve more students in the conversation, consider asking:</p>
<ul>
  <li> &ldquo;Who can restate _____&rsquo;s reasoning in a different way?&rdquo; </li>
  <li> &ldquo;Did anyone have the same strategy but would explain it differently?&rdquo; </li>
  <li> &ldquo;Did anyone solve the problem in a different way?&rdquo; </li>
  <li> &ldquo;Does anyone want to add on to _____&rsquo;s strategy?&rdquo; </li>
  <li> &ldquo;Do you agree or disagree? Why?&rdquo; </li>
</ul>
