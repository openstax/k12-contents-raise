<p>Here is a graph of \(y= f(x)\) where \(f(x) = 3x+2\).</p>
<p><img alt="A line graph with a red line increasing steadily from the point (0, 2) to about (6, 20) on a grid. The x-axis ranges from -2 to 10 and the y-axis ranges from 0 to 20." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="295" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/dbe8e515126db8d5055c1d1ac574a4b5688f3dbd" width="300"/></p>
<p>How do the values of \(f\) change whenever \(x\) increases by 2?</p>
