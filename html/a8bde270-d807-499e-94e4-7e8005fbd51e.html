<h4>What Do Residual Plots Tell Us?</h4>
<p><span>Residuals tell us how close to accurate a line of best fit really is.</span></p>
<p><span>Ideally, the residual from a line of best fit will be scattered randomly above and below the horizontal line of 0 on the residual plot. The residual plot would have points above and below the horizontal line of 0. This shows that the relationship between the two variables in the data set can be approximated by a linear model.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>When the residuals are on 0, this indicates that the line of best fit goes through those points.</p>
<p>A curved pattern shows that a nonlinear model would be better to describe the relationships between points.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kiran&rsquo;s line of best fit is the best because the graph of the residuals lets me know that some points are above the line of best fit and some are below. In addition, two of the residuals are close to 0, so that indicates that the line passes through or near those 2 points. Tylers line of best fit is not a good one because it is above all the data. Lin&rsquo;s line of best fit is below all the lower data values and above all the high data values, so it is not a good fit.</p>
