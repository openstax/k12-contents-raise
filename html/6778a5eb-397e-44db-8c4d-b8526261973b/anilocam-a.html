<p>Prior to this point, you have worked primarily with equations in one and
  two variables. In this lesson, you will shift your attention to
  inequalities. You will interpret, write, and find solutions to
  inequalities in one variable. </p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write inequalities that represent the constraints in a situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are the knowledge and skills you will practice in this lesson. Before you begin, read each one and rate how much you currently know about each one. It&rsquo;s okay if your ratings are low; the purpose of this is to check in with yourself about what you do or do not yet know.</p>
<p><strong>Can you...</strong></p>
