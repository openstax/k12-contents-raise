<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students study a situation characterized by exponential change and learn the term <span><em>growth factor</em></span> or <span><em>constant ratio</em></span>. They represent this relationship using a table, an expression, and a graph. They also explain the meaning of the numbers \(a\) and \(b\)&nbsp;in an exponential expression \(a\cdot b^x\), identifying their meaning in terms of a context (\(a\)&nbsp;is the initial amount, and \(b\)&nbsp;is the multiplier or growth factor) and also in terms of a graph (where \(a\)&nbsp;is the vertical intercept and \(b\)&nbsp;determines how quickly the graph increases). Students interpret the different representations of growth in terms of a bacteria population.</p>
<p>In this and following lessons, students will often work with properties of exponents, a topic developed in grade 8. There is also an activity to emphasize the convention that \(a^0=1\) for a non-zero number \(a\).</p>
<p>Technology isn&rsquo;t required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems. We recommend making technology available.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Explain (in writing) how to see \(a\) and \(b\) on the graph of an equation of the form \(y=a\cdot b^x\). </li>
  <li> Interpret \(a\) and \(b\) given equations of the form \(y=a\cdot b^x\) and a context of exponential growth. </li>
  <li> Write an equation of the form of \(y=a\cdot b^x\) to represent a quantity \(a\) that changes by a growth factor \(b\). </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Explain the connections between an equation and a graph that represents exponential growth. </li>
  <li> Write and interpret an equation that represents exponential growth. </li>

  <h4>Support for English Language Learners </h4>
  <p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>ELPS 1(E) internalize new basic and academic language by using and reusing it in meaningful ways in speaking and writing activities that build concept and language attainment </li>
    <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audio tape, video, DVD, and CD ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment </li>
    <li>ELPS 3(B) expand and internalize initial English vocabulary by learning and using high-frequency English words necessary for identifying and describing people, places, and objects, by retelling simple stories and basic information represented or supported by pictures, and by learning and using routine language needed for classroom communication </li>
    <li>ELPS 3(G) express opinions, ideas, and feelings ranging from communicating single words and short phrases to participating in extended discussions on a variety of social and grade- appropriate academic topics </li>
  </ul>
