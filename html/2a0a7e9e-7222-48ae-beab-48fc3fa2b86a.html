<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students study a situation characterized by exponential change and learn the term <span><em>growth factor</em></span> or <span><em>constant ratio</em></span>. They represent this relationship using a table, an expression, and a graph. They also explain the meaning of the numbers \(a\) and \(b\)&nbsp;in an exponential expression \(a\cdot b^x\), identifying their meaning in terms of a context (\(a\)&nbsp;is the initial amount, and \(b\)&nbsp;is the multiplier or growth factor) and also in terms of a graph (where \(a\)&nbsp;is the vertical intercept and \(b\)&nbsp;determines how quickly the graph increases). Students interpret the different representations of growth in terms of a bacteria population.</p>
<p>In this and following lessons, students will often work with properties of exponents, a topic developed in grade 8. There is an optional activity intended to remind students of the convention that \(a^0=1\) for a non-zero number \(a\).</p>
<p>Technology isn&rsquo;t required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems. We recommend making technology available.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Explain (in writing) how to see \(a\) and \(b\) on the graph of an equation of the form \(y=a\cdot b^x\). </li>
  <li> Interpret \(a\) and \(b\) given equations of the form \(y=a\cdot b^x\) and a context of exponential growth. </li>
  <li> Write an equation of the form of \(y=a\cdot b^x\) to represent a quantity \(a\) that changes by a growth factor \(b\). </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Explain the connections between an equation and a graph that represents exponential growth. </li>
  <li> Write and interpret an equation that represents exponential growth. </li>
</ul>
