<p>\(H(t)\) is the percentage of homes in the United States that have a landline phone in year \(t\). \(C(t)\) is the percentage of homes with only a cell phone. Here are the graphs of \(H\) and \(C\).</p>

    <p>Each household either has a landline or has no landline and relies only on cell phones, so \(H(t)\) and \(C(t)\) calculate separate groups of people. As long as there are not rounding errors, \(H(t)\) and \(C(t)\) together can only be 100 percent, and it will be less if there are people with no phone service at all.

    <p>It appears to take a value a little less than 100, maybe close to 97. For example, the two graphs meet below the midway point (50). At the beginning and the end of the shown interval, they add up to a little less than 100 as well. The sum is not constant (the shapes of the two graphs are different) but does not vary much, so the percentage of people with no phone service is small for the entire period.</p>
