<p>In this lesson, you will continue to work with patterns but begin to see these relationships as quadratic functions and write equations to define them.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Recognize quadratic functions written in different ways. </li>
  <li> Use information from a pattern of shapes to write a quadratic function. </li>
  <li> Know that, in a pattern of shapes, the step number is the input and the number of squares is the output. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 7.3.1: Quadratic Expressions and Area </li>
  <li> 7.3.2: Writing Equations for Patterns with Squares </li>
