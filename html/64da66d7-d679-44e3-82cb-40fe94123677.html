<h4>Matching Quadratic Functions and Their Graphs</h4>
<p>Below is a quadratic function represented in standard form, factored form, and with a graph.</p>
<p>Standard Form: \(f(x)=x^2+2x-8\)<br/>
  Factored Form: \(f(x) = (x + 4)(x - 2)\) </p>
<p><img alt="A parabola on a coordinate grid. The x-axis scale is 1 and extends from negative 10 to 10. The y-axis scale is 1 and extends from negative 14 to 6." height="302" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/337840b5d9ad8ca8808c7a428009e9f710edb0dc" width="300"/></p>
<p>Notice the factored form helps find the zeros: \(x = -4\) and \(x = 2\).</p>
<p>The factored form gives the zeros since the zeros (\(x\)-intercepts) are located where each factor equals 0.</p>
<p>The standard form, \(f(x)=x^2+2x-8\), helps give the \(y\)-intercept. The \(y\)-intercept occurs when \(x = 0\). Here, \(f(0) = -8\). On the graph, the \(y\)-intercept is \((0, -8)\).</p>

<p>Here is how to find the intercepts with the information provided: </p>
<p>The graph and the factored form help give the \(x\)-intercepts. They occur where the factors of the factored form equal 0, at \(x = -2\) and \(x = 3\). On the graph, these are where the graph crosses the \(x\)-axis, at the points \((-2, 0)\) and \((3, 0)\).</p>
<p>The \(y\)-intercept can be found with standard form when \(x=0\) in \(f(x)=x^2-x-6\). So \(y = -6\). <br/>
    Notice on the graph, the \(y\)-intercept, where the graph crosses the \(y\)-axis, is at \((0, -6)\).</p>
