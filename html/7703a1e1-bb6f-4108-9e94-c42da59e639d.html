<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Describe how a pattern is growing. </li>
  <li> Tell whether a pattern is growing linearly, exponentially, or quadratically. </li>
  <li> Explain that an expression with a squared term is called quadratic. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the<strong> activities </strong>that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 7.2.1: Squares in a Geometric Pattern </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you explored how different expressions can represent the same figure and still be equivalent. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 7.2.2: Constant and Exponential Change </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you wrote an expression to describe a pattern, and then you graphed the values of the step and the number of dots in each figure. One was linear, while the other was not. </li>
    <li> 7.2.2: Self Check </li>
    <li> 7.2.2: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 7.2.3: Quadratic Expressions </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you explored a quadratic relationship, including what makes it quadratic and not linear or exponential. </li>
    <li> 7.2.3: Self Check </li>
    <li> 7.2.3: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 7.2.4: Quadratic Relationships </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you examined three patterns and chose which one represents a quadratic relationship. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 7.2.5: Practice </li>
</ul>
