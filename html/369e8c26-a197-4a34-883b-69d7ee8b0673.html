<p>An exponential function is written in the form&nbsp;\(f(x)=ab^x\), where \(a\) is the initial value and \(b\) is the growth factor.</p>
<p>Here are some situations we have seen previously. For each situation:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li> Write a sentence of the form &ldquo;_____ is a function of _____.&rdquo;</li>
<li> Indicate which is the independent and which is the dependent variable. </li>
<li> Write an equation that represents the situation using function notation. </li>
</ol>
