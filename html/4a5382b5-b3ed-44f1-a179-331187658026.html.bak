<h4>Writing Expressions for Patterns</h4>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 1</p>
<p><img alt="A pattern of squares. Step 1 has 3 rows of squares. The top row has 1 square, the middle row has 3 squares, the bottom row has 1 square. They are shaped like a plus sign. Step 2 has 4 rows of squares. The top row has 1 square, the second row has 4 squares, the third row has 4 squares, the last row has 1 square. The squares in the top and bottom row are aligned above and below the second squares in rows 2 and 3, respectively. Step 3 has 5 rows. The top row has 1 square, row 2 has 5 squares, row 3 has 5 squares, row 4 has 5 squares, and the bottom row has 1 square. The squares in the top and bottom row are aligned above and below the second squares in rows 2 and 4, respectively." height="238" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/0a1a836e44bf7cd832a0d520642fc03dad9e66c3" width="550"/></p>
<p>Find the number of squares in Step 5:</p>
<p>First, look to see the pattern. Every step, another row and another column are added, plus the two extra squares.</p>
<ul>
<li> Step 1: 1 row of \(3 + 2\) </li>
<li> Step 2: 2 rows of \(4 +2\) </li>
<li> Step 3: 3 rows of \(5 + 2\) </li>
</ul>
<p>So the width is always 1 by \(n\), or \(n\). The length is \(n+2\), and then another 2 is added.</p>
<p>Then, draw pictures or create a table:</p>
<table class="os-raise-midsizetable">
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col">
        Step
</th>
<th scope="col">
        # of squares

<br/>
<p>At Step 5, there are 37 squares.</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 2</p>
<p>Find the expression for Step \(n\).</p>
<p>Multiply the length and width, and then add the 2 extra squares:</p>
<p>\(n(n+2)+2 = n^2+2n+n\)</p>

<p>Here is how to determine the number of squares in each step:</p>
<p>Notice that each figure adds a row and column, and then subtracts one square. The number of rows is always 2 more
    than the step number.</p>
<p>Begin by making a table:</p>
<table class="os-raise-midsizetable">
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col">
          Step
        </th>
<th scope="col">

<p>There are 48 squares in Step 5.</p>
<p>Step \(n\) would be found with \((n+2)(n+2)-1\) or \((n+2)^2-1\).</p>
