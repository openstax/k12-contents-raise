<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explain what it means for a value or pair of values to be a solution to an equation.</li>
  <li>Find solutions to equations by reasoning about a situation or by using algebra.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities </strong>that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1.4.1: Finding the Solution to an Equation in One Variable, Part 1&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you began to determine if a value was a solution to a given one-variable equation and identified what the solution could mean. For a value to be a solution to an equation, it must make the equation true.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1.4.2: Writing Equations to Represent Constraints<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you wrote equations from situations given the constraints of the problem.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1.4.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>
  <li>1.4.3: Finding the Solution to an Equation in Two Variables<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you were able to find the solution to an equation with two variables, given the solution to one of the variables.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1.4.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>
  <li>1.4.4: Finding the Solution to an Equation in One Variable, Part 2<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you worked to find multiple solutions to equations and identified what the solutions mean in this situation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
