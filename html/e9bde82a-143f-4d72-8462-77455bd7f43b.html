<p>In this project, students will apply their prior knowledge about plotting coordinate points, evaluating expressions using the correct order of operations, and simplifying algebraic expressions, to generate initial ideas about functions.</p> 

  <p>Students will first be asked to play with a simulation for a few minutes. This open play time allows students to learn how to use a simulation for learning, discover how they can interact with it, and feel ownership of their learning from the simulation. Following open play, students can share how to use the simulation, so every student is aware of the controls and how to interact.</p> 
  
  <p>When students are engaging with the activity sheet, they should be pausing to discuss some of their responses with a partner. The whole class discussions should produce a rich variety of thoughts and observations based on individual responses and partner discussions. </p>
  
<p>  By the end of the lesson, students should have completed the activity sheets using the simulation, and should be able to describe a function as having inputs, outputs, and behaving consistently. They should also be able to evaluate a function using different inputs, and be able to summarize the impact that certain operations have on the algebraic function, the table of values, the appearance of the graph, and the outputs. </p>

<h4>Project Activities</h4> 
<ol>
    <li>Simulating Relationships <strong>(10 minutes)</strong></li>
    <li>What is a Function? <strong>(15 minutes)</strong></li>
    <li>Different Kinds of Functions <strong>(20 minutes)</strong></li>
</ol>

<h3>Required Preparation</h3>
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/function-builder/latest/function-builder_en.html?screens=1,2,3" target="_blank">Preview the simulation</a> so that you are able to address questions regarding how to access the activities. </li>
