<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity takes quadratic regression a step further by using a data set that models a real-world situation. Students will model the data set representing the flight of a helium balloon by creating a scatter plot, find the equation of a curve of best fit, and use that equation to make predictions about the balloon&rsquo;s flight.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in pairs or groups, if necessary, so they have access to Desmos. If possible, allow students to work individually so that each understands the steps necessary to make predictions using a curve of best fit.</p>
<p>This activity starts from the beginning in Desmos, allowing students to create a table and then populate it with the data set representing the balloon&rsquo;s flight. Gauge students&rsquo; comfort with entering the data set and finding the curve of best fit. Review the steps as needed while allowing students to complete the first two questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pause the class and be sure that students have correctly entered the data and generated a curve of best fit before moving to question 3.</p>
<p>Allow students quiet time to think individually as they attempt question 3. Reinforce the idea that they can enter the equation \(x = 4\) into Desmos to help them solve the problem. After discussing the solution to question 3 as a class, allow students time to complete the remaining questions.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>A helium balloon is released and floats up before coming back down to the ground.</p>
<p>The following data set shows the height in feet, \(y\), of the balloon corresponding to the number of minutes passed, \(x\).</p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may assume that the data set models a symmetrical flight of the balloon from the ground up to a maximum height and back down to the ground. Show where the graph crosses the \(y\)-axis, or where time equals 0 minutes. Emphasize that at the start of this data set, or \(x = 0\), the balloon already had a height of approximately 78.6 feet.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>To review key ideas from the activity, discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> &ldquo;How does graphing an additional line on the coordinate plane help to visualize making a prediction using the curve of best fit?&rdquo; (The line that is being graphed represents a given \(x\)- or \(y\)-value in the situation. By finding its intersection point with the curve of best fit, the corresponding \(x\)- or \(y\)-value is determined.) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;In the activity, what does a vertical line with the equation \(x = 8\) represent?&rdquo; (It represents the moment in the balloon&rsquo;s flight when 8 minutes have passed.) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;In the activity, what does a vertical line with the equation \(y = 36\) represent?&rdquo; (It represents the moment or moments in the balloon&rsquo;s flight when it has a height of 36 feet.) </li>

<h4>Making Predictions Using a Quadratic Model</h4>
<p>A filtration system is being tested in a new aquarium. A pollutant is continuously added to the aquarium, and the filtration system is turned on until it has removed all of the pollutant from the water.</p>
<p>The following data set shows the milliliters (mL) of pollutant present, \(y\), corresponding to the number of minutes that have passed, \(x\), since the experiment started.</p>
<p><a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/1dea803e6bbfa6ecf97f6b685de81f9e25c9868d" target="_blank">Desmos: Aquarium Pollutant</a></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s enter the instruction line, \(y_1 \sim ax_1^2+bx_1+ c\), to find the curve of best fit.</p>
<p><img alt="A QUADRATIC REGRESSION THAT CLOSELY APPROXIMATES THE 6 PLOTTED POINTS. R-SQUARED IS APPROXIMATELY 0.99.

<p>The curve of best fit is determined to be \(y = -0.29x^2+ 37.74x + 95.95\).</p>
<p>We can use this curve of best fit to answer questions and make predictions about the amount of pollutant that will be in the water (mL) and the time it takes to completely clean the tank of pollutant.</p>
<p>How many mL of pollutant will be in the water after 12 minutes?</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> To answer this question, we want to know the \(y\)-value on the curve of best fit when the \(x\)-value is 12. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> We can graph the line \(x = 12\) and see where it intersects with the curve of best fit. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="A QUADRATIC REGRESSION THAT CLOSELY APPROXIMATES THE 6 PLOTTED POINTS. R-SQUARED IS APPROXIMATELY 0.99.

A VERTICAL LINE IS DRAWN THROUGH X EQUALS 12, WITH THE POINT (12, 507.492) LABELED." height="296" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c0cf9e0de60c8680edd67e2edee49e7ef614fe35" width="624"></p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> By moving the cursor over the intersection point, we see that the \(y\)-value is approximately 507.49. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> This means that after 12 minutes, there will be approximately 507.49 mL of pollutant in the water. </li>
</ul>
<p>At what time(s) will there be 1000 mL of pollutant in the water?</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> To answer this question, we want to know the \(x\)-value on the curve of best fit when the \(y\)-value is 1000. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> We can graph the line \(y = 1000\) and see where it intersects with the curve of best fit. </li>
</ul>

<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> The line \(y = 1000\) intersects with the curve of best fit at two points. This means there are two times when there is 1000 mL of pollutant. We see that the \(x\)-values are approximately 31.51 and 99.91. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> In other words, there will be 1000 mL of pollutant at approximately 31.51 minutes and again at approximately 99.91 minutes after the experiment starts. </li>
</ul>
<p>How long after the experiment has started will the filtration system have removed all of the pollutant from the aquarium?</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> To answer this question, we want to know the \(x\)-value of the \(x\)-intercept of the curve of best fit. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> If we graph \(y = 0\), we can click on the intersection point to find its coordinates. The \(x\)-intercept of the curve of best fit is \((133.92, 0)\). </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> So, approximately 133.92 minutes after the experiment starts, there will be no pollutant left in the water. </li>
</ul>
<h4> Try It: Making Predictions Using a Quadratic Model </h4>

<p>The data set shows the milliliters (mL) of pollutant present, \(y\), corresponding to the number of minutes that have passed, \(x\), since the experiment started.</p>

  <li>How many mL of pollutant will be in the water after 47 minutes?</li>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Here is how to use graphing technology and the curve of best fit to make predictions about a situation:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>After 47 minutes, there will be approximately 1235.41 mL of pollutant.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>There will be 1215 mL of pollutant in the water after approximately 45.19 minutes and 86.23 minutes.</li>
