<h4>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h4>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>For numbers 1â€“3, consider the equation \(1.5x + 4.5y = 18\).</p>
<p>Consider the equation \( 1.5x + 4.5y = 18 \). For each questionexplain your reasoning.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>If we graph the equation, what is the slope of the graph? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The slope is \( -\frac13 \). Rearranging the equation to isolate \( y \) gives \( y=- \frac13 x+4 \).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Where does the graph intersect the \( y \)-axis?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The graph intersects the \( y \)-axis at \( (0,4) \). The 4 in \( y=- \frac13 x+4 \) tells us where the graph crosses the \( y \)-axis. </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Where does it intersect the \( x \)-axis?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The graph intersects the \( x \)-axis at \( (12,0) \). Substituting 0 for \( y \) in the original equation and solving for \( x \) gives \( x=12 \).</p>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p> Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down in 1.12 and 1.13, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
