<h4>Finding a Quadratic Function from Its Zeros</h4>
<p>Given the zeros of a quadratic function, we can write it in standard form.</p>
<p>Let's look at an example.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Write a function, \(h(x)\), that has the zeros 5 and &ndash;3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that if the zeros are 5 and &ndash;3, then the factor equations that were solved are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;\(x &minus; 5 = 0\) &nbsp; &nbsp; and&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(x + 3 = 0\).</p>
<p>When these equations are solved, they provide the zeros 5 and &ndash;3.</p>
<p>We can use these equations to write the function in factored form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\(h(x) = (x &minus; 5)(x + 3)\)</p>
<p>By using the distributive property, or FOIL, we can find the standard form of the function.</p>
<p>\(h(x) = x^2 &minus; 2x &minus; 15\)</p>
<p>Recall that sometimes a function might have only one zero.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Write a function, \(d(x)\), that has one zero at 8.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From previous lessons, we know that when the factor equations were identical, there was only one zero.</p>
<p>\(x &minus; 8 = 0\) &nbsp; &nbsp; and&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(x &minus; 8 = 0\)</p>
<p>The factored form of this equation is \(d(x) = (x &minus; 8)(x &minus; 8)\).</p>
<p>After using the distributive property, or FOIL, the standard form of the function is \(d(x) = x^2 &minus; 16x + 64\).</p>
<p>Finding the zeros from a graph follows the same process.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>
<p>Write a function, \(z(x)\), that corresponds to the graph shown.</p>

<p>The zeros of the graph are &ndash;4 and &ndash;1. The resulting factor equations are:</p>
<p>\(x + 4 = 0\) &nbsp; &nbsp; and&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(x + 1 = 0\).</p>
<p>The factored form of this equation is \(z(x) = (x + 4)(x + 1)\).</p>
<p>After using FOIL, the standard form of the function is \(z(x) = x^2 + 5x + 4\).</p>
