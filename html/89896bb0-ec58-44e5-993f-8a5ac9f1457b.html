<p>The focus of the lesson is methods for writing equations of a line. The method you use is based on the information you are given.</p>
<p>The table can be used as a reference to write the equation of a line, based on the information given.</p>

<p>Encourage students to check their equations by using a graphing calculator or Desmos. Tell students to look at the graph to make sure it goes through the given points.</p>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
