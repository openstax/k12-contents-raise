<p>In this lesson, you will deepen your understanding of the solutions to linear inequalities by studying them in context. You will write inequalities in two variables to represent constraints, and interpret the points on a boundary line and on either side of it in terms of the situation.</p>
<p>Below are the knowledge and skills you will practice in this lesson. Before you begin, read each one and rate how much you currently know about each one. It&rsquo;s okay if your ratings are low; the purpose of this is to check in with yourself about what you do or do not yet know.</p>
<p><strong>Can you...</strong></p>
