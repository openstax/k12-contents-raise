<p dir="ltr">In this lesson, you will take a closer look at whether points on the boundary lines of the system&rsquo;s solution region are included in the solutions. Analyzing graphs and communicating observations about them will require your attention to precision. You will also apply your insights to solve more challenging contextual problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Below are the knowledge and skills you will practice in this lesson. Before you begin, read each one and rate how much you currently know about each one. It&rsquo;s okay if your ratings are low; the purpose of this is to check in with yourself about what you do or do not yet know.</p>
<p><strong>Can you...</strong></p>
