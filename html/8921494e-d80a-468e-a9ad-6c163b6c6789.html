<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm-up familiarizes students with a new way of using function notation and gives them a preview of the work in this lesson.</p>
<p>The prompt also gives students opportunities to see and make use of structure. The specific structure they might notice is how the values in the \(f(x)\) and the \(g(x)\) columns in each table correspond to the expression describing each function.</p>
<p>When students articulate what they notice and wonder, they have an opportunity to attend to precision in the language they use to describe what they see. They might first use less formal or imprecise language, and then restate their observation with more precise language to communicate more clearly.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Display the tables for all to see. Tell students that their job is to think of at least one thing they notice and at least one thing they wonder. Give students 1 minute of quiet time to think individually, and then 1 minute to discuss the things they notice with their partner, followed by a whole-class discussion.</p>

<h4>Student Response</h4>
<p>Students may notice:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The tables don't say &ldquo;input&rdquo; and &ldquo;output.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>While there is a column labeled \(x\), there is not a column labeled \(y\).</li>
  <li>One function is called \(f\). The other is called \(g\).</li>
  <li>There&rsquo;s an expression (rather than a number) on the right side of the equation \(f(x)=10&minus;2x\) and \(g(x)=x^3\).</li>
  <li>If we substitute the values in the left column for the \(x\) in the expression, we get the values in the right column.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students may wonder:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why is there \(x\) on the right side of the equal sign?</li>
  <li>Are there rules about how to name functions?</li>
  <li>What does each equation, \(f(x)=10&minus;2x\) and \(g(x)=x^3\), mean?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Ask students to share the things they noticed and wondered. Record and display their responses for all to see. If possible, record the relevant reasoning on or near the tables. After all responses have been recorded without commentary or editing, ask students, &ldquo;Is there anything on this list that you are wondering about?&rdquo; Encourage students to respectfully disagree, ask for clarification, or point out contradicting information.</p>
