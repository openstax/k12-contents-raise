<p>Some key takeaways from this lesson are the ideas that real-life situations often vary directly. Direct variation problems use a constant of variation. They can be used not only to find the output, but also the input.</p>
<p>To help students see these points, discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Could you use direct variation equations if you had the output and had to find the input?</li>
  <li>For example 1, how many minutes would Raoul have to use the treadmill to burn 500 calories?</li>
  <li>For example 2, how many minutes would Arnold have exercise to burn 500 calories?</li>
  <li>For example 3, how long would it take the train to go 800 miles?</li>
</ul>
<p>Tell students that equations are mathematical models. A model is a mathematical representation of a real-life situation. When people create models, they rely on the information they have, but they also make assumptions and decisions that affect the models. If the information or assumptions change, the model would also change.</p>
<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the day's learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
