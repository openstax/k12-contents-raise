  <p><em>Writing, Listening, Conversing: MLR1 Stronger and Clearer Each Time.</em> Use this routine to help students improve their written explanations for each step in the derivation of the quadratic formula. Give students time to meet with two to three partners to share and get feedback on their responses. Display feedback prompts that will help students strengthen their ideas and clarify their language. For example, “How do you know . . . ?”, “Why do you think . . . ?”, “What happened between _____ and _____?”, and “Is it always true that . . . ?” Invite students to go back and revise or refine their written explanation based on the feedback from peers. This will help students understand how completing the square leads to the quadratic formula through communicating their reasoning with a partner.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here is one solution for solving \(x^2+3x+8=0\) by completing the square, where each step is shown, but numerical expressions are not evaluated.</p>
<p>Original equation<br>
  \(x^2+3x+8=0\)</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  \(x^2+3x=-8\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  \(4x^2+4(3x)=4(-8)\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  \((2x)^2+6(2x)=-32\)</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  \(P^2+6P=-32\)</p>
<p>Step 5<br>
  \(P^2+6P+3^2=-32+3^2\)</p>
<p>Step 6<br>
  \((P+3)^2=3^2-32\)</p>
<p>Step 7<br>
  \(P+3= \pm \sqrt{3^2-32}\)</p>
<p>Step 8<br>
  \(P=-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2-32}\)</p>
<p>Step 9<br>
  \(2x=-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2-32}\)</p>
<p>Step 10<br>
  \(x= \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2-32}}{2}\)</p>

  <li>In Step 2, the equation is multiplied by 4. Why might that be?</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> To make the coefficient of \(x^2\) a perfect square and the coefficient of \(x\) an even number</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>In Step 5, \(3^2\) is added to each side. Why might that be?</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(3^2\) completes the square for the expression on the left side. To keep the two sides equal, it needs to be added to the other side as well.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>What happened between Step 5 and Step 6?</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The perfect square is rewritten in factored form, and \(-32+3^2\) is rewritten as \(3^2-32\).</p>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>Points to Emphasize</h5>
<p>If students struggle with completing the square, have them revisit the Additional Resources in 9.1&ndash;9.3. If students struggle with recognizing the quadratic formula, have them revisit the Additional Resources in 9.6 and 9.7.</p>
