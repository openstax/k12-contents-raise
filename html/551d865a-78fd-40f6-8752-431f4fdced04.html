<p>Here is one solution for solving \(x^2+3x+8=0\) by completing the square, where each step is shown, but numerical expressions are not evaluated.</p>
<p>Original equation<br>
  \(x^2+3x+8=0\)</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  \(x^2+3x=-8\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  \(4x^2+4(3x)=4(-8)\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  \((2x)^2+6(2x)=-32\)</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  \(P^2+6P=-32\)</p>
<p>Step 5<br>
  \(P^2+6P+3^2=-32+3^2\)</p>
<p>Step 6<br>
  \((P+3)^2=3^2-32\)</p>
<p>Step 7<br>
  \(P+3= \pm \sqrt{3^2-32}\)</p>
<p>Step 8<br>
  \(P=-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2-32}\)</p>
<p>Step 9<br>
  \(2x=-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2-32}\)</p>
<p>Step 10<br>
  \(x= \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2-32}}{2}\)</p>

<li>In Step 2, the equation is multiplied by 4. Why might that be?</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> To make the coefficient of \(x^2\) a perfect square and the coefficient of \(x\) an even number</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li>In Step 5, \(3^2\) is added to each side. Why might that be?</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(3^2\) completes the square for the expression on the left side. To keep the two sides equal, it needs to be added to the other side as well.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
<li>What happened between Step 5 and Step 6?</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The perfect square is rewritten in factored form, and \(-32+3^2\) is rewritten as \(3^2-32\).</p>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>Points to Emphasize</h5>
<p>If students struggle with completing the square, have them revisit the Additional Resources in 9.1&ndash;9.3. If students struggle with recognizing the quadratic formula, have them revisit the Additional Resources in 9.6 and 9.7.</p>
