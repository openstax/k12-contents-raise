<p>Keep students in groups of 2. Display the graph and the descriptions of two functions for all students to see:</p>
<p><img alt="Nonlinear graph. time in seconds and distance in feet." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/e7e7a94e312740190f01faed7478bbfa05d373dc"></p>
<ul>
  <li>Function \(b\) gives the vertical distance (or the height) of a bee from the ground as a function of time, \(t\).</li>
  <li>Function \(d\) gives the distance of a child from where his mom is sitting as a function of time, \(t\).</li>
</ul>
<p>Tell students that the outputs of both functions are measured in feet and the inputs are both measured in seconds.</p>
<p>Ask partners to choose a function. For that function, they should take turns identifying the following features on the graph and interpreting them in terms of the situation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>vertical intercept</li>
  <li>horizontal intercept</li>
  <li>maximum</li>
  <li>minimum</li>
  <li>intervals where the function is increasing</li>
  <li>intervals where the function is decreasing</li>
  <li>intervals where the function is staying constant</li>
  <li>solution or solutions to \(b(t)=3.5\) or \(d(t)=3.5\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;How can you tell that a point on the graph is a maximum, a minimum, or neither?&rdquo; (Look around it, left and right, to see whether the given point is higher than all the other points, lower than all the others, or neither.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How many intercepts can the graph of a function have?&rdquo; (An unlimited number on the horizontal axis, but only one on the vertical axis.)</li>
</ul>
