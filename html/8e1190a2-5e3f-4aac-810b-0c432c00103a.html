<h3>Narrative</h3>
<p>In this culminating project, you will integrate ideas from the unit. In the first activity, you will  analyze points on a graph to identify your meaning in context. In the second activity, you will identify slopes and intercepts from graphs and match equations to graphs. Finally, you will create your own scenarios to match a linear equation.</p>
<br>
<p>When you finish this project, you will have demonstrated how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Identify slopes and intercepts from a graph.
  </li>
  <li>Identify an equation that matches a graph. 
  </li>
  <li>Create a real-world scenario from a graph.
  </li>
</ul>
