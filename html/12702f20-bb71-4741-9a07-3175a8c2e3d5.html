<h2>Activity (15 minutes)</h2>
<div>
<p>In the previous
        activity, students recalled what it means for a number to be a solution
        to an equation in one variable. In this activity, they review the
        meaning of a solution to an equation in two variables. </p>
</div>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<div>
<p>Arrange students
        in groups of 2&ndash;3. Without giving away the equation, present the
        scenario and ask students whether they are familiar with this kind of
        situation. Then encourage students to use Desmos to model the scenario
        with an equation.</p>
<p>As students
        work, quietly ask one or two students if they would be willing to share
        their reasoning with the class. After they share out, discuss why the
        values in problems 1a and 1c do not satisfy the equation (or appear on
        the graph).</p>
</div>
<h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>
<div>
<p>One gram of protein contains 4 calories. One gram of fat contains 9 calories. A snack has 60 calories from <span>\( p \)</span> grams of protein and <span>\( f \)</span> grams of fat.</p>
<p>The equation <span>\( 4p+9f = 60 \)</span> represents the relationship between these quantities. </p>
<ol>
<li>
            Determine
            if each pair of values could be the number of grams of protein and fat
            in the snack. Be prepared to explain your reasoning.
            <ol>
<li>5 grams of protein and 2 grams of fat
                </li>
<li>10.5 grams of protein and 2 grams of fat
                </li>
<li>8 grams of protein and 4 grams of fat
                </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If there are 6 grams of fat in the snack, how many grams of protein are there? Show your reasoning.
        </li>
<li>In this situation, what does a solution to the equation <span>\( 4p+9f = 60 \)</span> tell us? Give an example of a solution.
        </li>
</ol>

<h3><span>Student Response</span></h3>

<ol>
<li>Answers:<ol>
<li><span>No</span></li>
<li><span>Yes&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>No</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>1.5 grams. Sample reasoning: <span>\( 4p + 9(6) = 60 \)</span>, so <span>\( p \)</span> must be 1.5 for the equation to be true.</li>
<li>Sample
            response: It means a pair of grams of protein and fat in the snack that
            add up to 60 calories. An example: 6 grams of protein and 4 grams of
            fat.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
</div>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<div>
<p>The goal of the discussion is to make sure students
        understand that a solution to an equation in two variables is any pair
        of values that, when substituted into the equation and evaluated, make
        the equation true. Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;In this situation, what does it mean when we say that \( p=12 \) and \( f=1.5 \) are <em>not</em>
            solutions to the equation?&rdquo; (They are not a combination of protein and
            fat that would produce 60 calories. Substituting them for the variables
            in the equation leads to a false equation of \( 61.5=60 \).) </li>
<li>&ldquo;How did you find out the grams of protein in
            the snack given that there are 6 grams of fat?&rdquo; (Substitute 6 for \( f \) and solve the equation.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Can you find another combination that is a solution?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;How many possible combinations of grams of
            protein and fat (or \( p \) and \( f \)) would add up to 60 calories?&rdquo;
            (many solutions) </li>
</ul>
<p>As a segue to the next lesson, solicit some ideas on
        how we know that there are many solutions to the equation. If no one
        mentions using a graph, bring it up and tell students that they will
        explore the graphs of two-variable equations next.</p>

<h3><span id="docs-internal-guid-7c0b41cc-7fff-8cc3-1090-5f1740fa6361">Solutions to Equations in Two Variables</span></h3>
<p id="fs-id1168345252532">An equation that contains two unknown
            quantities or two quantities that vary is called an equation in two
            variables. A solution to such an equation is a pair of numbers that
            makes the equation true.</p>
<p id="fs-id1168345252532">Suppose Tyler spends $45 on T-shirts and
            socks. A T-shirt costs $10, and a pair of socks costs $2.50. If&nbsp;\( ùë° \)
            represents the number of T-shirts and&nbsp;\( ùëù \) represents the number of
            pairs of socks that Tyler buys, we can can represent this situation
            with the equation:</p>
<p id="fs-id1168345252532">\( 10t+2.50p=45 \)<br></p>
<p id="fs-id1168345252532">This is an equation in two variables. More than one pair of values for \( t \) and \( p \) make the equation true.</p>
<p id="fs-id1168345252532">\(&nbsp;t=3&nbsp;\) and \(&nbsp;p=6&nbsp;\)<br>\(&nbsp;10(3)+2.50(6)=45&nbsp;\)<br>\(&nbsp;30+15=45&nbsp;\)<br>\(&nbsp;45=45&nbsp;\)</p>
<p id="fs-id1168345252532">\(&nbsp;t=4&nbsp;\) and \(&nbsp;p=2&nbsp;\)<br>\(&nbsp;10(4)+2.50(2)=45&nbsp;\)<br>\(&nbsp;40+5=45&nbsp;\)<br>\(&nbsp;45=45&nbsp;\)</p>
<p id="fs-id1168345252532">\(&nbsp;t=2&nbsp;\) and \(&nbsp;p=10&nbsp;\)<br>\(&nbsp;10(2)+2.50(10)=45&nbsp;\)<br>\(&nbsp;20+25=45&nbsp;\)<br>\(&nbsp;45=45&nbsp;\)</p>
<p id="fs-id1168345252532">In this situation, one constraint is that
            the combined cost of shirts and socks must equal $45. Solutions to the
            equation are pairs of \(&nbsp;t&nbsp;\) and \(&nbsp;p&nbsp;\) values that satisfy this
            constraint.</p>
<p id="fs-id1168345252532">Combinations such as \(&nbsp;t=1&nbsp;\) and
            \(&nbsp;p=10&nbsp;\) or \(&nbsp;t=2&nbsp;\) and \(&nbsp;p=7&nbsp;\) are not solutions because they
            don&rsquo;t meet the constraint. When these pairs of values are substituted
            into the equation, they result in statements that are false.</p>
