<p>After a flashlight is turned on, it gets brighter as it warms up, and then it grows dimmer as the battery dies. The equation modeling the brightness it emits, in lumens, \(h\) hours after being turned on is shown here.</p>
<p>\(f(h) = -8h^2 + 30h + 50\)</p>
<p>Which equation would you solve to determine when the flashlight dies and stops emitting lumens?</p><br>
