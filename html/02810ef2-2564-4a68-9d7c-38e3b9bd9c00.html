<h3>Solutions to Inequalities in One Variable<br></h3>
<p>In this lesson, students revisit the meaning of the solutions to an inequality in one variable and recall that the solution set is a range of values. They also investigate different ways to find the solution set to an inequality&mdash;by reasoning about the quantities and relationships in context; by guessing some values, substituting them into the inequality, and checking them to see if they make the inequality true; and by first solving a related equation in one variable. Along the way, students reason abstractly and quantitatively.</p>
<p>Emphasize that a number line showing a solution set to an inequality is a simple, straightforward way to visualize that solution set. Solving an inequality representing a real-world situation and displaying the solution set on a number line creates a useful tool to display the constraints of that situation.</p>
<p>Two optional activities are included in this lesson. The first is to give students an additional opportunity to make sense of the solutions to an inequality in terms of a situation. The second optional activity introduces them to graphing two-variable equations as a way to find solutions to one-variable inequalities.</p>
<p>Later, students will use the understanding they build here to solve more sophisticated problems and to find solutions to linear inequalities in two variables.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Find the solution to a one-variable inequality by reasoning and by solving a related equation and testing values greater than and less than that solution.</li>
<li>Graph the solution to an inequality as a ray on a number line and interpret the solution in context.</li>
<li>Explain that the solution to an inequality is a range of values that make the inequality true.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
