<h3>Activity (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students will use what they have learned about the square root property to reason the solutions to more complex quadratic equations.</p>
<p>The variable being squared is now an expression being squared, but the principles used to solve the equation remain the same. Students will use the square root property to identify two different solutions.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Read the activity opening together as a class. Ask students why solving the new equation might be more complex. (The variable being squared is now an expression being squared.)</p>
<p>As a hint for the first exercise, tell students to take the square root of both sides as previously done. This gives \( \pm \sqrt{144}=(n+1)\).</p>
<p>Students might then reason:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Some number plus 1 equals the positive square root of 144. </li>
  <li> Some number plus 1 equals the negative square root of 144. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p> Solving an equation of the form \(a(x&minus;h)^2=k\) is a similar process to the equations we have previously solved.</p>
<p>Notice that the quadratic term, \(x\), in the original form \(ax^2= k\) is replaced with \((x&minus;h)\).</p>

<p>Once the binomial is isolated, the square root property can be used. You can reason the solution by taking the square root and then appropriately isolating the variable using the two different square roots.</p>
<p>Solve the following quadratic equations. Explain or show your reasoning.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>\(144=(n+1)^2\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(n=11\) and \(n=-13\)</p>
<p>Because 12 and &minus;12 are the two numbers we can square to make 144 and \(n+1\) is the number being squared, we need \(n\) to be 1 less than 12 or &minus;12. So \(n=11\) and \(n=-13\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>\((u&minus;6)^2= 64\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(u=14\) and \(u=-2\)</p>
<p>Since 8 and &minus;8 are the two numbers we can square to make 64 and \(u&minus;6\) is the number being squared, we need \(u\) to be 6 more than 8 or &minus;8. So \(u=14\) and \(u=-2\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>\((n&minus;5)^2&minus;30=70\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(n=15\) and \(n=-5\)</p>
<p>To isolate the binomial, add 30 to both sides of the equation. Since 10 and &ndash;10 are the two numbers we can square to make 100 and \(n-5\) is the number being squared, we need \(n\) to be 5 more than 10 or &ndash;10. So \(n=15\) and \(n=-5\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>\(4(x+6)^2&minus;5=31\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>\(x=-3\) and \(x=-9\)</p>
<p>To begin isolating the binomial, add 5 to both sides of the equation. Then divide both sides of the equation by 4. Since 3 and &ndash;3 are the two numbers we can square to make 9 and \(x+6\) is the number being squared, we need \(x\) to be 6 less than 3 or &ndash;3. So \(x=-3\) and \(x=-9\).</p>
<h4>Student-Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>Solve the following quadratic equation. Explain your reasoning.</p>
<p>\((4x&minus;3)^2+11=47\)</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Two solutions: \(x=\frac{9}{4}\) and \(x=&minus;\frac{3}{4}\).</p>
<p>To isolate the binomial, subtract 11 from both sides of the equation. This leaves \((4x &minus; 3)^2= 36\). When you take the square root of both sides, you end up with \(4x&minus;3= \pm 6\). This leaves two equations to solve:</p>
<p>\(4x&minus;3=6\;\;\;\;\;\;\;4x&minus;3=&minus;6\)</p>
<p>By solving each of them, you find the solutions \(x=\frac{9}{4}\) and \(x=&minus;\frac34\).</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>This activity demonstrates a different way to use the square root property to solve a more complex equation.</p>
<p>After completing the activity, ask students to rewrite the square root property using the following starting expression:</p>
<p>If \((x+1)^2=k\), then ____________.</p>
<p>After some discussion, reveal the answer to be:</p>
<p>\(x+1=\sqrt{k} \quad \text { and } \quad x+1=-\sqrt{k} \rightarrow x=-1\pm \sqrt{k}\)</p>

<h4>Solving Quadratic Equations of the Form \(a(x - h)^2 = k\)</h4>
<p>We can use the square root property to solve an equation of the form \(a(x-h)^2=k\) as well.</p>
<p>Notice that the quadratic term, \(x\), in the original form \(ax^2=k\) is replaced with \((x&minus;h)\).</p>
<p>\(a {\style{color:red}x}^{2}=k \quad a{\style{color:red}(}{\style{color:red}x}\;{\style{color:red}-}\;{\style{color:red}h}{\style{color:red})}^{2}=k\)</p>
<p>Like before, the first step is to isolate the term that has the variable squared. In this case, a binomial is being squared.</p>
<p>Once the binomial is isolated, by dividing each side by the coefficient of \(a\), the square root property can be used on \((x&minus;h)^2\).</p>
<p>Solve \(4(y&minus;7)^2=48\).</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Isolate the quadratic term and make its coefficient 1. So, divide both sides of the equation by 4.</p>
<p>\(4(y&minus;7)^2=48\)<br>
  \((y&minus;7)^2=12\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Use the square root property on the binomial.<br>
  \(y&minus;7= \pm \sqrt{12}\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Simplify the radical by pulling out the factors that are perfect squares.<br>
  Solve for \(y\). Rewrite the two solutions.</p>
<p>\(y&minus;7= \pm \sqrt{12}\)<br>
  \(y&minus;7= \pm \sqrt{4 \cdot 3}\)<br>
  \(y&minus;7= \pm 2 \sqrt{3}\)<br>
  \(y =7 \pm 2 \sqrt{3}\)<br>
  \(y =7+2 \sqrt{3}\), \(y=7&minus;2 \sqrt{3}\) </p>
<p>Step 4 <br>
  Check the solutions.</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rrr} 4(y-7)^{2}=48 &amp; 4(y-7)^{2}=48 \\ 4({\style{color:red}7}\;{\style{color:red}+}\;{\style{color:red}2} \sqrt{{\style{color:red}3}}-7)^{2} \stackrel{?}{=} 48 &amp; 4({\style{color:red}7}\;{\style{color:red}-}\;{\style{color:red}2} \sqrt{{\style{color:red}3}}-7)^{2} \stackrel{?}{=} 48 \\ 4(2 \sqrt{3})^{2} \stackrel{?}{=} 48 &amp; 4(-2 \sqrt{3})^{2} \stackrel{?}{=} 48 \\ 4(12)^{2} \stackrel{?}{=} 48 &amp; 4(12)^{2} \stackrel{?}{=} 48 \\ 48=48 {\style{color:red}\checkmark} &amp; 48=48 {\style{color:red}\checkmark} \end{array} \)</p>
