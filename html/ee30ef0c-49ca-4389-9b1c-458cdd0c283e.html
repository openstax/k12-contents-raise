<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity introduces the use of the \(\pm\) notation as a simple way to express the two square roots of a number. Students solve several simple equations by finding square roots and express their solutions using the notation.</p>
<p>Students also see that sometimes the solutions are not rational numbers and can be expressed exactly using the radical notation rather than using their decimal approximations. For example, the solutions to \(x^2=24\) can be written as \(x= \pm \sqrt{24}\) rather than \(x \approx \pm 4.9\) and the solutions to \((x-3)^2=24\) can be written as \(x= \pm \sqrt{24}+3\) instead of \(x \approx \pm 4.9+3\).</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Remind students that we have seen that some quadratic equations have two solutions. Take the equation \(x^2=25\), for example. For the equation to be true, \(x\) can be 5 and -5 because \(5^2=25\) and \((-5)^2=25\). We have been writing the solutions as: \(x=5\) and \(x=-5\). Explain that a shorter way to convey the same information is by writing \(x= \pm 5\).</p>

      <p>Before students share their solutions, present an incorrect solution and explanation for the equation x²=18 . For example, “The solutions are 9 and -9. I took the square root of each side and divided by 2. Since we are doing square roots, I made sure to put a positive and negative solution.” Ask students to identify the error, critique the reasoning, and write a correct explanation. As students discuss with a partner, monitor for students who clarify the meaning of square root by using a simpler example. Highlight explanations that verify the solution by multiplying the same number by itself. This helps students evaluate, and improve upon, the written mathematical arguments of others, as they solidify their understanding of square root.</p>

<br>
<p>So far in this activity you encountered radical solutions that were easy to simplify. Sometimes you will get radical solutions like 
\(\sqrt{12}\). Let&rsquo;s review how to simplify more difficult radicals using perfect squares. </p>
<p><strong>Step 1 - </strong>Look at the ways to factor the number under the radical. </p>
<p>For example, factor 12 from \(\sqrt{12}\).</p>
<p>\(12=6*2\) and<br>
\(12=4*3\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Choose the factorization of the number that includes a perfect square. Rewrite the number under the radical using that factorization.</p>
<p>\(\sqrt{12}\) =\(\sqrt{4*3}\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 - </strong>Recall that \(\sqrt{a*b}=\sqrt{a}*\sqrt{b}\).</p>
<p>\(\sqrt{4*3}=\sqrt4*\sqrt3\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 - </strong>Simplify the perfect squares.</p>
<p>\(\sqrt4*\sqrt3 =2\sqrt3\)</p>
<p>So \(\sqrt{12} = 2\sqrt3\)</p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>When using \(\pm\) the notation for the first time, some students may struggle to remember that it shows a number and its opposite. Encourage those students to continue writing their answers both ways in this lesson to reinforce the meaning of the new notation. Show students how both solutions work in the original equation by checking the answers.</p>
<p>Some students may still struggle to understand the meaning of the square root. Watch for students who evaluate a square root by dividing by 2. Ask these students what the square root of 9 is. If this does not convince students that dividing by two is the incorrect operation, demonstrate that we call 3 a square root of 9 because \(3 \cdot 3=9\).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their solutions. Record and display the solutions for all to see. Discuss any disagreements, if there are any.</p>
<p>Draw students' attention to the last three sets of solutions, which are irrational. Ask students to recall the meaning of rational numbers and irrational numbers. Remind students that a rational number is a fraction or its opposite, for example: 12, -7, \(\frac18\), \(-\frac18\), 90.38, or 0.005. Irrational numbers are numbers that are not rational, for example: \(\sqrt{2}\), \(\pi\), and \(\sqrt{10}\). (Students will have more opportunities to review and classify rational and irrational numbers later in the unit, so for now, it suffices that they remember that an irrational number is a number that is not rational.)</p>
<p>Highlight that when the solution is irrational, the most concise way to write an exact solution is, for example, \(x= \pm \sqrt{18}-1\). Writing this in decimal form only allows us to write an approximate solution. For example, in this case, 3.24 and -5.24 are approximate solutions.</p>
<p>Then, display the variations in writing the solutions to \((x+1)^2=18\) for all to see. Discuss how they are all different ways of writing the same two solutions.</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> \(x= \pm \sqrt{18}-1\) </li>
  <li> \(x= \sqrt{18}-1\) and \(x=- \sqrt{18}-1\) </li>
  <li> \(x=-1 \pm \sqrt{18}\) </li>
  <li> \(x=-1+ \sqrt{18}\) and \(x=-1- \sqrt{18}\) </li>
</ul>
<p>Students will likely need review on simplifying radicals. Highlight that simplifying a radical does not mean that it is rational. So \(\sqrt{18}\) is irrational and so is \(3 \sqrt{2}\).</p>

<h4>Solving Quadratics with Radical Solutions</h4>
<p>When solving quadratic equations, it is important to remember that:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Any positive number has two square roots, one positive and one negative, because there are two numbers that can be squared to make that number. (For example, \(6^2 \)and \((-6)^2\) both equal 36, so 6 and -6 are both square roots of 36.) </li>
  <li> The square root symbol \((\sqrt{\;\;})\) can be used to express the positive square root of a number. For example, the square root of 36 is 6, but it can also be written as \(\sqrt{36}\) because \(\sqrt{36} \cdot \sqrt{36}=36\). </li>
  <li> To express the negative square root of a number, say 36, we can write -6 or \(-\sqrt{36}\). </li>
  <li> When a number is not a perfect square, for example, 40, we can express its square roots by writing 40 and \(-\sqrt{40}\). </li>
</ul>
<p>How could we write the solutions to an equation like \((x+4)^2=11\)? This equation is saying, &ldquo;something squared is 11.&rdquo; To make the equation true, that something must be \(\sqrt{11}\) or \(-\sqrt{11}\).</p>
<p>We can write:</p>
<p>\(x+4= \sqrt{11}\) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \(x+4= - \sqrt{11}\)</p>
<p>\(x=-4+ \sqrt{11}\) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \(x=-4+- \sqrt{11}\) </p>
<p>A more compact way to write the two solutions to the equation is: \(x=-4 \pm \sqrt{11}\).</p>
<h4>Try It: Solving Quadratics with Radical Solutions</h4>
