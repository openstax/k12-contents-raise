<h4>Finding a Quadratic Function from Its Zeros and a Point</h4>
<p>Think about how you would solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 &minus; 3x + 2 = 0\).</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> The factored form is \((x &minus; 1)(x &minus; 2) = 0\). </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> The solutions are \(x = 1\) and \(x = 2\). </li>
</ul>
<p>Now think about how you would solve \(2x^2 &minus; 6x + 4 = 0\).</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Factor out the GCF, 2. </li>
</ul>
<p>\(2(x^2 &minus; 3x + 2) = 0\)</p>
<p>It looks similar to the previous quadratic equation.</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> The factored form is \(2(x &minus; 1)(x &minus; 2) = 0\). </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Once again, the solutions are \(x = 1\) and \(x = 2\). </li>
</ul>
<p>Since they have the same solutions, these two quadratic equations are related. They have the same zeros and the same axis of symmetry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we are reversing this process, going from the zeros of a quadratic function to finding its standard form, it is possible there is a multiplier, such as 2 in the example above, that we do not know about.</p>
<p>To account for this, we use the variable \(a\) as the multiplier until we find out exactly what it is.</p>
<p>We can incorporate \(a\) into the function using the intercept form, \(f(x) = a(x &minus; p)(x &minus; q)\). The variables \(p\) and \(q\) represent the zeros or roots of the function.</p>
<p>Let's look at an example to help us understand.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Write the quadratic function, \(f(x)\), that has the zeros &ndash;5 and 4 and passes through the point \((-4, -16)\).</p>
<p>We know the zeros are &ndash;5 and 4, so the factored form of the quadratic function is:</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(f(x) = (x + 5)(x &minus; 4)\).</p>
<p>The intercept form is \(f(x) = a(x + 5)(x &minus; 4)\).</p>
<p>We are given one more piece of information that allows us to find the value of \(a\). We know that the function passes through the point \((-4, -16)\).</p>
<p>We can substitute &ndash;4 for \(x\) and &ndash;16 for the value of the function and solve for \(a\).</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent"> \(f(x) = a(x + 5)(x &minus; 4)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(-16 = a((-4) + 5)((-4) &minus; 4)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(-16 = a(1)(-8)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(-16 = -8a\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(2 = a\)</p>
<p>Since we know \(a = 2\), we can substitute 2 for \(a\) into the intercept form of the quadratic function.</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(f(x) = a(x + 5)(x &minus; 4)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(f(x) = 2(x + 5)(x &minus; 4)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(f(x) = 2(x^2 + 5x &minus; 4x &minus; 20)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(f(x) = 2(x^2 + x &minus; 20)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(f(x) = 2x^2 + 2x &minus; 40\)</p>
<p>The specific function that has zeros &ndash;5 and 4 and passes through the point \((-4, -16)\) is:</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(f(x) = 2x^2 + 2x &minus; 40\).</p>
<p>Let's graph the functions to check our work.</p>
<p><img alt="TWO GRAPHED PARABOLAS, ONE RED AND ONE GREEN, BOTH OPENING UP AND BOTH HAVING X-INTERCEPTS OF NEGATIVE 5 AND 4. THE GREEN PARABOLA HAS A Y-INTERCEPT OF NEGATIVE 20.

<p>Notice that \(f(x) = x^2 + x &minus; 20\) and \(f(x) = 2x^2 + 2x &minus; 40\) have the same zeros. These quadratic functions are related.</p>
<p>Only \(f(x) = 2x^2 + 2x &minus; 40\) passes through \((-4, -16)\) and is the specific function we were looking for at the start.</p>
<div class="os-raise-graybox">
  <p>It is very important to note that this is why, in the previous lesson, we were looking for &ldquo;a function that has zeros at &ndash;5 and 4&rdquo; and not &ldquo;the function that has zeros at &ndash;5 and 4.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This difference in wording is very important, since there are infinitely many functions that are related by their solutions.</p>
  <p>We can only determine an exact specific function if we have the additional information of a point through which the function passes.</p>
</div>
<p>Let's try one more example.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Write the quadratic function, \(g(x)\), in standard form, that has the zeros &ndash;7 and &ndash;3 and passes through the point \((-2, -5)\).</p>
<p>Since the zeros are &ndash;7 and &ndash;3, the factored form of the function is \(g(x) = (x + 7)(x + 3)\).</p>
<p>The intercept form of the function is \(g(x) = a(x + 7)(x + 3)\).</p>
<p>We substitute values using the point \((-2, -5)\) to find the value of \(a\).</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(g(x) = a(x + 7)(x + 3)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(-5 = a((-2) + 7)((-2) + 3)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(-5 = a(5)(1)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(-5 = 5a\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(-1 = a\)</p>
<p>Substitute the value of \(a\) into the intercept form of the function.</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(g(x) = a(x + 7)(x + 3)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(g(x) = -1(x + 7)(x + 3)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(g(x) = -1(x^2 + 7x + 3x + 21)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(g(x) = -1(x^2 + 10x + 21)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(g(x) = -x^2 &minus; 10x &minus; 21\)</p>
<p>The specific function that has zeros &ndash;7 and &ndash;3 and passes through the point \((-2, -5)\) is:</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(g(x) = -x^2 &minus; 10x &minus; 21\).</p>
<p>Let's graph the functions to check our work.</p>
<p><img alt="GRAPH OF TWO PARABOLAS, ONE RED AND ONE GREEN, BOTH WITH X-INTERCEPTS OF NEGATIVE 7 AND NEGATIVE 3. THE GREEN PARABOLA OPENS UP. THE RED PARABOLA OPENS DOWN AND PASSES THROUGH THE POINT (NEGATIVE 2, NEGATIVE 5)." height="377" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/9d9f7dfada4d9ec48f478a260dc7072929cf83bd" width="377"></p>
<p>Again, notice that \(g(x) = x^2 + 10x + 21\) and \(g(x) = &minus;x^2 &minus; 10x &minus; 21\) have the same zeros. They are related quadratic functions.</p>
<p>Even though the leading coefficient is negative and the function has been reflected over the \(x\)-axis, only \(g(x) = &minus;x^2 &minus; 10x &minus; 21\) passes through \((-2, -5)\).</p>
