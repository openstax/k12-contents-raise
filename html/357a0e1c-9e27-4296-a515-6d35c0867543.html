<h4>Interpreting Negative Exponents in Exponential Decay</h4>

<p>A scientist records the population of a bacterial population in a petri dish. The data are shown in the table.</p>

<p>The number of days \(d\) since the first test corresponds with the number of bacteria, \(b\), estimated to be alive in the petri dish.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    What is the decay factor? That is, what is \(f\)&nbsp;in an equation of the form \(b=n\cdot f^d\)? What is the starting population, \(n\), on the first day of testing?
    <br><br>
    Since the number of bacteria found on day 0 is 40,000, then \(n = 40,000\). Since after each day, the number of bacteria is cut in half, then the decay factor, \(f\), is \(\frac12\).
    <br><br>
    The equation to represent this situation is \(b=40,000\cdot\left(\frac12\right)^d\).
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    What do \(d=-1\) and \(d=-3\) mean in this context?
    <br><br>


    Since the day the first test is taken is defined as \(d=0\), then days with a negative value occured before the first test. \(d=-1\) means 1 day before the scientist did the first test. \(d=-3\) means 3 days before the scientist did the first test.

  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    How many bacteria were present 1 day before the first test?
    <br><br>

    Substitute &ndash;1 for \(d\) in the equation \(b=40,000\cdot\left(\frac12\right)^d\).<br><br>

    \(b=40,000\cdot\left(\frac12\right)^d\)
    <br>\(b=40,000\cdot\left(\frac12\right)^{-1}\)
    <br>\(b=40,000\cdot 2\)
    <br>\(b=80,000\)
    <br>
    <br>There were 80,000 bacteria in the petri dish 1 day before the test.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    Assume the peak of the bacterial population was 3 days before the first test. How many bacteria were present at the peak of the population?



    <br><br>
    Substitute &ndash;3 for \(d\) in the equation \(b=40,000\cdot\left(\frac12\right)^d\).
    <br><br>
    \(b=40,000\cdot\left(\frac12\right)^d\) <br>
    \(b=40,000\cdot\left(\frac12\right)^{-3}\) <br>
    \(b=40,000\cdot 8\) <br>
    \(b=320,000\)
    <br><br>
    There were 320,000 bacteria in the petri dish 3 days before the test at the peak of the
    population.
