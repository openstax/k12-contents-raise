<h3>Warm Up (10 minutes)</h3>
<br>
<p>This warm up recalls how to graph linear functions and which lines are parallel or perpendicular. It also introduces how one linear function can be shifted to another.</p>
<p>Later in the lesson, students will graph linear functions only using knowledge of transformations to prepare them for later units when they graph other functions with transformations.</p>
<p>For students who can benefit from a more accessible model, use geoboards and rubber bands. Use one color rubber band for the \(x\)- and \(y\)-axes. Use a different color for each line graphed. Work with students to count spots on the geoboard and discuss the graphs and their relationships.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Allow students to compare their graphs with their partners and discuss the relationships of the lines.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<br>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Use the Desmos graphing tool or technology outside the course. Graph the following lines given in slope-intercept form: (Students were provided access to Desmos)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>\(y=3x +4\)</li>
  <li>\(y=3x - 2\)</li>
</ul>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>What is the relationship between the two lines you graphed in question 1?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> They are parallel lines.</p>
<br>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>When you examine the equations of the lines, what do you notice is the same about the equations?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>The slopes of the lines are equal.</li>
  <li>The numbers in front of the variables are the same.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>When you examine the equations of the lines, what do you notice is different about the equations?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>The constant term is different in each equation.</li>
  <li>The number that is added to the equation is different.</li>
  <li>The \(y\)-intercepts for each equation is different.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>When you examine the graph of the lines, how many vertical spaces are between the two lines?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> There are 6 vertical spaces between the two lines.</p>
<br>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
  <li>On your coordinate grid, use the slope and \(y\)-intercept of each equation to graph each equation. Use a different color for each equation: (Students were provided access to Desmos)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>\(y=3x-2\)</li>
  <li>\(y=-\frac13 x-3\)</li>
</ul>

<br>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="7">
  <li>When you examine the graph of the lines in question 6, explain if the lines appear to be perpendicular.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>No, the lines don't look like they intersect at right angles - so they don't look like they are perpendicular. (Check the settings of your graph, this is incorrect.)</li>
  <li>Yes, the lines look like they intersect at right angles - so they appear perpendicular. (This is the correct answer.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to identify perpendicular lines algebraically, examine their slopes. If the slope values are opposite reciprocals, then the lines intersect at right angles and are perpendicular.</p>


<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their interpretations of the given equations and the new equations they wrote. Then, discuss with students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Do you notice any other relationships between pairs of lines?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How many vertical spaces are between lines \(a\) and \(b\)?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
