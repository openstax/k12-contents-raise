<h3>Warm Up (10 minutes)</h3>
<br>
<p>This warm-up recalls how to graph linear functions and which lines are parallel or perpendicular. It also introduces how one linear function can be shifted to another.</p>
<p>Later in the lesson, students will graph linear functions only using knowledge of transformations to prepare them for later units when they graph other functions with transformations.</p>
<p>For students who can benefit from a more accessible model, use geoboards and rubber bands. Use one color rubber band for the \(x\)- and \(y\)-axes. Use a different color for each line graphed. Work with students to count spots on the geoboard and discuss the graphs and their relationships.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Allow students to compare their graphs with their partners and discuss the relationships of the lines.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>On your coordinate grid, use the slope and \(y\)-intercept of each equation to graph each equation.</p>
<p>Use a different color for each equation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(y=3x +4\) </li>
  <li> \(y=3x - 2\) </li>
  <li> \(y=\frac13 x +1\) </li>
  <li> \(y=-\frac13 x -3\) </li>
</ul>
<p>Use the graphing tool here or technology outside the course. </p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their interpretations of the given equations and the new equations they wrote. Then, discuss with students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Do you notice any other relationships between pairs of lines?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How many vertical spaces are between lines \(a\) and \(b\)?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
