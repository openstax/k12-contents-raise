<p>In this lesson, you will analyze points on and off a graph and interpret them in context. In explaining correspondences between equations, verbal descriptions, and graphs, you will hone your skill at making sense of problems.</p>
<p><span>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</span><br></p>

<ul>
<li>Use graphing technology to graph linear equations and identify solutions to the equations.</li>
<li>Explain how the coordinates of the points on the graph of a linear equation are related to the equation.</li>
<li>Explain the meaning of points on a graph in terms of the situation it represents when given the graph of a linear equation.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
