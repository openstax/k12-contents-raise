<h4>Writing Equations Using Symbols</h4>
<p>Here are two more examples of writing statements algebraically using symbols.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>We want to express the following statement using symbolic language:&nbsp;<br><span>The sum&nbsp;</span><span>of three consecutive integers is 372.</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Do the first step, and hold up your whiteboard.<ul>
      <li>Let&nbsp;\( x \) be the first integer.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If we let \( x \) represent the first integer, what do we need to do to get the next&nbsp;<span>consecutive integer?</span>
    <ul>
      <li>If \( x \) is the first integer, we add 1 to \( x \) to get the next integer.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In symbols, the next integer would be \(&nbsp;洧논 + 1&nbsp;\). What do we need to do now to get the next consecutive integer?<ul>
      <li>We need to add 1 to that integer, or \(&nbsp;洧논 + 1+ 1&nbsp;\); this is the same as \(&nbsp;洧논 +2&nbsp;\).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Now, express the statement: The sum of three consecutive integers is 372.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>\(&nbsp;洧논 + 洧논 +1 + 洧논 + 2 = 372&nbsp;\)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong><br></p>
<p>We want to express the following statement using symbolic language: <br>The sum&nbsp;<span>of three consecutive odd integers is 93.</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Do the first step, and hold up your whiteboard.<ul>
      <li>Let \( x \) be the first odd integer.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If we let \( x \) represent the first odd integer, what do we need to do to get the next&nbsp;<span>odd integer?</span>
    <ul>
      <li>If \( x \) is the first odd integer, we add 2 to \( x \) to get the next odd integer.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In symbols, the next odd integer would be \(&nbsp;洧논 + 2&nbsp;\). What do we need to do now to get the next odd integer?<ul>
      <li>We need to add 2 to that odd integer, or \(&nbsp;洧논 + 2 +2&nbsp;\); this is the same as \(&nbsp;洧논 + 4&nbsp;\).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Now, express the statement: The sum of three consecutive odd integers is 93.<ul>
      <li>\(&nbsp;洧논 + 洧논 +2 + 洧논 + 4 = 93&nbsp;\)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Represent the statement &ldquo;The sum of three consecutive odd integers is 93&rdquo; in another way. Be prepared to&nbsp;<span>explain why both are correct.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Answers will vary. Accept any correct answers and justifications. For example, students may write \(&nbsp;洧논 + 洧논 + 洧논 + 6 = 93&nbsp;\)&nbsp;<span>and state that it is equivalent to the equation \( 洧논 +洧논 +2 + 洧논 + 4 = 93 \). Because&nbsp;</span><span>the associative and commutative properties of addition were applied, those properties do not change&nbsp;</span><span>the value of an expression.</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
