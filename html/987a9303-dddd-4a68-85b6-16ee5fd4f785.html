<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity prompts students to look at how the \(y\)-intercept in slope-intercept form affects the graph of a
  linear function. Circulate to ensure students are graphing their lines properly. If necessary, partner students during
  the graphing process.</p>
<p>In pairs, students should discuss the vertical shifts to the parent function, \(f(x)=x\), to graph the new functions.
</p>
<h4> Launch</h4>
<p>Ask students if they have ever played a board game. Connect rolling dice and moving that number of spots to the
  number of spots a line can shift up the graph.</p>
<p>For students who can benefit from a more accessible model, use geoboards and rubber bands. Use one color rubber band
  for the \(x\)- and \(y\)-axes. Use a different color for each line graphed. Work with students to count spots on the
  geoboard and discuss the graphs and their relationships.</p>
<h4>Student Activity </h4>
<h4>Horizontal Notation \(f(x-c)\)</h4>
<p>Horizontal notation, also known as &quot;functional notation,&quot; is a way to represent a function using
  parentheses and a variable within them. It is commonly written as \(f(x)\) or \(g(x)\), where \(f\) and \(g\) are the
  names of the functions, and \(x\) is the variable.</p>
<p>Here's an example problem using horizontal notation:</p>
<p>Given the function \(f(x) = 2x + 5\), find the value of \(f(3)\).</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>To find the value of \(f(3)\), we substitute 3 into the function in place of \(x\).</p>
<p>\(f(3) = 2(3) + 5\)</p>
<p>\(f(3) = 6 + 5\)</p>
<p>\(f(3) = 11\)</p>
<p>Therefore, the value of \(f(3)\) is 11.</p>
<p>In this example, we used the horizontal notation \(f(x)\) to represent the function, and then we evaluated the function
  at \(x = 3\) by replacing \(x\) with 3 in the function and performing the calculations.</p>
<h4>Solve this Problem</h4>
<p>Given the function \(f(x) = 2x - 3\), find the value of \(f(5)\).</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 7</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to create other questions for students to answer about how much one linear function must shift to get
  to another.</p>

        <p>That&rsquo;s correct! Check yourself: In the two equations, the \(b\), or \(y\)-intercept of \(y=mx+b\),
          changes. This determines the vertical change. From &ndash;3 to 5 is a vertical shift up 8.</p>

<h4>Vertical Shifts and \(y\)-Intercepts</h4>
<p>In the equation \(f(x)=mx+b\):</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(b\) is the \(y\)-intercept of the graph and indicates the point \((0,b)\) at which the graph crosses the
    \(y\)-axis. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>\(m\) is the slope of the line and indicates the vertical displacement (rise) and horizontal displacement (run)
    between each successive pair of points. </li>
</ul>
<p><img
    alt="This graph shows how to calculate the rise over run for the slope on an x, y coordinate plane.  The x-axis runs from negative 2 to 7. The y-axis runs from negative 2 to 5. The line extends right and upward from point (0,1), which is the y-intercept.  A dotted line extends two units to the right from point (0, 1) and is labeled Run = 2.  The same dotted line extends upwards one unit and is labeled Rise =1."

<p>The \(y\)-intercept tells where the parent function, \(f(x)=x\), has shifted up or down.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Tell how \(f(x)=x+7\) has shifted from the parent function \(f(x)=x\).<br>
  Since \(b=7\), the \(y\)-intercept is +7, so the graph shifts up 7 from the parent function.</p>
<p> Example 2:</p>
<p>Tell how \(f(x)=x-9\) has shifted from the parent function \(f(x)=x\).<br>
  Since \(b=-9\), the \(y\)-intercept is &ndash;9, so the graph shifts down 9 from the parent function.</p>
<h4>Try It: Vertical Shifts and \(y\)-Intercepts</h4>
<p>Tell the shift made to \(f(x)=x\) to arrive at \(f(x)=x - 4\).</p>
<p>Write down your answer. Then select the <strong>solution </strong>button to compare your work.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Here is how to find the shift made to \(f(x)=x\):</p>
<p>Since the \(b\) of slope-intercept form is &ndash;4, this is also the \(y\)-intercept. Therefore, the graph of
  \(f(x)=x\) is shifted down 4 to arrive at \(f(x)=x-4\).</p>
