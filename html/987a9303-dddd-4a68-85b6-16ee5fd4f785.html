<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity prompts students to look at how the \(y\)-intercept in slope-intercept form affects the graph of a linear function. Circulate to ensure students are graphing their lines properly. If necessary, partner students during the graphing process.</p>
<p>In pairs, students should discuss the vertical shifts to the parent function, \(f(x)=x\), to graph the new functions.</p>
<h4> Launch</h4>
<p>Ask students if they have ever played a board game. Connect rolling dice and moving that number of spots to the number of spots a line can shift up the graph.</p>
<p>For students who can benefit from a more accessible model, use geoboards and rubber bands. Use one color rubber band for the \(x\)- and \(y\)-axes. Use a different color for each line graphed. Work with students to count spots on the geoboard and discuss the graphs and their relationships.</p>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement </h4>
<p>On the same coordinate grid, graph the following linear functions. Use a different color for each:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(f(x)=x+4\) </li>
  <li> \(f(x)=x+2\) </li>
  <li> \(f(x)=x\) </li>
  <li> \(f(x)=x-2\) </li>
  <li> \(f(x)=x-4\) </li>
</ul>
<p>Compare your graph to the one below:</p>
<p><img alt="This graph shows six versions of the function, f of x = x, on an x, y coordinate plane. The x-axis runs from negative 8 to 8, and the y axis runs negative 8 to 8. There are five lines parallel to each other. The first line extends from the bottom left quadrant to the upper right quadrant on the coordinate plane. This line shows f of x = x plus 4 which has a slope of 1 and a y-intercept at 4. The next line also extends from the bottom left quadrant to the upper right quadrant and shows f of x = x plus 2 which has a slope of 1 and a y-intercept at 2. The next and middle line, extends from the lower left quadrant, through the center of the graph at point (0, 0) to the upper right quadrant and shows f of x = x. The next line extends from the lower left quadrant, through the lower right quadrant to the upper right quadrant. This line shows f of x = x minus 2 which has a slope of 1 and a y-intercept at -2.

<p>What changed with these functions? How did this change their graphs?</p>
<p>In \(f(x)=mx+b\), the \(b\) acts as the vertical shift. This is a type of transformation to the graph of \(f(x)=x\). The vertical shift &ldquo;transforms&rdquo; the parent function into another function.</p>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> 1</li>
  <li> Shift up 2 </li>
  <li> Shift down 4</li>
  <li>Sample Response:<br>
    The constant added to or subtracted from x changed. When a number was added to x, it shifted the line up that many units. When a number was subtracted from x, it shifted the line down that many units.. </li>
</ol>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to create other questions for students to answer about how much one linear function must shift to get to another.</p>

        <p>That&rsquo;s correct! Check yourself: In the two equations, the \(b\), or \(y\)-intercept of \(y=mx+b\), changes. This determines the vertical change. From &ndash;3 to 5 is a vertical shift up 8.</p>

<h4>4.10.2: Additional Resources</h4>
<p><strong><em>The following content is available to students who would like more support based on their experience with the self check. Students will not automatically have access to this content, so you may wish to share it with those who could benefit from it.</em></strong></p>
<h4>Vertical Shifts and \(y\)-Intercepts</h4>
<p>In the equation \(f(x)=mx+b\):</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(b\) is the \(y\)-intercept of the graph and indicates the point \((0,b)\) at which the graph crosses the \(y\)-axis. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>\(m\) is the slope of the line and indicates the vertical displacement (rise) and horizontal displacement (run) between each successive pair of points. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="This graph shows how to calculate the rise over run for the slope on an x, y coordinate plane.  The x-axis runs from negative 2 to 7. The y-axis runs from negative 2 to 5. The line extends right and upward from point (0,1), which is the y-intercept.  A dotted line extends two units to the right from point (0, 1) and is labeled Run = 2.  The same dotted line extends upwards one unit and is labeled Rise =1." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/fa8d440278a4d73105cd08756daceb00bac43939"></p>
<p>The \(y\)-intercept tells where the parent function, \(f(x)=x\), has shifted up or down.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Tell how \(f(x)=x+7\) has shifted from the parent function \(f(x)=x\).<br>
  Since \(b=7\), the \(y\)-intercept is +7, so the graph shifts up 7 from the parent function.</p>
<p> Example 2:</p>
<p>Tell how \(f(x)=x-9\) has shifted from the parent function \(f(x)=x\).<br>
  Since \(b=-9\), the \(y\)-intercept is &ndash;9, so the graph shifts down 9 from the parent function.</p>
<h4>Try It: Vertical Shifts and \(y\)-Intercepts</h4>
<p>Tell the shift made to \(f(x)=x\) to arrive at \(f(x)=x - 4\).</p>
<p>Write down your answer. Then select the <strong>solution </strong>button to compare your work.<br>
</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to find the shift made to \(f(x)=x\):</p>
<p>Since the \(b\) of slope-intercept form is &ndash;4, this is also the \(y\)-intercept. Therefore, the graph of \(f(x)=x\) is shifted down 4 to arrive at \(f(x)=x-4\).</p>
