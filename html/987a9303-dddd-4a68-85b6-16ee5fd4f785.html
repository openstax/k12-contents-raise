<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity prompts students to look at how the \(y\)-intercept in slope-intercept form affects the graph of a
  linear function. Circulate to ensure students are graphing their lines properly. If necessary, partner students during
  the graphing process.</p>
<p>In pairs, students should discuss the vertical shifts to the parent function, \(f(x)=x\), to graph the new functions.
</p>
<h4> Launch</h4>
<p>Ask students if they have ever played a board game. Connect rolling dice and moving that number of spots to the
  number of spots a line can shift up the graph.</p>
<p>For students who can benefit from a more accessible model, use geoboards and rubber bands. Use one color rubber band
  for the \(x\)- and \(y\)-axes. Use a different color for each line graphed. Work with students to count spots on the
  geoboard and discuss the graphs and their relationships.</p>

<p>If the \(d\) value is positive, the graph of the function shifts up. If the \(d\) value is negative, the graph of the function shifts down. </p>

<p>That’s correct! Check yourself: In the two equations, the \(b\), or \(y\)-intercept of \(y=mx+b\),
          changes. This determines the vertical change. From –3 to 5 is a vertical shift up 8.</p>

<h4>Vertical Shifts and \(y\)-Intercepts</h4>
<p>In the equation \(f(x)=mx+b\):</p>
<ul>
<li>\(b\) is the \(y\)-intercept of the graph and indicates the point \((0,b)\) at which the graph crosses the
    \(y\)-axis. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>\(m\) is the slope of the line and indicates the vertical displacement (rise) and horizontal displacement (run)
    between each successive pair of points. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="This graph shows how to calculate the rise over run for the slope on an x, y coordinate plane. The x-axis runs from negative 2 to 7. The y-axis runs from negative 2 to 5. The line extends right and upward from point (0,1), which is the y-intercepts. A dotted line extends two units to the right from point (0, 1) and is labeled Run equals 2. The same dotted line extends upwards one unit and is labeled Rise equals 1." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/fa8d440278a4d73105cd08756daceb00bac43939"/></p>
<p>The \(y\)-intercept tells where the parent function, \(f(x)=x\), has shifted up or down.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Tell how \(f(x)=x+7\) has shifted from the parent function \(f(x)=x\).<br/>
<strong>Solution:</strong> Since \(b=7\), the \(y\)-intercept is +7, so the graph shifts up 7 from the parent function.</p>
<p> <strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Tell how \(f(x)=x-9\) has shifted from the parent function \(f(x)=x\).<br/>
<strong>Solution:</strong> Since \(b=-9\), the \(y\)-intercept is –9, so the graph shifts down 9 from the parent function.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>
<p>
  Tell how \(f(x) = 2x + 1\) has shifted from \(f(x) = 2x + 5\).<br/>
<strong> Solution:</strong> Since \(b = 1\), the \(y\)-intercept is 1. This point is 4 vertical units below the \(y\)-intercepts of the original line that had a \(y\)-intercept of 5. So, the graph shifts down 4 units from \(f(x) = 2x + 5\) to arrive at \(f(x) = 2x +1\). 
</p>

<div class="os-raise-graybox">
<h5>Vertical Shift of a Function</h5>
<p>A vertical shift “transforms” the parent function into another function by moving the graph up or down \(d\) units. </p>
<p align="center">Vertical Shift → \(f(x) + d\)</p>
</div>
<br/>
<p>If the \(d\) value is positive, the graph of the function shifts up. If the \(d\) value is negative, the graph of the function shifts down. </p>
<h4>Try It: Vertical Shifts and \(y\)-Intercepts</h4>
<p>Tell the shift made to \(f(x)=x\) to arrive at \(f(x)=x - 4\).</p>
<p>Write down your answer. Then select the <strong>solution </strong>button to compare your work.<br/>
</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Here is how to find the shift made to \(f(x)=x\):</p>
<p>Since the \(b\) of slope-intercept form is –4, this is also the \(y\)-intercept. Therefore, the graph of
  \(f(x)=x\) is shifted down 4 to arrive at \(f(x)=x-4\).</p>
