<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>The purpose of this activity is for students to practice defining sequences as arithmetic, geometric, or neither. Several of the sequences selected are ones students have seen previously. The sequence 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, . . . is from the Tower of Hanoi puzzle and is the only sequence in the activity that is neither arithmetic nor geometric.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. After quiet work time, ask students to compare their responses to their partner&rsquo;s for sequences A and B and decide if they are both correct, even if they are different. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<p>Use the first 5 terms of each sequence to state if the sequence is arithmetic, geometric, or neither.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>The purpose of this discussion is for students to notice some common features of arithmetic and geometric sequences. Display the six sequences for all to see throughout the discussion to record the sequence type next to each sequence.</p>
<p>For the sequences A and B, invite previously identified groups to share the sequence type. Repeat this process for the remaining sequences.</p>
<p>Conclude the discussion by inviting students to share things they notice about the different sequence types. (The arithmetic sequences have adding or subtracting a term, the geometric sequences have multiplying by a term, and the sequence that is neither is a mix of adding and multiplying.) If not brought up by students, remind them that arithmetic sequences are a type of linear function and geometric sequences are a type of exponential function, so it makes sense to see only addition and subtraction for arithmetic sequences and only multiplication for geometric sequences.</p>
<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<div>
<p>Use this routine to support whole-class discussion. After each student shares, provide the class with the following sentence frames to help them respond: &ldquo;I agree because . . .&rdquo; or &ldquo;I disagree because . . .&rdquo; If necessary, re-voice student ideas to demonstrate mathematical language use by restating a statement as a question to clarify, apply appropriate language, and involve more students.</p>
