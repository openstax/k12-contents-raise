<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Use tables, calculations, and graphs to compare growth rates of linear and exponential functions and predict how the quantities eventually change. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the<strong> activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li> 5.14.1: Distinguish Linear and Exponential Growth </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you analyzed a graph to determine if it was linear or exponential growth. You also had to justify your response and decide what information would make it easier to determine if the graph was linear or exponential. </li>
</ul>
<li> 5.14.2: Using Tables to Compare Linear and Exponential Growth Functions </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you compared linear and exponential growth in a context involving simple and compound interest. You were also required to analyze the necessary mathematics in the context of a real-world situation and justify your choices. </li>
</ul>
<li> 5.14.2: Self Check&nbsp; </li>
<li> 5.14.3: Compare Linear Functions with Exponential Functions&nbsp; </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you compared a linear function with an exponential one without a context, and you noticed that the exponential function grew much more slowly over a long period of time. </li>
</ul>
<li> 5.14.3: Self Check&nbsp; </li>
<li> 5.14.4: Using Function Notation to Compare Linear and Exponential Functions </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you explored approaches to estimate values to compare the two functions when only the equations are provided. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li> 5.14.5: Practice </li>
