<h4> Optional Activity</h4>
<p>Your teacher will give your group three different kinds of balls.</p>
<p>Your goal is to measure the rebound heights, model the relationship between the number of bounces and the heights,
  and compare the bounciness of the balls.</p>

    <p> The difference in height after 5 bounces is 5.5.<br>
      Using the equation: <br>

        \( \frac{1}{2}\) for each bounce after that. So, after 1 more bounce (the 5th bounce), it will decrease by a factor of about \( \frac{1}{2}\).
