<h4> Optional Activity</h4>
<p>Your teacher will give your group three different kinds of balls.</p>
<p>Your goal is to measure the rebound heights, model the relationship between the number of bounces and the heights,
  and compare the bounciness of the balls.</p>

  <p>The bounciness of the ball is measured by the rebound factor, which is the base of the exponential expression. That

        the number of bounces \(n\)? </li>
      <li> Ball 5 was dropped from a height of 150 centimeters. It bounced up very slightly once or twice and then began
        rolling. How would you describe its rebound factor? Be prepared to show your reasoning. </li>

    <p>Compare your answer:</p>
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
      <li> The same. The bounciness of the ball does not depend on the height from which it is dropped. This is why the
        successive rebound heights are modeled by an exponential function. </li>
      <li> \(h=150(\frac{1}{5})^n\) </li>
      <li> The rebound factor is very close to 0. Because the ball barely left the ground after hitting it, we could say
        that it lost almost all of its height with each bounce. </li>
