<p>The English Language Proficiency Standards (ELPS) Framework Section C includes the cross-curricular second language acquisition essential knowledge and skills standards. Five standards guide the integration of language acquisition into all content areas. The Texas Education Agency (TEA) requires that each standard and student's expectations be covered within the subject-level curriculum. </p>
<p>These standards focus on language acquisition. Listening, speaking, reading, and writing are the hallmarks of the skills needed to master the English language. Many student expectations can quickly and easily be integrated into a mathematics classroom, but some focus on skills we don’t often associate with math content.</p>

<h4>Differentiation of Learning
</h4>
<p>The English Language Learner (ELL) students in your classroom will have varying levels of English language skills that are necessary to develop an understanding of mathematical language, knowledge, and skills. As a classroom teacher, you will have preliterate newcomers in need of developmental reading instruction in your math classroom. You will need to provide these newcomers the time to develop their English familiarity and skills. You can help this by building their vocabulary base before beginning math content instruction.</p>
<p>  It’s important to have multiple levels and types of scaffolding to support learning new concepts. Teachers should use their professional judgment about which routines to use and when based on their knowledge of students' individual needs in their classroom. </p>
<p>Based on their observations of student language, teachers can make adjustments to their teaching and provide additional language support where necessary. When making decisions about how to support access for English learners, teachers should take into account the language demands of the specific activity and the language needed to engage the content more broadly, in relation to their students’ current ways of using language to communicate ideas as well as their students’ English language proficiency.</p>

<p>One way that you can differentiate learning is by providing students dual-language support for learning new vocabulary. Preliterate, beginner, and newcomer English language learners benefit from receiving mathematical language instruction in their home language before learning it in English. For this reason, we have created vocabulary supports in both English and Spanish.   A dual lingual glossary is located in the Additional Resources for students in the Getting Started section. Quizlet vocabulary cards are located on the Lesson Overview pages in each Teacher Guide.</p>
<p>Here is a sampling of the dual-language quizlets and glossary:

<h4>Building a Library of Resources</h4>

<p>Throughout this Algebra 1 curriculum, we provide resources and strategies to support your ELL students.  You’ll see samples of ways to integrate the language domains. These language domains directly align to the ELPS standards. </p>
