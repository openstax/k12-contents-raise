<li>&ldquo;How would you explain average rate of change to a classmate who is absent today? What does it tell us? How do we find it?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Which representation&mdash;a table or a graph&mdash;can give us a better sense of the general trend of a function over a certain interval? Why?&rdquo; (A graph, because we can visualize a line that fits the data in an interval and reason about its slope.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;What does a negative average rate of change tell us?&rdquo; (The output of the function is decreasing for every unit of increase in input.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;If a function has a negative average rate of change over an interval, does it mean that the function value never increases?&rdquo; (No, there might be parts of the interval where the function value rises, but overall it is falling.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;When dealing with Mai and Tyler&rsquo;s case, we compared average rates of change over two intervals that are not the same length. Was that a fair comparison? Does the length of the interval matter?&rdquo; (Yes, it is a fair comparison. The length of the interval doesn&rsquo;t matter because an average rate of change gives the amount of change per unit of input.)</li>
