<h4> Determining the Growth Rate of Exponential Functions</h4>
<p>For the table below, assume the function \(f\) is defined for all real numbers. Calculate \(\triangle f = f(x+1)-f(x)\) in the last column. (The symbol \(\triangle\) in this context means &ldquo;change in.&rdquo;) What do you notice about \(\triangle f\)? Could the function be linear or exponential? Write a linear or an exponential function formula that generates the same input&ndash;output pairs as given in the table.</p>

<p>For each row, you subtract \(f(x)\) values. The first row would be \(6- 2 =4\), then \(18 - 6 =12\), then \(54 - 18 =36\), and then \(162 - 54 = 108\). Since the rate of change isn&rsquo;t consistent, it is not a linear function.&nbsp; Exponential functions have a growth factor or a repeated rate that terms are being multiplied by. If you divide consecutive terms, you will find the growth rate is 3. Notice that the change between consecutive terms also has a growth rate of 3.</p>
<p>Since this function is exponential, an equation will have the form \(f(x) = initial \;\ value \;\ (growth \;\ rate)^x\). The growth rate is 3. The initial value is the same as the \(y\)-intercept, or where \(x=0\). \(f(0)\) is given in the table, so the initial value is 2. The equation for this table would be \(f(x) = 2(3)^x\).</p>

<p>Here is how to write the equation of an exponential function from a graph:</p>
<p>The graph seems to be exponential. If you find the rate of change between consecutive points, you find the graph is exponential and the rate of change is 2 since the \(y\)-values increase by a factor of 2 every time the \(x\)-values increase by 1. Since the graph crosses the \(y\)-axis at \((0,1)\), that is the initial value. The equation for this graph is \(f(x) = 2^x\).</p>
