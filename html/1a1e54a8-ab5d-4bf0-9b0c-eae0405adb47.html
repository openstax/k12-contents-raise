<ul>
  <li><span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>How would you explain &lsquo;a system of equations&rsquo; to a classmate who is absent today?&rdquo;</span></span>
    <ul>
      <li><span><span><span>Two or more equations that represent the constraints in the same situation form a system of equations.</span></span></span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span><span>What would you say if they asked, &lsquo;What does it mean to solve the system of equations?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></span>
    <ul>
      <li><span><span><span>The solution to a system of equations is a pair of values that makes all of the equations in the system true. Graphing the equations is one way to find the solution to a system of equations.</span></span></span></li>

  <ul>
    <li><span><span>The solutions are pairs of values.</span></span></li>
    <li><span><span>The solutions are points on the graph of each equation.</span></span></li>
    <li><span><span>We can solve by using the graph.</span></span></li>
    <li><span><span>We can solve by substituting different values for \( x \) and \( y \) and seeing which pairs of values make the equation true.</span></span></li>
  </ul>
  <p dir="ltr"><strong>Different:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><span><span>To solve a linear equation in two variables is to find pairs of values that make one equation true (or meet one constraint). To solve a system is to find pairs of values that simultaneously make both equations in the system true (or meet both constraints in a situation).</span></span></li>
    <li><span><span>There are many solutions to a linear equation in two variables, but there might only be one (or no) solution to a system of linear equations in two variables.</span></span></li>
    <li><span><span>The solution to a linear equation in two variables could be any point on the graph. The solution to a system must be the intersection of the two graphs</span></span></li>
