<p>To help students articulate the big ideas in this lesson and connect them to prior ideas, ask them questions such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;How would you explain &lsquo;a system of equations&rsquo; to a classmate who is absent today?&rdquo;
    <ul>
      <li>Two or more equations that represent the constraints in the same situation form a system of equations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What would you say if they asked, &lsquo;What does it mean to solve the system of equations?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    <ul>
      <li>The solution to a system of equations is a pair of values that makes all of the equations in the system true.
        Graphing the equations is one way to find the solution to a system of equations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>&ldquo;Here are graphs that represent this system&nbsp;\( \begin{cases} x + y = 4 \\ 5x + 10y = 25 \end{cases} \)
    .&rdquo; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Which point or points are solutions to the equation \( x + y = 4 \)?&rdquo; (E and C)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Which are solutions to \( 5x + 10y = 25 \)?&rdquo; (D and C)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Which are solutions to the system?&rdquo; (C)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;What is alike and what is different about solving a single linear equation in two variables, say \( x + y =
    4 \), and solving a system of equations, say \( \begin{cases} x + y = 4 \\ 5x + 10y = 25 \end{cases} \)?&rdquo;
  </li>
</ul>
<p>(Consider setting up a two-column organizer and recording students&rsquo; responses accordingly. Here is an example.)
</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Alike:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The solutions are pairs of values.</li>
  <li>The solutions are points on the graph of each equation.</li>
  <li>We can solve by using the graph.</li>
  <li>We can solve by substituting different values for \( x \) and \( y \) and seeing which pairs of values make the
    equation true.</li>
</ul>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Different:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To solve a linear equation in two variables is to find pairs of values that make one equation true (or meet one
    constraint). To solve a system is to find pairs of values that simultaneously make both equations in the system true
    (or meet both constraints in a situation).</li>
  <li>There are many solutions to a linear equation in two variables, but there might only be one (or no) solution to a
    system of linear equations in two variables.</li>
  <li>The solution to a linear equation in two variables could be any point on the graph. The solution to a system must
    be the intersection of the two graphs</li>
</ul>
