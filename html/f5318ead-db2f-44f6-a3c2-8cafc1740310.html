<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Solve an equation for one of the variables.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities </strong>that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1.9.1: Rearranging an Equation in Three Variables<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you rearranged the equation, V+F-2+E, to find the number of faces, vertices, or edges of different platonic solids.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1.9.2: Writing an Equation to Represent a Constraint<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you wrote an equation to represent the constraints of shipments of cars and trucks. You then rearranged the equation to find the number of cars and number of trucks that could be in the shipment.</li>

    </ul>

  <li>1.9.3: Writing and Rearranging Equations in Two Variables<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you wrote an equation about the budget of a city for road resurfacing and worker salaries. You rearranged the equations to help solve for the number of workers that could be hired and the number of miles of roads that could be resurfaced. Solving for different variables in an equation can help you answer different questions.</li>
