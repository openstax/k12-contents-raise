<p>The purpose of this synthesis is for students to practice calculating the average rate of change for an exponential function over specific intervals and to consider when the average rate of change adequately describes the function over that interval.</p>
<p>Show students the table, which gives the value in dollars of a laptop originally purchased for $1,500 and losing \(\frac35\) of its value every year after purchase.</p>

<p>Ask students</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;About how much was the average rate of change for the 5-year period?&rdquo; (almost $300 per year) </li>
<li>&ldquo;Does the average rate of change accurately describe how the value of the laptop changes over the 5 years?&rdquo; (No, it loses almost $1,000 in value the first year and very little from the third year to the fifth.) </li>
<li>&ldquo;Are there some years where the average rate of change shows how the value of the laptop is changing?&rdquo; (Yes; from year 1 to year 2, it is a reasonable estimate.) </li>
</ul>
