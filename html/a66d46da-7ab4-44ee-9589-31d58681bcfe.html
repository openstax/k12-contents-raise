<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>By now, students have seen how the parameters of a quadratic expression in standard form and in factored form relate to the graph representing the function. In the past few lessons, students worked with decontextualized quadratic functions. In this lesson, they transfer what they learned about the graphs to make sense of quadratic functions that model concrete contexts.</p>
<p>Students interpret equations and graphs of quadratic functions in terms of the situations they represent. They use their analyses to solve problems and to compare quadratic functions given in different representations. Along the way, they practice reasoning quantitatively and abstractly.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Interpret (orally and in writing) the graph and equation representing a function in terms of the context. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Explain how a quadratic equation and its graph relate to a situation. </li>
</ul>

<h4> Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A1(F) use accessible language and learn new and essential language in the process</li>
  <li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment
  </li>
  <li>A3(B) expand and internalize initial English vocabulary by learning and using high-frequency English words necessary for identifying and describing people, places, and objects, by retelling simple stories and basic information represented or supported by pictures, and by learning and using routine language needed for classroom communication 
  </li>
  <li>A3(D) speak using grade-level content area vocabulary in context to internalize new English words and build academic language proficiency</li>
  <li>A3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions 
  </li>
  <li>A3(F) ask and give information ranging from using a very limited bank of high-frequency, high-need, concrete vocabulary, including key words and expressions needed for basic communication in academic and social contexts, to using abstract and content-based vocabulary during extended speaking assignments
  </li>
  <li>A4(D) use prereading supports such as graphic organizers, illustrations, and pretaught topic-related vocabulary and other prereading activities to enhance comprehension of written text
  </li>
  <li>A5(B) write using newly acquired basic vocabulary and content-based grade-level vocabulary
  </li>
</ul>
