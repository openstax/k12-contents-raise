<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity prompts students to use the equations from activity 1.14.2 to find an answer to a question involving their situation. Students will find how many calories are burned on a treadmill and how far a train travels in a set amount of time.<br></p>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<p>While students are working, be sure to circulate to make sure that groups are entering the correct values in equations. Ask questions like &ldquo;is that value the input or the output?&rdquo; And, &ldquo;which variable represents the input in your equation.&rdquo; After the activity, there is a video that will help struggling students solve direct variation problems. Finally, if there is extra time, have groups create another question from their given situation and give it to another group to solve it!</p>
<h3>Student-Facing Statement&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Return to your original group and work through this next part of your assigned problem. Then be ready to share.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<ol>
<li>When Raoul runs on the treadmill at the gym, the number of calories, c, he burns varies directly with the number of minutes, m, he uses the treadmill. He burned 315 calories when he used the treadmill for 18 minutes.&nbsp;<ul>
<li>How many calories would he burn if he ran on the treadmill for 25 minutes?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The number of calories, c, burned varies directly with the amount of time, t, spent exercising. Arnold burned 312 calories in 65 minutes exercising.&nbsp;
    <ul>
<li>&gt;How many calories would he burn if he exercises for 90 minutes?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The distance a moving body travels, d, varies directly with time, t, it moves. A train travels 100 miles in 2 hours.</li>
</ol>
<p>How many miles would it travel in 5 hours?<br></p>

<h3><br>Student Response</h3>
<ol>
<li>c=437.5, so Raoul would burn 437.5 calories if he used the treadmill for 25 minutes</li>
<li>c=432</li>
<li>250 miles</li>
</ol>
<h3>Student-Facing Extension</h3>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>For example 1, how could you find out how many minutes Raoul would need to use the treadmill to burn a certain amount of calories?</p>
<h3>Extension Student Response</h3>
<p>Sample response: Substitute the number of calories you want to burn into the equation for \( c \), then solve for \( m \).<br></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s correct! Check yourself: The constant of variation is \( \frac{28}{4}=7 \). The equation is now \( p=7h \). After 9 hours, Sophia makes 63 parts.</p>

<h3>1.14.3: Solve Application Problems Using Direct Variation</h3>
<p>In applications using direct variation, generally we will know values of one pair of the variables and will be asked to find the equation that relates \( x \) and \( y \). Then we can use that equation to find values of \( y \) for other values of \( x \).</p>
