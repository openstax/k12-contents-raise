<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity prompts students to use the equations from activity 1.14.2 to find an answer to a question involving their situation. Students will find how many calories are burned on a treadmill and how far a train travels in a set amount of time.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>While students are working, be sure to circulate to make sure that groups are entering the correct values in equations. Ask questions like &ldquo;is that value the input or the output?&rdquo; And, &ldquo;which variable represents the input in your equation.&rdquo; After the activity, there is a video that will help struggling students solve direct variation problems. Finally, if there is extra time, have groups create another question from their given situation and give it to another group to solve it!</p>
<h4>Student Activity&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Return to your original group and work through this next part of your assigned problem. Then be ready to share.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>When Raoul runs on the treadmill at the gym, the number of calories, \(c\), he burns varies directly with the number of minutes, \(m\), he uses the treadmill. He burned 315 calories when he used the treadmill for 18 minutes.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<p>How many calories would he burn if he ran on the treadmill for 25 minutes?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(c = 437.5\), so Raoul would burn 437.5 calories if he used the treadmill for 25 minutes</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>The number of calories, \(c\), burned varies directly with the amount of time, \(t\), spent exercising. Arnold burned 312 calories in 65 minutes exercising.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<p>How many calories would he burn if he exercises for 90 minutes?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(c = 432\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>The distance a moving body travels, \(d\), varies directly with time, \(t\), it moves. A train travels 100 miles in 2 hours.</li>
</ol>
<p>How many miles would it travel in 5 hours?<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 250 miles</p>

<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>For example 1, how could you find out how many minutes Raoul would need to use the treadmill to burn a certain amount of calories?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Compare your answer: Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. </p>
<p>For example: Substitute the number of calories you want to burn into the equation for \( c \), then solve for \( m \).<br>

<h3>1.14.3: Self Check</h3>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold"><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">QUESTION:</p>
<p>Sophia is making parts for a model ship. The number of parts, \(p\), she can make in a day varies directly with the number of hours, \(h\), she works. She can make 28 parts in 4 hours. How many parts would Sophia make in 9 hours?</p>

    <tr>
      <td><p>79</p></td>
      <td><p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: Recall that when multiplying to use parentheses and multiply. The correct answer is 63 parts.&nbsp;</p></td>

    <tr>
      <td><p>252</p></td>
      <td><p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: Make sure to find the constant of variation before substituting into the equation. The correct answer is 63 parts.&nbsp;</p></td>

<h4>Solve Application Problems Using Direct Variation</h4>
<p>In applications using direct variation, generally we will know values of one pair of the variables and will be asked to find the equation that relates \( x \) and \( y \). Then we can use that equation to find values of \( y \) for other values of \( x \).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how to solve applications of direct variation problems.</p>
<br>
<div class="os-raise-graybox">
  <p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Write the equation for direct variation. Identify the variables.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Substitute the given values for the variables.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Solve for the constant of variation.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Write the equation that relates \(x\) and \(y\) using the constant of variation.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 5</strong> - Substitute the value for the variable.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 6</strong> - Solve.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an application problem:</p>
<p>If the cost of a pizza varies directly with its diameter, and an 8-inch pizza costs $12, how much would a 6-inch pizza cost?</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Write the equation for direct variation. Identify the variables.<br>
  \( y = kx \)</p>
<p> \(y\): cost of pizza, \(x\): diameter</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Substitute the given values for the variables.<br>
  \(12 = k(8)\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Solve for the constant of variation.<br>
  \(k= \frac32 \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Write the equation that relates x and y using the constant of variation.<br>
  \( y= \frac{3}{2}x \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> - Substitute the value for the variable.<br>
  \( y= \frac{3}{2}(6) \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong> - Solve.<br>
  \( y = 9 \)</p>
<p>What does this mean in the context of the problem?</p>
<p>A pizza that has a diameter of 6 inches costs $9.<br>

<h4>Try It: Solve Application Problems Using Direct Variation</h4>
<p>The number of buckets of water, \(b\), filled by a spring varies directly with the number of minutes, \(m\), passed. The spring fills 3 buckets of water in 14 minutes.</p>
<p>How many buckets would be filled in 42 minutes?</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Here is how to this application problem of direct variation:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Write the equation for direct variation. Identify the variables.<br>
  \( y = kx \)<br>
  \( b=km \)</p>
<p> \(b\): number of buckets, \(m\): number of minutes</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Substitute the given values for the variables.<br>
  \( 3=k(14) \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Solve for the constant of variation.<br>
  \( k= 3/14 \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Write the equation that relates \(m\) and \(b\) using the constant of variation.<br>
  \( b= \frac{3}{14}m \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> - Substitute the value for the variable.<br>
  \( b= \frac{3}{14}(42) \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong> - Solve.<br>
  \(b= 9\) buckets</p>
