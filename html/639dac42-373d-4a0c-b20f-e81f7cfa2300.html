<h4>Determining the Meaning of Solutions of a Graphed Line</h4>
<p>Suppose we are buying beans and rice to feed a large gathering of people, and we plan to spend $120 on the two ingredients. Beans cost $2 a pound, and rice costs $0.50 a pound.<br></p>
<p>If \( x \) represents pounds of beans and \( y \) pounds of rice, the equation \( 2x + 0.50y = 120 \) can represent the constraints in this situation.</p>
<p>The graph of \( 2x + 0.50y = 120 \) shows a straight line.</p>
<div><img alt="Graph of a line. Vertical axis, pounds of rice. Horizontal axis, pounds of beans." class="atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="232" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/586a7b603355fd20cb8f01e888ce5baf39f6a9e6" width="400"><br><br></div>
<p>Each point on the line is a pair of \( x \)- and \( y \)-values that make the equation true and is thus a solution. It is also a pair of values that satisfy the constraints in the situation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The point \( (10, 200) \) is on the line. If we buy 10 pounds of beans and 200 pounds of rice, the cost will be \( 2(10) + 0.50(200) \), which equals 120.</li>
  <li>The points \( (60, 0) \) and \( (45, 60) \) are also on the line. If we buy only beans&mdash;60 pounds of them&mdash;and no rice, we will spend $120. If we buy 45 pounds of beans and 60 pounds of rice, we will also spend $120.</li>
</ul>
<p>What about points that are <em>not</em> on the line? They are not solutions because they don&rsquo;t satisfy the constraints, but they still have meaning in the situation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The point \( (20, 80) \) is not on the line. Buying 20 pounds of beans and 80 pounds of rice costs \( 2(20) + 0.50(80) \) or 80, which does not equal 120. This combination costs less than what we intend to spend.</li>
  <li>The point \( (70, 180) \) means that we buy 70 pounds of beans and 180 pounds of rice. It will cost \( 2(70)+0.50(180) \) or 230, which is over our budget of 120.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Try It: Determining the Meaning of Solutions of a Graphed Line</h4>
<p>At a high school baseball game, the
  concession stand sold hot dogs and hamburgers. Hot dogs were $1.50, and
  hamburgers cost $3. The goal is to make $150 for the game.</p>

    <p>Here is how to determine the meaning of the point \( (40, 30) \) on this
      graph. </p>
    <p>The \( x \)-axis is labeled &ldquo;number of hot
      dogs,&rdquo; and the \( y \)-axis is labeled &ldquo;number of hamburgers.&rdquo; Since
      \( x = 40\), there were 40 hot dogs sold, and since \( y = 30\), there
      were 30 hamburgers sold. Since the point is on the line, the total
      amount from the hot dogs and hamburgers sold was $150.<br></p>
