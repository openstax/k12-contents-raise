<h4>Determining the Meaning of Solutions of a Graphed Line</h4>
<p>Suppose we are buying beans and rice to feed a large gathering of people, and we plan to spend $120 on the two ingredients. Beans cost $2 a pound, and rice costs $0.50 a pound.<br></p>
<p>If&nbsp;<span>\( x \)</span>&nbsp;represents pounds of beans and&nbsp;<span>\( y \)</span>&nbsp;pounds of rice, the equation&nbsp;<span>\( 2x + 0.50y = 120 \)</span>&nbsp;can represent the constraints in this situation.</p>
<p>The graph of&nbsp;<span>\( 2x + 0.50y = 120 \)</span>&nbsp;shows a straight line.</p>
<div><img alt="Graph of a line. Vertical axis, pounds of rice. Horizontal axis, pounds of beans." class="atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="232" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/586a7b603355fd20cb8f01e888ce5baf39f6a9e6" width="400"><br><br></div>
<p>Each point on the line is a pair of&nbsp;\( x \)- and&nbsp;\( y \)-values that make the equation true and is thus a solution. It is also a pair of values that satisfy the constraints in the situation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The point&nbsp;\( (10, 200) \)&nbsp;is on the line. If we buy 10 pounds of beans and 200 pounds of rice, the cost will be&nbsp;\( 2(10) + 0.50(200) \), which equals 120.</li>
  <li>The points&nbsp;\( (60, 0) \)&nbsp;and&nbsp;\( (45, 60) \)&nbsp;are also on the line. If we buy only beans&mdash;60 pounds of them&mdash;and no rice, we will spend&nbsp;$120. If we buy 45 pounds of beans and 60 pounds of rice, we will also spend&nbsp;$120.</li>
</ul>
<p>What about points that are&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;on the line? They are not solutions because they don&rsquo;t satisfy the constraints, but they still have meaning in the situation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The point&nbsp;\( (20, 80) \)&nbsp;is not on the line. Buying 20 pounds of beans and 80 pounds of rice costs&nbsp;\( 2(20) + 0.50(80) \)&nbsp;or 80, which does not equal 120. This combination costs less than what we intend to spend.</li>
  <li>The point&nbsp;\( (70, 180) \)&nbsp;means that we buy 70 pounds of beans and 180 pounds of rice. It will cost&nbsp;\( 2(70)+0.50(180) \)&nbsp;or 230, which is over our budget of 120.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example.</p>
<p>Looking again at the graph above, would the point \((30, 120)\) be a solution, and what is the meaning in the situation?</p>
<p>Yes; the point means that 30 pounds of beans and 120 pounds of rice were purchased. Since the point is on the line, the total spent was $120.</p>

<p>At a high school baseball game, the concession stand sold hot dogs and hamburgers. Hot dogs were $1.50, and hamburgers cost $3. The goal is to make $150 for the game.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of the point \((40, 30)\) on the graph?</p>

  <p></p>Here is how to determine the meaning of the point&nbsp;\( (40, 30) \) on this graph.
  The \(&nbsp;x&nbsp;\)-axis is labeled &ldquo;number of hot dogs,&rdquo; and the \(&nbsp;y&nbsp;\)-axis is labeled &ldquo;number of hamburgers.&rdquo; Since \(&nbsp;x = 40\), there were 40 hot dogs sold, and since \(&nbsp;y = 30\), there were 30 hamburgers sold. Since the point is on the line, the total amount from the hot dogs and hamburgers sold was $150.<p></p>
