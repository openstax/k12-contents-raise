<h3>Project Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>In the activity, students will be introduced to an area model with variables. This may be a challenging step, but remind students that the side lengths in an area model have been sums up to now (ex: \(10+7\)) and an expression is just another sum. Once students have finished this activity, they should be able to make comparisons between area models with numbers and area models with variables. </p>

<h3>Launch</h3>
<p>
<li>Allow students to work independently to answer questions on their activity sheet, stopping where indicated to have small-group or whole-class discussions.</li></p>
<p><li>Circulate as students work on Part 4 of the activity sheet, noting interesting responses.</li></p>
<p><li>Notice that #1 is a repeat of the summary from part 2. Push students to reflect on their original answers. Are they similar, or has something changed about their responses? </li></p>
<p><li>For #2, if students are struggling with how to interpret this area model, encourage them to think about x as having a value. x=10 would be a simple case. This is just like when we multiplied 6✕18. </li></p>
<p><li>For #3, if students are struggling, it may help to remind them of like terms and which can be combined. </li></p>
<p><li>Students will soon work with algebra tiles to solidify these concepts, and you can always come back to the simulation to show how algebra tiles are similar to filling in an area model.</li></p>
<p><li>After you notice that individuals have finished questions through the summary, pause and bring the class together for a whole-class discussion. Allow multiple students to share their responses for #2-3 and explain their thinking. Then call on multiple students to share their ideas for the summary. </li></p>
<p><li>If there is time, allow students to try the extension and share their thinking with the class. Working backwards to factor is coming later in the unit! </li></p>

<h3>Student Activity</h3>
<h3>Part 4: Applying an Area Model </h3>

<p>Use the <em>Variables Screen</em> to answer the following questions.</p>
<p>
  1. Play around with entering your own variable expressions, then answer the following. <br>
  a. In an area model, how do the partial products (interior numbers) get calculated?<br>
  		<strong>Answer:</strong> The partial products are calculated by multiplying the number “pieces” 
  		that I have used to break up the expression into. <br>
  b. In an area model, how does the total area get calculated?<br>
  		<strong>Answer:</strong> Multiply the total side lengths together. <br>
  c.  How do the partial products relate to the total area of the area model? <br>
  		<strong>Answer:</strong> Add up all of the partial products or multiplied pieces together.
</p>

  2. Use the sim to model 6(x+8).<br>

   <strong>Answer:</strong>
   <img height="300" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/2f17385a9b80d097d97b47c7922e601dd1db83df"><br>
   What is the total area of this rectangle? Represent the total area in multiple ways. &#128172;<br>

  <strong>Answer:</strong> \(6x + 48\). The total area of this rectangle is \(6(x) + 6(8) = 6x + 48\).  
</p>

<p>
  3. Use the sim to model \((x+3)(x-5)\). <br>

  What is the total area of this rectangle? Represent the total area in multiple ways.   &#128172;<br>

  <strong>Answer:</strong>
   <img height="300" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/13ccbb30c38cb98fffc38077283ad0f30560cc09"><br><br>
   \(x^2 - 2x - 15\). The total area of this rectangle is \((x)(x) + (x)(3) + (-5)(x) + (-5)(3) 
  	= x^2 + 3x - 5x - 15 = x^2 - 2x - 15\).
</p>
<p>
  4. Challenge yourself to work through levels 1-4 of the <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/area-model-algebra/latest/area-model-algebra_en.html?screens=4" target="_blank">Area Model Algebra Game</a>! <br>
  In this challenge, students are given different rectangular scenarios that involve variables and asked to determine partial products, dimensions, etc. Students may choose their level of difficulty/challenge.
</p>


<p>5. How is multiplying variable expressions using an area model similar to multiplying numbers using an area model? <br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> In both, the total area is the product of the two factors or sides. In both, the product is found by adding the partial/interior products. In both, we can partition the factor or side in a way that is convenient for multiplication. Both use the distributive property.</p>

<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>
After you notice that individuals have finished the questions, pause and bring the class together for a whole-class discussion. Allow multiple students to share their responses for #5. Help the class notice the similarities and differences between multiplying numbers and multiplying polynomials. Be sure to highlight student thinking that stresses the comparisons to partial products and the total sum of the area of the rectangle - whether it be measured with numbers or variables.</p>
<h4>Extension</h4> 

<p>
  Challenge yourself to work backwards and factor an algebraic expression!

The Area Model sim is playing tricks on you! It gives you the partial products, but not the side lengths. What numbers and/or variables must be on the outside of this rectangle? </p>
