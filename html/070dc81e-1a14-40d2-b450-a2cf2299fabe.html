<p>Display these two sequences from an earlier lesson for all to see:</p>
<p>C: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, . . .</p>
<p>E: 20, 13, 6, &ndash;1, &ndash;8, . . .</p>
<p>Invite students to pick one of the sequences and write an equation for the nth term. If students are unsure where to start, remind them of their work writing equations for linear and exponential functions done in previous courses. Arithmetic and geometric sequences are just special types of these functions with a restricted domain. After some work time, select students to share their equations, making sure they clearly state whether they assumed the sequence started with \(n=0\) or \(n=1\). For example, an equation for \(E\) could be \(E(n)=20&minus;7(n)\) for \(n\geq0\), or it could be \(E(n)=20&minus;7(n&minus;1)\) for \(n\geq1\).</p>
