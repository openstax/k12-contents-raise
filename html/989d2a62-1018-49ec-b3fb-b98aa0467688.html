<h4>Implementation Guides</h4>
<p>This course is meant to be implemented in an environment where teachers have frequent interactions with students and their learning. As such, it is not meant to be an independent learning resource for students. Students should collaborate with each other while using the course content to explore and consolidate thoughts and responses.</p>
<p>The following guides are meant to support teachers with understanding the structure of this course and planning for the diverse needs of their students.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> Read the Unit Narrative and watch the Unit Overview video in the Unit Teacher Guide.</p>
    <p>The Unit Narrative answers the question, &ldquo;What is this unit about?&rdquo; and provides an explanation of the content that is covered in the lessons along with the reasons for how the lessons are sequenced. The video provides additional information about how many sections are contained in the unit and the learning targets students should achieve by the end of the unit. It also previews the prerequisite skills students should possess before the learning begins.</p>
    <p>A learning progression maps out the stages of learning in the unit and defines the skills students acquire in route. To conclude this step of the internalization guide, create a flowchart that depicts the learning progression of the unit.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Review the TEKS and ELPS alignments for each section of the unit.</p>
    <p>The TEKS and ELPS delineate &ldquo;What students should know and be able to do&rdquo; by the end of the unit. Unpacking the standards and comparing them to the learning targets for the unit will provide a clear destination for student learning.</p>
    <p>Draw this step to a close by identifying the &ldquo;I can&rdquo; statements students will acquire as they move through the learning progression. These &ldquo;I can&rdquo; statements should directly link to the skills defined in the standards and encapsulate levels of increasing competence.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3 - </strong>Complete the assessments in the unit.</p>
    <p>Taking the quizzes as a student will help answer, &ldquo;How will the students be asked to demonstrate what they know and are able to do?&rdquo; Begin with the Unit Quiz and STAAR Quiz, then continue with the section quizzes. Consider where each quiz is positioned along the learning progression and how the questions assess the &ldquo;I can&rdquo; statements. Blueprints for each of the assessments can be accessed in the Course Design section of the Appendix.</p>
    <p>Next, read through the Unit Project and consider how it culminates the learning for the activities and quizzes across the full breadth of the unit. The project has been positioned as an exhibition of mastery for the full learning progression.</p>
    <p>At the conclusion of this step, place the assessments on the unit&rsquo;s learning progression and identify which &ldquo;I can&rdquo; statements they assess. Reflect on the questions that may challenge students then identify areas on the learning progression where scaffolds or interventions may be needed.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 4 -</strong> Examine the Vertical Alignment Chart and video.</p>
    <p>To assist with pre-planning scaffolds or interventions, consider the question, &ldquo;What support will my students need in order to meet the learning targets?&rdquo; Required support may involve content, skills, processes, or learning strategies. Examine the Vertical Alignment Chart and video provided in the Unit Resources at the bottom of the Unit Teacher Guide. These resources clarify which challenges are rooted in prior grade levels and could help identify topics best suited for small group instruction or extensive remediation. Sections from the OpenStax PreAlgebra book aligned to the prerequisite TEKS have been provided and may be shared with students prior to the start of the unit and used during small group instruction or remediation.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 5 -</strong> Consider how to include additional tools.</p>
    <p>Additional support tools provided with the unit include Family Support Materials and Building Character.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> The Family Support Materials provide a way to include parents and guardians as part of the student&rsquo;s learning team by extending the mathematical learning environment into the home. </li>
      <li> The Building Character section provides instructional suggestions and resources teachers may use to develop students&rsquo; workplace tools and learner behaviors. </li>
    </ul>

<!-- Accordion Item #2-->
<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> Lesson Internalization Guide</button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p><strong>Optional Step -</strong> Watch the Section Overview video and read the Section Overview.</p>
    <p>The Section Overview video and narrative provide a more detailed description of the lessons contained in this section of the unit and how the lesson is positioned within the unit&rsquo;s learning progression.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> Read the lesson narrative on the Lesson Overview for the specific Lesson Teacher Guide.</p>
    <p>After accessing the Lesson Teacher Guide, read the Lesson Narrative and reflect on where it fits within the unit&rsquo;s learning progression.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Complete the Practice problems at the end of the lesson.</p>
    <p>Begin with the end in mind by working through all of the problems and questions on the Practice page. Time permitting, work through the questions in each of the Activities as well.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3 -</strong> Review the TEKS, ELPS, and learning targets of the lesson.</p>
    <p>Review and unpack the TEKS and ELPS for this lesson. Then, read the learning goals and targets for the lesson. While all of the process standards will be evident within the lesson, notice that specific ones have been highlighted since they will be the one(s) most prominently used. Additionally note that an explanation of the coverage of the TEKS is listed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Foundational coverage means the content in the lesson does not address the required rigor of the grade level TEKS but is necessary in providing access to the required expectation levels. </li>
      <li> Partial coverage means one or more of the component break outs for the TEKS has been addressed, but not all parts. </li>
      <li> Full coverage means all parts of the TEKS has been covered at the required level of rigor. </li>
      <li> There are a few activities within some lessons that have been identified as exceeding the expectations of the TEKS and noted in the Activity narrative. These activities may be used for extension and differentiation. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Step 4 -</strong> Examine the academic vocabulary terms for the lesson.</p>
    <p>Academic Vocabulary terms for the lesson have been identified and listed on the Lesson Overview page. Some terms will be familiar to students from prior lessons or courses while others will be new. Add terms to the list as appropriate to the linguistic needs of the students.</p>
    <p>Digital vocabulary cards for the full unit have been provided. Determine if and when it would be useful to share the cards with students. The cards may be printed or accessed using a variety of instructional strategies. For instance, they may be studied as flashcards or reviewed using a game format. A set has also been provided as a scaffold for emergent bilingual students labeled as newcomers or beginning level proficiency.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 5 -</strong> Read the Lesson Teacher Guide page for each primary learning activity.</p>
    <p>Each primary learning activity has three parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Activity - This section can be used as a follow-up to a mini-lesson provided by the teacher or as the mini-lesson itself. </li>
      <li> Self Check - Assesses student understanding of the mini-lesson activity. </li>
      <li> Additional Resources - Contains the direct instruction for the activity. </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>Read through the full Lesson Teacher Guide for each Activity.</p>
    <p>As the Activity and Additional Resources sections are reviewed, keep in mind that the Activity can be used as a mini-lesson or as a follow- up to teacher instruction. Then, the Additional Resources may be used as a remediation review component or for direct instruction prior to the activity. No matter which option is chosen, the Additional Resources may be utilized as an outline for the instruction needed in the activity.</p>
    <p>Read the remaining sections of the Lesson Teacher Guide for each activity. Pay special attention to the Launch, Anticipated Misconceptions, and Activity Synthesis sections.</p>
    <p>If not already completed, work through all of the questions in the activities at this time.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 6 -</strong> Complete the Warm Up and Cool Down activities for the lesson.</p>
    <p>After completing these questions, reflect on how they frame the lesson as opening and closure activities.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 7 -</strong> Plan how to use the Activities and needed mini-lessons.</p>
    <p>After reading through all parts of the Lesson Teacher Guide, make annotations or develop a plan for how each of the activities will be used. Consider the suggestions provided in the Supports for English Language Learners and Supports for Students with Disabilities. Identify the specific differentiation strategies needed for the students currently in this course.</p>
    <p>Take into consideration how each Activity should be introduced (Launch section) and drawn to a close (Activity Synthesis section).</p>
    <p>Create any mini-lessons, pre-plan small group instruction activities, and prepare for how to gather data as students work through the activities.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 8 -</strong> Determine time allotments for each portion of the lesson.</p>
    <p>Use the suggested timings provided on the Lesson Teacher Guide to finalize time allotments for each activity in the lesson. The suggestions provided equate to class periods of 45 - 60 minutes. Adjust accordingly based on alternative time schedules or needed differentiation.</p>
    <p>Assign student groups and arrange the room as needed.</p>
