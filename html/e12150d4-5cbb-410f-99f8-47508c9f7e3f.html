<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>This opening lesson introduces students to performing operations on expressions with exponents. They will start by
  representing exponents as repeated multiplication to reinforce the meaning of exponents. Students will use the Product
  and Quotient Properties for Exponents when multiplying and dividing expressions with exponents.</p>
<p>Students will learn to simplify expressions that have a zero as an exponent, in addition to expressions with negative
  exponents. They will use the Power Property for Exponents to simplify expressions that raise a power to a power.
  Students will also use the Product to a Power Property and Quotient to a Power Property to simplify expressions in
  which the entire product or quotient is raised to a power.</p>
<p>In subsequent lessons, students will continue using exponents to explore exponential growth and decay.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Simplify expressions by adding the exponents of bases that are being multiplied and subtracting the exponents of
    bases that are being divided. </li>
  <li> Simplify any base with an exponent of zero to a value of \(1\). </li>
  <li> Simplify expressions with negative exponents by taking the reciprocal of the base and changing the sign of the
    exponent. </li>
  <li> Distribute an exponent through a multiplication or division expression using relevant exponent properties. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Simplify expressions using different properties for exponents. </li>
  <li> Simplify expressions containing exponents of zero. </li>
  <li> Use the definition of a negative exponent to simplify expressions. </li>
</ul>

<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are
  only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.
  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p>
<ul>
  <li>ELPS 1(F) use accessible language and learn new and essential language in the process</li>
  <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and
    reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
  <li>ELPS 3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions</li>
</ul>
