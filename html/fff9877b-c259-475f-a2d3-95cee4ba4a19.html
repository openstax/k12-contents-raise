<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>Seniors in a high school student council are trying to develop a budget for the Senior Dance. The revenue from ticket sales needs to cover the cost of the meals and entertainment and also make a profit of at least $200 to be contributed to the school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is some information they have gathered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Last year, 120 people attended. It was a success and is expected to be even bigger this year. Up to 200 people will attend.</li>
<li>There needs to be at least 1 chaperone for every 20 students.</li>
<li>The ticket price cannot exceed $20 per person.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your answers may vary, but here are some sample responses to compare your answers.</p>
<p>Sample response (an interpretation of the meaning of each letter and an interpretation of the mathematical statement are included):</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>\( t &le; 20 \) means that the ticket price, \( t \), must be less than or equal to $20.</li>
<li>\( 120 &le; p &le; 200 \) means that between 120 and 200 people are expected to attend (120 is less than or equal to the number of people; the number of people is less than or equal to 200). \( p \) represents the number of people attending the dance.</li>
<li>\( pt &minus; m &ge; 200 \) means that the total amount collected from ticket sales in dollars, \( pt \), minus the cost of meals and entertainment in dollars, \( m \), must be greater than or equal to $200.</li>
<li>\( c \geq \frac{p}{20} \) means that the number of chaperones, \( c \), must be at least \( \frac{1}{20} \) of the number of students attending.</li>

<li>We can't have a negative ticket price.</li>
<li>By the same reasoning we might want to include \(m\;\geq\;0\). Note that the other variables should also be greater than or equal to 0, but those conditions are already implied by the existing constraints.</li>
