<p>Display the equation \(25x^2&minus;50x+16=0\) for all to see. Ask students how they prefer to solve it (by rewriting the expression in factored form, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula) and why. Then, ask them to solve the equation using their preferred method.</p>
<p>Possible explanations for the different methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Rewriting in factored form: The equation can be rewritten as \((5x&minus;8)(5x&minus;2)=0\) and solved using the zero product property. </li>
  <li> Completing the square: \(25x^2&minus;50x+25\) is a perfect square, so we can just add 9 to either side of the original equation and find the square root of 9. </li>
  <li> The quadratic formula, because it always works. </li>
</ul>
<p>The solutions (by any method) are \(\frac25\) and \(\frac85\).</p>
