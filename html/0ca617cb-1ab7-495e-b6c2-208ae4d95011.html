<h4>Linear Equations and Their Representations</h4>
<p>Linear equations can be written from situations, tables of values, and graphs.</p>
<p> Here is a linear situation:</p>
<p>Sadie pays $15 a month for ballet classes plus $5 each lesson she takes.</p>
<p>First, make a table of values to represent how much Sadie pays for the first 5 lessons.</p>
<table class="os-raise-horizontaltable">
  <thead>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Number of Lessons</th>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Total Cost</th>
      <td>15</td>
      <td>20</td>
      <td>25</td>
      <td>30</td>
      <td>35</td>
      <td>40</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<p>Next, graph all of the points:</p>

<p>Looking at the slope and \(y\)-intercepts of the table and graph, write an equation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Identify the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p>When \(x = 0\), \(y = 15\) so the \(y\)-intercept is 15.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Identify the slope.</p>
<p>Slope is the change in \(y\) over the change in \(x\). For this table, the change in \(y\) is 43 and the change in \(x\) is 1. The slope is 3.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Write the equation in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p>In the slope-intercept form, \(y=mx+b\), \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p>The equation is \(y = 5x+15\).</p>

<p>Here is how to write an equation from a table.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Identify the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p>When \(x = 0\), \(y = 7\) so the \(y\)-intercept is 7.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Identify the slope.</p>
<p>Slope is the change in \(y\) over the change in \(x\). For this table, the change in \(y\) is 4 and the change in \(x\) is 1. The slope is 4.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Write the equation in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p>In the slope-intercept form, \(y=mx+b\), \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p>The equation is \(y = 4x +7\).</p>
