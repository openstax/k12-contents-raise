  real-life situations require us to use inequalities. Translating the
  details of these situations into inequalities is the first step in
  understanding them. Let&rsquo;s look at how we can translate these situations
  into mathematical sentences.<br></span><br>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imani won a mini-grant of $4,000 to buy tablet computers for her classroom.
  The tablets she would like to buy cost $254.12 each, including tax and
  delivery. She can only spend up to the amount of the mini-grant.</p>
<p>Choose a variable to represent the quantity of tablet computers:</p>
<div>
  <p>Let \( n \) = the number of tablets.</p>
</div>
<p>Translate: Write a sentence that gives the information provided.</p>
<div>
  <p>$254.12 times the number of tablets is no more than $4,000.</p>
</div>
<p>Translate into an inequality:</p>
<div>
  <p>\( 254.12n &lt; 4000 \)</p>
</div>
<p>Imani&rsquo;s situation is represented by the inequality \(254.12n &lt; 4000\).</p>
<p><strong>Example 2&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Taleisha&rsquo;s phone plan costs her $28.80 a month plus $0.20 per text message. Her monthly bill can be no more than $50.</p>
<p>Choose a variable to represent the quantity of text messages:</p>
<div>
  <p>Let \( t \) = the number of text messages.</p>
</div>
<p>Translate: Write a sentence that gives the information provided.</p>
<div>
  <p>$28.80 plus $0.20 times the number of text messages is less than or equal to $50.</p>
</div>
<p>Translate into an inequality:</p>
<div>
  <p>\( 28.80 + 0.20t &lt; 50 \)</p>
</div>
<p>Taleisha&rsquo;s situation is represented by the inequality \( 28.80 + 0.20t &lt; 50 \).</p>
