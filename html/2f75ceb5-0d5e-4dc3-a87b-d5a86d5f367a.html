    <p>Summarize the lesson by discussing students' work for the last activity (about bank accounts, concert tickets, and advertising packages) and inviting them to reflect on their reasoning process. Discuss questions such as:</p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Of the four things you were asked to do in the last activity-writing an inequality, graphing the solutions, identifying and interpreting a particular solution, and answering the question about the situation-which one did you find most challenging or prone to error?"</li>
      <li>"How is graphing linear inequalities using technology similar to graphing them by hand? How is it different?"</li>
      <li>"You have previously used technology to graph linear equations in two variables. How is graphing linear inequalities in two variables different than graphing equations?"</li>
    </ul>
