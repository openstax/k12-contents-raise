<p>Summarize the lesson by discussing students' work for the first activity (about bank accounts, concert tickets, and advertising packages) and inviting them to reflect on their reasoning process. Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Of the four things you were asked to do in the first activity-writing an inequality, graphing the solutions, identifying and interpreting a particular solution, and answering the question about the situation-which one did you find most challenging or prone to error?"</li>
  <li>"How is graphing linear inequalities using technology similar to graphing them by hand? How is it different?"</li>
  <li>"You have previously used technology to graph linear equations in two variables. How is graphing linear inequalities in two variables different than graphing equations?"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
