<h4>Lesson Narrative&nbsp;</h4>
<p>This lesson continues to examine quantities that change exponentially, focusing on a quantity that decays or decreases. Students examine more situations with quantities that decrease exponentially. They work from an equation to a graph and from a graph to an equation. In both cases, they interpret the different parts of their equation in terms of the situation and use the graph to answer questions.</p>
<p>Like many activities in this unit, the equations and graphs represent actual quantities (the area covered by algae and the amount of insulin in a person&rsquo;s body) and are to be interpreted in context. They also use discrete graphs to depict measurements of quantities that vary continuously over time and answer questions using these graphs. In the following lessons, we will represent situations where the domain is all real numbers with a continuous graph.</p>
<p>One activity encourages students to view a quantity that decreases by a factor of itself using multiplication rather than subtraction. If a computer costs $500 and loses \(\frac15\) of its value each year, after one year we could write this, in dollars, as \(500&minus;(\frac{1}{5}) \cdot 500\). But if we write this using multiplication, as \(500\cdot (\frac{4}{5})\), then we are in a better position to see that after 2 years its value in dollars will be \(500 \cdot (\frac{4}{5}) \cdot (\frac{4}{5})\), and after \(t\) years, the value will be \(500 \cdot (\frac{4}{5})^t\). In other words, exponents are a particularly useful way to express repeated loss by a factor of the original amount. Students will carry this understanding into future lessons that deal with repeated percentage change situations.</p>
<p>Technology isn&rsquo;t required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems. We recommend making technology available.</p>
