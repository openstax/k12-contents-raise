<h4>Lesson Narrative&nbsp;</h4>
<p>This lesson continues to examine quantities that change exponentially, focusing on a quantity that decays or
  decreases. Students examine more situations with quantities that decrease exponentially. They work from an equation to
  a graph and from a graph to an equation. In both cases, they interpret the different parts of their equation in terms
  of the situation and use the graph to answer questions.</p>
<p>Like many activities in this unit, the equations and graphs represent actual quantities (the area covered by algae
  and the amount of insulin in a person&rsquo;s body) and are to be interpreted in context. They also use discrete
  graphs to depict measurements of quantities that vary continuously over time and answer questions using these graphs.
  In the following lessons, we will represent situations where the domain is all real numbers with a continuous graph.
</p>
<p>One activity encourages students to view a quantity that decreases by a factor of itself using multiplication rather
  than subtraction. If a computer costs $500 and loses \(\frac15\) of its value each year, after one year we could write
  this, in dollars, as \(500&minus;(\frac{1}{5}) \cdot 500\). But if we write this using multiplication, as \(500\cdot
  (\frac{4}{5})\), then we are in a better position to see that after 2 years its value in dollars will be \(500 \cdot
  (\frac{4}{5}) \cdot (\frac{4}{5})\), and after \(t\) years, the value will be \(500 \cdot (\frac{4}{5})^t\). In other
  words, exponents are a particularly useful way to express repeated loss by a factor of the original amount. Students
  will carry this understanding into future lessons that deal with repeated percentage change situations.</p>
<p>Technology isn&rsquo;t required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use
  appropriate technology to solve problems. We recommend making technology available.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Comprehend that the term &ldquo;exponential growth&rdquo; describes a quantity that changes by a growth factor
    that is greater than 1, and the term &ldquo;exponential decay&rdquo; describes a quantity that changes by a growth
    factor that is less than 1 but greater than 0. </li>
