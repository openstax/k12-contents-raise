<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<p>Ask students to put away their devices for the cool down.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>A quadratic function is defined by the expression \(x^2&minus;20x+19\).</p>
<p>Rewrite the expression in vertex form (of a quadratic expression) and give the coordinates of the vertex (of a graph). Show your reasoning.</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \((x&minus;10)^2&minus;81\). The vertex is at \((10, -81)\).</p>
<p>\(x^2&minus;20x+19\)<br>
	\(x^2&minus;20x+100+19&minus;100\)<br>
	\(x^2&minus;20x+100&minus;81\)<br>
	\((x&minus;10)^2&minus;81\)</p>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize in 9.9 to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
