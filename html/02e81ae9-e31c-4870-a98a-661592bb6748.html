<h4>The Meaning of Values on a Graph</h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say a tennis ball is hit straight up in the air, and its height in feet above the ground is modeled by the equation \(f(t)=4+12t&minus;16t^2\) where \(t\) represents the time in seconds after the ball is hit. Here is a graph that represents the function, from the time the tennis ball was hit until the time it reached the ground.</p>

<p>In the graph, we can see some information we already know, and some new information:</p>
<ul>
<li> The 4 in the equation means the graph of the function intersects the vertical axis at 4. It shows that the tennis ball was 4 feet off the ground at \(t=0\), when it was hit. </li>
<li> The horizontal intercept is \((1,0)\). It tells us that the tennis ball hit the ground 1 second after it was hit. </li>
<li> The vertex of the graph is at approximately \((0.4,6.3)\). This means that about 0.4 second after the ball was hit, it reached the maximum height of about 6.3 feet. </li>
</ul>
<p>The equation can be written in factored form as \(f(t)=(-16t&minus;4)(t&minus;1)\). From this form, we can see that the zeros of the function are \(t=1\) and \(t=-14\). The negative zero, -14, is not meaningful in this situation because the time before the ball was hit is irrelevant.</p>
<h4>Try It: The Meaning of Values on a Graph</h4>
<p>An object is thrown upward from a height of 5 feet with a velocity of 60 feet per second. Its height h(t) in feet after \(t\) seconds is modeled by the function \(h(t)=5+60t-16t^2\) and graphed below.</p>

<p>Here is how to determine the \(y\)-intercept:</p>
<p>The vertical intercept, or \(y\)-intercept, is where the graph crosses the \(y\)-axis. It occurs when \(x=0\). You can also identify the \(y\)-intercept by looking at the constant in the function. This occurs at \(y=5\). The point is (0,5). The \(y\)-intercept represents the initial height. It means the object is thrown from 5 feet above the ground.</p>
