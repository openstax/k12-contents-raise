<h3>
  Activity (15 minutes)<br>
</h3>
<p>The mathematical purpose of this activity is for students to create a scatter plot from data given in context, to informally find a line they think does a good job of describing the relationship, to interpret the slope and vertical intercept of the linear model, and to use the linear model to make predictions. In creating a model of the data, students are modeling with mathematics.</p>
<p>This activity works best when each student has access to devices that can run Desmos or other graphing technology because the level of precision is important. If students don&rsquo;t have individual access, projecting the Desmos graph is helpful during the synthesis.</p>
<p>Note that students may need a quick review of finding slope and \(y\)-intercepts from graphs and slope-intercept form as well as a review of finding slope using the slope formula.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Play the video of adding oranges to a box on a scale. You may need to pause the video for students to write down the weights.</p>
<div class="os-raise-graybox">
  <h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>
  <p><em>Representation: Internalize Comprehension. </em>Begin the activity with concrete or familiar contexts to address the questions about estimation. Ask students to make predictions about similar scenarios that may become more variable as the sample size increases. For example, discussing the predictability of the weight of a box of fruit as a given sample size increases may be a relatable discussion that will encourage students to think about the difference between a grape and a grapefruit.</p>

  <li>For example: About 10.6 kilograms \((2.6+40&sdot;0.2=10.6)\). This estimate will probably not be very close. With data only going to 10 oranges, the variability in orange weight with more oranges will make it harder to get an estimate that is close to the actual value.<br><br></li>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may struggle with estimating a slope when the scales on the \(x\)- and \(y\)-axes are different. Ask students to find the coordinates for a couple of points on or near the line and find the slope between those points.</p>

<p>Tell students to keep this data and scatter plot for a future lesson.</p>
<p>Ask:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;How would the scatter plot and linear model change if the box itself were heavier?&rdquo; (The dots and line would shift up.)<br></li>
  <li>&ldquo;Can you think of reasons why the real weight of 50 oranges might be different from the answer we get by using an estimate from the linear model?&rdquo; (50 oranges may not fit in one box, so additional boxes may be needed, which will change the linear pattern in the data. Many of the additional oranges may be very small or very large and not fit the general trend seen with these 10 oranges. While the estimate from the line is interesting and may be better than a wild guess, it should not be considered a very good estimate.)<br></li>
  <li>&ldquo;How many oranges did we measure?&rdquo; (10)<br></li>
  <li>&ldquo;Since we measured 10 oranges, how does that affect your confidence in the estimate for 50 oranges?&rdquo; (It makes me very skeptical that the estimate will be accurate. Although the data may look like a line for this section, there may be very different things happening farther away.)<br></li>
  <li>&ldquo;How would the scatter plot and linear model change if grapefruits were used instead of oranges?&rdquo; (The weight would be increased for each point, and the slope of the line would be greater.)<br></li>
  <li>&ldquo;In this case, there might be some meaning attached to the \(y\)-intercept. That is not always the case. Why might interpreting the \(y\)-intercept not make sense in some situations? Can you think of a situation in which an interpretation of the \(y\)-intercept might not make sense?&rdquo; (As you get farther from the collected data, the linear model may not make sense any more. Especially in situations in which the amount of something is approaching zero, very different things can be happening. For example, if we have data about water at temperatures around 60 to 70 degrees, that will be very different from what happens when the temperature is at 0.)</li>

<h4>Drawing and Interpreting Scatter Plots</h4>
<p>A scatter plot is a graph of plotted points that may show a relationship between two sets of data. If the relationship is from a linear model or from a model that is nearly linear, the professor can draw conclusions using his knowledge of linear functions.<br></p>
<p>Here is an example of a scatter plot.<br></p>
<p><strong><img alt="Scatter plot, titled 'Final Exam Score VS Age'. The x-axis is the age, and the y-axis is the final exam score. The range of ages are between 20s - 50s, and the range for scores are between upper 50s and 90s." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="337" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/d85e87d6a305be35528f5ab89b201056fdbe8d53" width="487"></strong><br></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-b999d02d-7fff-8cf4-2683-336bed48daff">Notice this scatter plot does not indicate a linear relationship. The points do not appear to follow a trend. In other words, there does not appear to be a relationship between the age of the student and the score on the final exam.</p>

<p>Plotting these data suggests that there may be a trend. We can see from the trend in the data that as the number of chirps in 15 seconds increases, the temperature increases. The trend appears to be roughly linear, though certainly not perfectly so.</p>
<img alt="Scatter plot, titled 'Cricket Chirps vs. Air Temperature'. The x-axis is the Cricket Chirps in 15 Seconds, and the y-axis is the Temperature (F). The line regression is generally positive." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/0bd821366e09c7df8ba83f57a8b07d4aa8fb15aa" width="350"><br>
<p>Once we recognize a need for a linear function to model that data, the natural follow-up question is: &ldquo;What is that linear function?&rdquo; One way to approximate our linear function is to sketch the line that seems to best fit the data. Then we can extend the line until we can verify the \(y\)-intercept. We can approximate the slope of the line by extending it until we can estimate the \( \frac{rise}{run}\).</p>
<p><strong>Continuing the Example: Finding a Line of Best Fit</strong></p>
<p>Find a linear function that fits the data above by &ldquo;eyeballing&rdquo; a line that seems to fit.</p>
<p>On a graph, we could try sketching a line. Using the starting and ending points of our hand-drawn line, points \((0, 30)\) and \((50, 90)\), this graph has a slope of \(m\;=\;\frac{60}{50}\;=\;1.2\) and a \(y\)-intercept at 30.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The slope means that for every increase of 1 chirp per 15 seconds, the temperature increases 1.2 degrees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The \(y\)-intercept stands for the temperature needed for crickets to start chirping.</p>
<img alt class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="319" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/af5cb1df7596f0f7e8780c763b3c3d22072ada74" width="350">

<p>Different methods of making predictions are used to analyze data. The method of interpolation involves predicting a value inside the domain and/or range of the data. The method of extrapolation involves predicting a value outside the domain and/or range of the data.</p>
<p>Model breakdown occurs at the point when the model no longer applies.</p>
<p><strong>Continuing the Example: Understanding Interpolation and Extrapolation</strong></p>
<p>Use the cricket data from the table to answer the following questions:<br></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
    <li>Would predicting the temperature when crickets are chirping 30 times in 15 seconds be interpolation or extrapolation? Make the prediction, and discuss whether it is reasonable.</li>
    <li>Would predicting the number of chirps crickets will make at 40 degrees be interpolation or extrapolation? Make the prediction, and discuss whether it is reasonable.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Solution:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
  <li>The number of chirps in the data provided varied from 18.5 to 44. A prediction at 30 chirps per 15 seconds is inside the domain of our data, so it would be interpolation. Using our model:</li>
</ol>
<div class="editor-indent">
  <p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}T\;(30)\;&amp;=&amp;\;30\;+\;1.2(30)\\&amp;=&amp;\;66\;degrees\end{array}\)&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>Based on the data we have, this value seems reasonable.</p><br>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2" type="a">
  <li>The temperature values varied from 52 to 80.5. Predicting the number of chirps at 40 degrees is extrapolation because 40 is outside the range of our data. Using our model:</li>
</ol>
<div class="editor-indent">
  <p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}40\;&amp;=&amp;\;30\;+\;1.2c\\10\;&amp;=&amp;\;1.2c\\c\;&amp;\approx&amp;\;8.33\end{array}\)</p>
</div>
<p>We can compare the regions of interpolation and extrapolation using the following figure.</p>

<h4>Try It: Drawing and Interpreting Scatter Plots</h4>
<p>The scatter plot below shows the height and speed of some of the world&rsquo;s fastest roller coasters. A linear model was drawn to fit the data.</p>
<img alt="A SCATTER PLOT THAT SHOWS MAXIMUM HEIGHT IN FEET ON THE X-AXIS AND SPEED IN MILES PER HOUR ON THE Y-AXIS. THE LINE DRAWN INCREASES FROM LEFT TO RIGHT." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="309" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/0a1dcda7b995c59f5ccb90cf336b760df09a80bb" width="350"><br>
<p>What would you expect the speed to be for a roller coaster that is 350 feet tall?</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to find the estimate of the speed:<br></p>
<p>Looking at the linear model, when the height on the \(x\)-axis is 350 feet, the value meets the line at approximately 98 mph. Since this is an estimate, you may have an answer close to 98, but it should be closer to 100 mph than 95 mph based on the graph.<br></p>
