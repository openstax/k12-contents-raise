<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here is someone's solution to the equation \(3x^2&minus;4x=20\).</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  \(3x^2&minus;4x=20\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  \(a=3\), \(b=-4\), \(c=20\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  \(x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2- 4ac}}{2a}\)</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  \(x=\frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2- (4)(3)(20)}}{2(3)}\)</p>
<p>Step 5<br>
  \(x=\frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{-16-240}}{6}\)</p>
<p>Step 6<br>
  \(x=\frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{-256}}{6}\)</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> \(b\) is -4, so in Step 4, the value \(-b\) should be -(-4), which is 4. </li>
  <li> In Step 1, the equation should be rewritten as \(ax^2+bx+c=0\), so the constant term \(c\) is -20, not 20. So, in Step 4, the last part of the numerator should be \(\sqrt{(-4)^2-4(3)(-20)}\). </li>
  <li> In Step 4, \((-4)^2\) should be 16. Squaring a negative number gives a positive number. </li>
  <li> If the earlier issues were fixed, then the values under the square root symbol would be \(16+240\) or 256. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>Points to Emphasize</h5>
<p>Use student work from this cool down and the last cool down to highlight common errors that students are making or not identifying as errors.</p>
