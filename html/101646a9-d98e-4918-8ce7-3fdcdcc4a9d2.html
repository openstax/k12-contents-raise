<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">&ldquo;How are they different?&rdquo; (The first set of graphs shows two regions that overlap, bounded by dotted lines. The second set shows two intersecting lines, and the lines are solid. One set represents the solutions to a system of linear inequalities.)</p>

<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">&ldquo;How can we tell the number of solutions from each set of graphs?&rdquo; (The graphs representing a system of equations shows one point of intersection, so there is only one solution. The graphs representing a system of inequalities show one region of overlap, but there are many points in that region. This means that there are many solutions.)</p>
