<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Identify the vertex of the graph of a quadratic function when the expression that defines it is written in vertex form. </li>
  <li> Explain the meaning of the term "vertex form" and recognize examples of quadratic expressions written in this form. </li>
  <li> When given a quadratic expression in factored form, rewrite it in standard form. </li>
  <li> When given a quadratic expression in standard form, rewrite it in vertex form. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> 9.10.1: The Vertex and Intercepts of a Function
    <ul>
      <li> In this activity, you determined the vertex, the \(x\)-intercepts, and the \(y\)-intercept for three different expressions that represent the same function. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> 9.10.2: Expanding from Factored Form to Standard Form
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you rewrote expressions that were in factored form into standard form. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 9.10.3: Converting from Standard Form to Vertex Form
    <ul>
      <li> In this activity, you rewrote two expressions that were in vertex form into standard form. </li>
      <li> 9.10.3: Self Check </li>
      <li> 9.10.3: Additional Resources </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> 9.10.4: Rewriting Expressions in Vertex Form
    <ul>
      <li> In this activity, you transformed expressions, whose squared term had a coefficient other than 1, into vertex form. </li>
      <li> 9.10.4: Self Check </li>
      <li> 9.10.4: Additional Resources </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> 9.10.5: Different Forms of Quadratic Expressions
    <ul>
      <li> In this optional activity, you wrote expressions in vertex form and factored form that could define a quadratic function. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> 9.10.6: Vertex Form and Coordinates of the Vertex
    <ul>
      <li> In this activity, you wrote an expression in vertex form and found the coordinates of the vertex. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
