    <p></p>
  </div>
  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-ack">
    <p></p>
    <p><span lang="EN">The answer is C because there is little to no correlation or relationship between the daily low temperature in Denver, CO and the amount of cereal stocked in Miami, FL. The scatterplot in graph C most closely depicts a relationship that is not correlated since the points do not cluster along a line or curve. </span><span lang="EN"></span></p>

  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-ack">
    <p></p>
    <p><span lang="EN">The answer is B because a positive correlation exists. That is, when the number of attempted free throws increases, then the team score will increase. While this is a strong likelihood, there are other factors that impact the score such as the number of free throws actually scored, the number of three-point shots scored, the number of two-point shots scored, etc. These other possible factors introduce variablity among the points and with the line of best fit.

    <p></p>
  </div>
  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-ack">
    <p></p>
    <p><span lang="EN">The answer is A because as a personâ€™s height measured in inches increases, the height measured in feet also increases and results in a positive correlation. Since the conversion factor from inches to feet does not vary, the scatterplot tightly clusters on the line of best fit.

    <p></p>
  </div>
  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-ack">
    <p></p>
    <p><span lang="EN">The answer is D because there is a negative correlation between the two variables. That is, tthe longer someone waits in a waiting room, the lower the satisfaction rating for the hospital that could be reported. However, this negative correlation is not tightly clustered along a line of best fit because there are other factors that will impact the satisfaction rating such as staff friendliness, cleanliness of the facility, doctors bedside manner, etc.</span><span lang="EN"></span></p>
