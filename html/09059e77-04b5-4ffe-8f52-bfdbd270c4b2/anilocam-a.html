<p dir="ltr">In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Explain how to tell if a point on the boundary of the graph of the solutions to a system of inequalities is a solution.
  </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>

    <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">2.15.1: Analyzing Graphs that Represent Linear Equations and Inequalities</p>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In this activity, you carefully analyzed and compared graphs that represent linear equations and inequalities. Making comparisons prompted you to think about the solutions to the equations, inequalities, or systems that were represented. It also gave you an opportunity to use language precisely.

  <li>
    2.15.2: Determining if Points on Boundary Lines Are Solutions to a System
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In this activity, you took a closer look at whether points that are on the boundary lines are solutions to the system.

    2.15.3: Solving Problems to Satisfy Multiple Constraints Simultaneously
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In this activity, you had an opportunity to use your understanding of systems of linear inequalities to solve problems that involve satisfying multiple constraints simultaneously.
