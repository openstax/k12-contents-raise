<p>In this lesson, you will learn how the parameters and variables relate to features of the graphs of two-variable linear equations. In addition, you will think about how different forms of two-variable equations affect the information we could gain about the relationships between the quantities and about the graphs.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Describe the connections between an equation of the form&nbsp;\( ax+by=c \), the features of its graph, and the rate of change in the situation.</li>
  <li>Graph linear equations of the form&nbsp;\( ax+by=c \).</li>
  <li>Demonstrate that rewriting the equation for a line in different forms can make it easier to find certain kinds of information about the relationship and about the graph.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities </strong>that will help you reach those goals</p>
