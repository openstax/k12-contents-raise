<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>The solutions to this equation are \(x = \frac{3}{4}\) and \(x=\frac{1}{4}\). Show how to find those solutions by completing the square. \(x^2&minus;x+\frac{3}{16}=0\)</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}x^2-x+\frac3{16}&amp;=&amp;0\\x^2-x+\frac14&amp;=&amp;-\frac3{16}+\frac14=-\frac3{16}+\frac4{16}=\frac1{16}\\x^2-x+\frac14&amp;=&amp;\frac1{16}\\\sqrt{\left(x-\frac12\right)^2}&amp;=&amp;\sqrt{\frac1{16}}\\x-\frac12&amp;=&amp;\pm\frac14\\x-\frac12&amp;=&amp;\frac14\\x-\frac12&amp;=&amp;-\frac14\end{array}\)<br> \( \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;x=\frac{1}{4} \text { and } x=\frac{3}{4}\) </p>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
