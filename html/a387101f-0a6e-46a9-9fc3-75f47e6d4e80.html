<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>Prior to this course, students learned that an object traveling at a constant speed can be described with a linear function whose graph is a straight line. Here, they see a model that accounts for the fact that an object that is launched straight up at a constant speed does not keep going at the same rate when the influence of gravity is taken into account. Adding a quadratic term to a linear function has an effect of &ldquo;bending&rdquo; the graph, as the output values are no longer changing at a constant rate.</p>
<p>If students are unsure how to write an equation to represent the values in the table, ask them to compare how the actual heights of the cannonball at each second (when \(t\) is 1, 2, 3, etc.) differ from those in the no-gravity case (as shown in the table in the warm up). Finding the differences between the two outputs (16, 64, 144 . . .) at the same input values should help students think of the numbers and the functions they saw in the previous lesson.</p>
<p>To generalize the relationship between time and distance, students reason repeatedly with numerical values and look for regularity. If students opt to use a spreadsheet or graphing technology, they practice choosing appropriate tools strategically.</p>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Give students a minute of quiet time to think about the first question, and then time to share their observations with their partner. Tell students that they will need to reference their work in the warm up.</p>
<p>Some students may choose to use a spreadsheet tool to extend the pattern, and subsequently to use graphing technology to plot the data. Make these tools accessible, in case requested.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Earlier, in activity 7.6.1, you completed a table that represents the height of a cannonball, in feet, as a function of time, in seconds, if there was no gravity.</p>
<p>This table shows the actual heights of the ball at different times.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li> The actual height values are all less than the hypothetical ones (except the first, before the cannonball has been fired). </li>
  <li> The difference between the distances after some number of seconds is not constant. For example, 1 second after firing, the distances in the two tables are 416 and 400, a difference of 16 feet. Two seconds after firing, the difference between the two values is 64 feet. </li>

<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The dots (triangles) that form a straight line represent the hypothetical data that ignore gravity. The dots that form a curve represent the actual heights. They both start at the same place (0,10). The hypothetical data show the heights increasing at a constant rate, in a linear pattern, while the actual data show values growing more slowly each successive second.</p>

  <li>What was the constant rate of change for the cannonball without gravity?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> 406
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The constant rate of change is also the initial velocity. Recall that the effect of gravity is represented by \(16t^2\). Gravity causes the bend in the curve for the second table and graph because it pulls the cannonball down toward the ground.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>With a partner, write an equation to model the actual distance \(d\), in feet, of the ball \(t\) seconds after it was fired from the cannon. Consider gravity and how the points changed on the graph.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> Notice that gravity caused the heights to decrease, so, the effect of gravity is to subtract \(16t^2\). An equation for the actual height of the cannonball is \(d=10+406t-16t^2\).
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>When comparing the tables, some students may make observations that lack the detail needed to write an equation for the actual height. Prompt them to rewrite the outputs for the actual height in terms of the hypothetical height (\(400=416-16\), \(758=822-64\), \(1084=1228-144\), and so on). Show them values of \(16t^2\) from a previous lesson to help them see and extend the pattern to write the equation.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their observations about the two tables (the one from the warm up and the one here) and how the two graphs compare. Highlight responses that suggest that the values in the second table account for the effect of gravity.</p>
<p>Help students see how the output for each \(t\)-value varies across the two tables. When \(t\) is 1, the output in feet in the second table is 16 less than in the first table. When \(t\) is 2, there is a difference of 64 feet. When \(t\) is 3, that difference is 144 feet, and so on. The values 16, 64, 144 . . . correspond to the expression \(16t^2\) that we saw in the previous lesson (the distance fallen in feet as a function of time in seconds), so we can represent the values in the second table with the equation \(d=10+406t-16t^2\). Ask students:</p>
<ul>
  <li> &ldquo;What do the 10, \(406t\), and \(-16t^2\) mean in this situation?&rdquo; (The 10 is the vertical position of the cannonball before it was launched: 10 feet above ground. In \(406t\), the 406 tells us the vertical velocity at which it was shot up. The \(-16t^2\) accounts for the effect of gravity on the height of the cannonball after it was shot up.) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;Why do you think the graph that represents \(d=10+406t\) changes from a straight line to a curve when \(-16t^2\) is added to the equation?&rdquo; (Before that term was added, the height increased by 406 feet every second. Adding \(-16t^2\) decreases how much the cannonball travels up by some amount, but that amount gets larger each successive second. Eventually, the cannonball stops increasing in height and starts to fall.) </li>
</ul>
