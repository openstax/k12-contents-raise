<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2.13.1: Graphing Inequalities with Technology
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you used graphing technology to graph simple linear inequalities in two variables. You practiced adjusting the graphing window until the solution regions become visible and give useful information.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>2.13.2: Solving Problems with Inequalities in Two Variables
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you integrated several ideas and skills from the past few lessons. You wrote inequalities in two variables to represent constraints in situations, used technology to graph the solutions, interpreted points in the solution regions, and used the inequalities and the graphs to answer contextual questions.</li>
      <li>2.13.2: Self Check</li>
      <li>2.13.2: Additional Resources</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>2.13.3: Matching Representations of Inequalities
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you practiced interpreting inequalities in context and reasoning about your solutions graphically and numerically. This sorting and matching task gave you opportunities to analyze representations, statements, and structures closely and to make connections.</li>
