<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Factor perfect square trinomials. </li>
  <li> Factor differences of squares. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 6.6.1: Identifying Perfect Square Trinomials </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you learned how to recognize perfect square trinomials. They always follow a pattern of \(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\) or \(a^2 &minus; 2ab + b^2\). </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 6.6.2: Factoring Perfect Square Trinomials </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you learned how to factor perfect square trinomials. You can recognize that they will always factor to a form of \((a + b)^2\) or \((a &minus; b)^2\). In some cases, you first need to factor the GCF out of the existing terms. </li>
    <li> 6.6.2: Self Check </li>
    <li>6.6.2: Additional Resources</li>
  </ul>
  <li> 6.6.3: Factoring the Difference of Squares </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you learned how to factor using the difference of squares. In these problems, the middle term will always cancel to the form of \((a^2 &minus; b^2)\). There are no binomial factors that multiply together to get a sum of squares, so \(a^2 + b^2\) is prime. </li>
    <li> 6.6.3: Self Check </li>
    <li>6.6.3: Additional Resources</li>
  </ul>
  <li> 6.6.4: Sorting Polynomials by Factoring Methods </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you practiced recognizing which of these two methods you would use to factor based on the polynomial you were given. You learned that it is possible to have a polynomial that requires both of these methods to be factored completely. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
