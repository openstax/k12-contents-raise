<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Students will complete the following questions to practice the skills they have learned in this lesson.</em></p>
<p>For questions 1-3 choose an equivalent equation.</p> 
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>
    Which equation is equivalent to \(3x + 6 = 4x + 7\)?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>  
<p>\(3x-1=4x\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>
    Which equation is equivalent to \(3(x + 6) = 4x + 7\)?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>  
<p>\(3x+18=4x+7\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>
    Which equation is equivalent to \(4x + 3x = 7-6\)?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>  
<p>\(7x=1\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>
    <strong>Select three </strong>equations that have 0 as a solution.
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>  
<p>\(2x+10=4x+10\), \(4x=9x\),&nbsp;and&nbsp;\(2x-3+4x=4-7\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>
    Which equation is equivalent to 6(<em>x</em>-3)=24?
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>  
<p>\(x-3=4\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
  <li>
    Which of the following sets of equations are equivalent to each other?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>  
<p>10(<em>x</em>+9) = 50 and 2(<em>x</em>+9)=10. Each side of the equation was divided by 5. So the equations are equivalent.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="7">
  <li>
    Using the distributive property, choose which equation would be an equivalent equation to 3(<em>x</em>-2) =7.
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>  
<p>3<em>x</em> - 6 =7. It is one of the solutions that could be equivalent to 3(<em>x</em>-2) =7</p>
