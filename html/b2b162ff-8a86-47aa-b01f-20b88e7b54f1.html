<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4><br></h4>
<h4>Student Facing Statement</h4>
<p>Jesse&rsquo;s car gets 30 miles per gallon of gas.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>Write an equation using direct variation for distance, d, and number of gallons of gas, g for this problem.</li>
<li>If Jesse travels 150 miles he uses 5 gallons of gas. Find the constant of variation.</li>
<li>Now, write the equation if Jesse travels d miles with a car that uses 30 miles per gallon of gas.</li>
<li>If Las Vegas is 285 miles away, how many gallons of gas are needed to get there?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Student Response</h3>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>Use the equation for direct variation \( y=kx \). So, \( d=kg \).</li>
<li>Use the equation for direct variation \( y=kx \). So, 150=k(5). The constant of variation is \( k=30 \).</li>
<li>\( d=30g \)</li>
<li>Substitute 285 miles in for \( d \) in the equation. So, \( 285=30g \) and \( g=9.5 \).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Response to Student Thinking</h3>
<h4>More Chances</h4>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.<br>
