<h4>Creating a Sequence</h4>
<p>For a sequence: 1, 3, . . .</p>
<p>Write the next two terms that would make the sequence</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    geometric
  </li>
  <li>
    arithmetic
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Solution</h4>

<ol start="1">
  <li>
    To make the sequence geometric, there must be a common ratio.
  \(1\cdot3=3\), so use a common ratio of 3 to multiply each term by.
  The sequence becomes: 1, 3, 9, 27 . . .
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
  <li>
    To make the sequence arithmetic, there must be a common difference.
    \(3-1=2\), so use a common difference of 2 to add to each term.
    The sequence becomes: 1, 3, 5, 7 . . .</li>
</ol>

  <p>Here is how to create an arithmetic sequence given two terms:</p>
  <p>Find the common difference by subtracting the first term from the second term:</p>
  <p>\(6-2=4\)</p>
  <p>The common difference is 4.</p>
  <p>Add 4 to the previous term to find the next terms.</p>
  <p>The sequence becomes: 2, 6, 10, 14 . . .</p>
