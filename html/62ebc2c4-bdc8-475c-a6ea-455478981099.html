<h4>Transforming Graphs of Quadratics</h4>
<p>The graphs of \(y=x^2\), \(y=x^2+12\), and \(y=(x+3)^2\) all have the same shape but their locations are different. The graph that represents \(y=x^2\) has its vertex at \((0, 0)\).</p>

<p>Notice that adding 12 to \(x^2\) raises the graph by 12 units, so the vertex of that graph is at \((0, 12)\). Replacing \(x^2\) with \((x+3)^2\) shifts the graph 3 units to the left, so the vertex is now at \((-3, 0)\).</p>
<p>We can also shift a graph both horizontally and vertically.</p>
<p>The graph that represents \(y=(x+3)^2 +12\) will look like that for \(y=x^2\) but it will be shifted 12 units up and 3 units to the left. Its vertex is at \((-3, 12)\).</p>

<p>The graph representing the equation \(y=-(x+3)^2+12\) has the same vertex at \((-3, 12)\), but because the squared term \((x+3)^2\) is multiplied by a negative number, the graph is flipped over horizontally, so that it opens downward.</p>

  <p><span>Here is how to determine the transformations needed:</span><br></p>
  <p>Step 1<br>
    Identify the vertex of the new function.<br>
    \((2, 7)\)</p>
  <p>Step 2<br>
    Identify the shifts needed to go from the origin \((0,0)\) to the new vertex.<br>
    Right 2, up 7</p>
  <p>Step 3<br>
    Ask: Does the parabola open up or down? Does it reflect over the \(x\)-axis?<br>
    Opens down since the equation leads with a negative. Reflects over the \(x\)-axis. </p>
  <p>The transformations needed are right 2, up 7, and a reflection over the \(x\)-axis.</p>
