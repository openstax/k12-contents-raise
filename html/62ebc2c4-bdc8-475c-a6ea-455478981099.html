<h4>Transforming Graphs of Quadratics</h4>
<p>The graphs of \(y=x^2\), \(y=x^2+12\), and \(y=(x+3)^2\) all have the same shape but their locations are different. The graph that represents \(y=x^2\) has its vertex at \((0, 0)\).</p>

<p>Notice that adding 12 to \(x^2\) raises the graph by 12 units, so the vertex of that graph is at \((0, 12)\). Replacing \(x^2\) with \((x+3)^2\) shifts the graph 3 units to the left, so the vertex is now at \((-3, 0)\).</p>
<p>We can also shift a graph both horizontally and vertically.</p>
<p>The graph that represents \(y=(x+3)^2 +12\) will look like that for \(y=x^2\) but it will be shifted 12 units up and 3 units to the left. Its vertex is at \((-3, 12)\).</p>

<p>The graph representing the equation \(y=-(x+3)^2+12\) has the same vertex at \((-3, 12)\), but because the squared term \((x+3)^2\) is multiplied by a negative number, the graph is flipped over horizontally, so that it opens downward.</p>

<p>Quadratic equations can also be transformed through dilations that stretch or compress the parabola. The graphs for the parent quadratic function, \(y = x^2\), and \(y = 4x^2\), and \(y = \frac15x^2\) are all parabolas. The second and third equation, however, have been vertically dilated from the parent function.</p>

<p>The orange dashed parabola represents \(y = 4x^2\) and depicts the result of multiplying each output of the function by 4. This dilation represents a vertical stretch.</p>
<p>The green dotted parabola represents \(y = \frac 15x^2\) and depicts a graph where each of the output values from the function are multiplied by \(\frac15\). This dilation represents a vertical compression.</p>
<p>The scale factor of the coefficient we multiply by determines the impact on the graph. If the scale factor is greater than 1, then the dilation is a vertical stretch. If the scale factor is between 0 and 1, then the dilation is a vertical compression.</p>
<p>When quadratic equations are dilated horizontally, the result looks similar but the impact to the function is very different because horizontal dilations affect the input values before the function is applied. The graphs for the parent quadratic function, \(y =x^2\), and \(y = (4x)^2\) and \(y = (\frac13x)^2\) are displayed below.</p>

<p>The orange dashed parabola represents \(y = (4x)^2\) and depicts the result of multiplying each input of the function by 4 and then squaring. This dilation represents a horizontal compression.</p>
<p>The green dotted parabola represents \(y = (\frac 13x)^2\) and depicts a graph where each of the input values from the function are multiplied by \(\frac13\). This dilation represents a horizontal stretch.</p>
<p>Notice that the scale factor determines the impact on the graph here, too. If the scale factor is greater than 1, then the dilation is a horizontal compression. If the scale factor is between 0 and 1, then the dilation is a horizontal stretch.</p>

  </p>
  <p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Identify the vertex of the new function.<br>
    \((2, 7)\)</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Identify the shifts needed to go from the origin \((0,0)\) to the new vertex.<br>
    Right 2, up 7</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Ask: Does the parabola open up or down? Does it reflect over the \(x\)-axis?<br>
    Opens down since the equation leads with a negative. Reflects over the \(x\)-axis. </p>
  <p>The transformations needed are right 2, up 7, and a reflection over the \(x\)-axis.</p>
