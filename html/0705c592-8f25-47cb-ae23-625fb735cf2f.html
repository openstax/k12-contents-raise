<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm-up prompts students to recall what they know about the solution to an equation in one variable. Students
  interpret a given equation in the context of a situation, explain why certain values are not solutions to the
  equation, and then find the value that is the solution.<br></p>

<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Assign students a partner and allow them to &ldquo;turn and talk&rdquo; to their partner about their answers.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>A granola bite contains 27 calories. Most of the calories come from \( c \) grams of carbohydrates. The rest come
  from other ingredients. One gram of carbohydrate contains 4 calories.</p>
<p>The equation \( 4c + 5= 27 \) represents the relationship between these quantities.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>What could the 5 represent in this situation?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> For example: It could represent the calories from other ingredients in the granola bite.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Priya said that neither 8 nor 3 could be the solution to the equation. Is she correct?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, she is correct that 8 and 3 could not be solutions. Sample explanation: \( 4(8) + 5 \) is 37, not 27,
  and \( 4(3) + 5 \) is 17, not 27.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Marcus said the solution is 5.5. Is he correct? Explain.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, he is correct that 5.5 is a solution. \( 4(5.5) + 5 \) is 27.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Focus the discussion on how students knew that 8 and 3 are not solutions to the equation and how they found the
  solution. Highlight strategies that are based on reasoning about what values make the equation true.</p>
<p>Ask students: &ldquo;In general, what does a solution to an equation mean?&rdquo; Make sure students recall that the
  solution to an equation in one variable is a value for the variable that makes the equation a true statement.</p>
