        <h2>Warm-Up (5 minutes)</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="body">
        <p><span>This warm-up prompts students to recall what they know about the solution to an equation in one variable. Students interpret a given equation in the context of a situation, explain why certain values are not solutions to the equation, and then find the value that is the solution.</span><br></p>
      </div>
      <h3>Launch</h3>
      <p>Assign students a partner and allow them to &ldquo;turn and talk&rdquo; to their partner about their answers.</p>
      <h3>Student Facing Statement</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>A granola bite contains 27 calories. Most of the calories come from <span class="math math-repaired">\( c \)</span> grams of carbohydrates. The rest come from other ingredients. One gram of carbohydrate contains 4 calories.</p>
        <p>The equation <span class="math math-repaired">\( 4c + 5= 27 \)</span> represents the relationship between these quantities.</p>
        <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
          <li>What could the 5 represent in this situation?
          </li>
          <li>Priya said that neither 8 nor 3 could be the solution to the equation. Is she is correct?</li>
          <li>Marcus said the solution is 5.5. Is he correct? Explain.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <h3>Student Response</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
          <li>For example: It could represent the calories from other ingredients in the granola bite.</li>
          <li>Yes, she is correct that 8 and 3 could not be solutions. Sample explanation: <span class="math math-repaired">\( 4(8) + 5 \)</span> is 37, not 27, and <span class="math math-repaired">\( 4(3) + 5 \)</span> is 17, not 27.</li>
          <li><span class="math math-repaired">Yes, he is correct that 5.5 is a solution.&nbsp;\( 4(5.5) + 5 \) is 27.</span></li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>Focus the discussion on how students knew that 8 and 3 are not solutions to the equation and how they found the solution. Highlight strategies that are based on reasoning about what values make the equation true.</p>
        <p>Ask students: &ldquo;In general, what does a solution to an equation mean?&rdquo; Make sure students recall that the solution to an equation in one variable is a value for the variable that makes the equation a true statement.</p>
