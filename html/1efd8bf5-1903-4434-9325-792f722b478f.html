<p>Reinforce the key points of this lesson by displaying some quadratic expressions such as:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> \(x^2+4x+8\) </li>
  <li> \(x^2+24x+144\) </li>
  <li> \(x^2+6x+16\) </li>
  <li> \(x^2&minus;40x+400\) </li>
</ul>
<p>Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> "Which of these quadratic expressions are perfect squares? Which are not?" (The second and fourth expressions are perfect squares. The other two are not.) </li>
  <li> "How can you tell?" (When in standard form, an expression with perfect squares has a constant term that is a number squared and a linear term that is twice that number. In \(x^2+24x+144\), we can see 144 is 12 squared, and 24 is twice 12. In \(x^2&minus;40x+400\), the term 400 is -20 squared and -40 is twice -20.) </li>
  <li> "Why isn't the third expression a perfect square? Isn't 16 a perfect square?" (16 is 4 squared or -4 squared, but for the expression to be a perfect square, the coefficient of the linear term should be 8 (twice 4) or -8 (twice 4).) </li>
  <li> "Suppose we have two equations: \(x^2&minus;10x+16=9\) and \(x^2&minus;40x+400=9\). Which is easier to solve? Why?" (The second one, because the equation has a perfect square on each side. It can be rewritten as \((x&minus;20)^2=9\). There are two numbers that can be squared to make 9, which are 3 and -3, so \(x&minus;20=3\) or \(x&minus;20=-3\).) </li>
  <li> "Can't we simply rewrite the left side of \(x^2&minus;10x+16=9\) in factored form and solve?" (Rewriting the left side gives \((x&minus;8)(x&minus;2)=9\), but now we are stuck. We can't use the zero product property because the expression does not equal 0.) </li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
