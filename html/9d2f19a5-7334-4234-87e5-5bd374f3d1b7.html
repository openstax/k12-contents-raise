<p>To help students consolidate the ideas in this lesson, ask questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> &ldquo;What does it mean to expand a factored expression?&rdquo; (To multiply out all the terms in each factor.) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;Show how a diagram can help us expand \((x+4)(x-10)\) and write an equivalent expression.&rdquo; </li>
  <li> &ldquo;How can we expand \((x+4)(x-10)\) using the Distributive Property and without drawing a diagram?&rdquo; </li>
  <li> &ldquo;How would you explain to a friend who is absent today how to write an equivalent expression for&nbsp; \((x-10)(x-15)\)? What strategy (or strategies) would you suggest?&rdquo; </li>
  <li> &ldquo;Give a few different examples of quadratic expressions in standard form and a few in factored form. Ask a partner if they agree that your examples are, indeed, in those forms.&rdquo; </li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
