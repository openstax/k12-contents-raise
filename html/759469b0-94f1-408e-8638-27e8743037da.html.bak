<h4> Comparing Real-Life Functions</h4>
<p>Two people, Adam and Bianca, are competing to see who can save more money in one month. Use the table and the graph below to determine who will save more money at the end of the month. State how much money each person had at the start of the competition. (Assume each is following a linear function in his or her saving habit.) Let Adam’s function be represented by \(A(t)\), where \(t\) is days, and Bianca’s function be represented by \(B(t)\).</p>
<p><img alt="A line graph titled Adam's Savings shows total savings in dollars on the y-axis and number of days on the x-axis. The line starts with $3 and rises steadily to $11 by day 3." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/ec6bded82a5fbe84db96a30e86dcf0a4db52d969" width="300"/></p>

<p><img alt="A line graph titled Bianca’s Savings shows a straight, upward-sloping orange line indicating total savings in dollars increasing steadily over several days. The x-axis is labeled Number of Days and the y-axis Total Amount of Money in Dollars." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b71398255c12020ba0f3a92da1b17a020a5fd2fe" width="300"/></p>
<p>Which is greater, \(A(2)\) or \(B(2)\)? Explain what this answer means.</p>
<p>\(A(2)=9\) and \(B(2)=8\), so after 2 days, Adam has saved more money.</p>

<p>Here is how to determine who went a greater distance:</p>
<p>Aleph traveled farther in 40 minutes. Comparing the graphs, \(A(40)\) is 5.5 miles, and \(S(40)\) is approximately 2.5 miles.</p>
