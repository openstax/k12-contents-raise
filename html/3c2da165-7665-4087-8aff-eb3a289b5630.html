<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<div>
  <p>In this
    activity, students write equations in one variable to represent the
    constraints in a situation. They then reason about the solutions and
    interpret the solutions in context. </p>
  <p>To solve the equation, some students may try different values of \( h \)</span> until they find one that
    gives a true equation. Others may perform the same operations to each side of the equation to isolate \( h
    \). Identify students who use different strategies and ask them to share later.</p>
  <h4>Launch</h4>
    <p>Arrange students
      in groups of 2 and encourage students to use Desmos to model the
      scenario in question 1 as an equation. Let students in different groups
      compare their equations, or discuss as a whole class before moving on. </p>
    <p>For
      questions 2&ndash;4, give students a few minutes of quiet work time and then
      time to discuss their responses. Ask them to share with their partner
      their explanations for why 4 and 7 are or are not solutions.</p>
    <p>If
      students are unsure how to interpret &ldquo;take-home earnings,&rdquo; clarify that
      it means the amount Jada takes home after paying job-related expenses
      (in this case, the bus fare).</p>

    <h4>Student Activity</h4>
    <p>Jada has time on the weekends to earn some money. A local bookstore is looking for someone to help sort books and
      will pay $12.20 an hour. To get to and from the bookstore on a work day, however, Jada would have to
      spend $7.15 on bus fare. </p>
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
      <li>Write an equation that represents Jada&rsquo;s take-home earnings in dollars, \( E \), if she
        works at the bookstore for \( h \) hours in one day.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( E= 12.20h - 7.15 \)</p>
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
      <li>One day, Jada takes home $90.45 after working \( h \) hours and after paying the bus
        fare. Write an equation to represent this situation.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( 90.45 = 12.20h - 7.15 \) (or equivalent)</p>
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
      <li>Is 4 a solution to the last equation you wrote?
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>If so, be prepared to explain how you know it is a solution.
      </li>
      <li>If not, be prepared to explain why it is not a solution. Then, find the solution.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. </p>
    <p>Substituting 4 into the equation gives \(90.45=12.20(4)-7.15\) or \(90.45=41.65\), which is not a true statement.
      The solution is 8. Substituting 8 into the equation gives \(90.45=90.45\), which is true.</p>
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
      <li>Is 7 a solution to the last equation you wrote?
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>If so, be prepared to explain how you know it is a solution.
      </li>
      <li>If not, be prepared to explain why it is not a solution. Then, find the solution.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. </p>
    <p>Substituting 7 into the equation gives \(90.45=78.25\), which is also false. The solution is 8. Substituting 8
      into the equation gives \(90.45=90.45\), which is true.
    </p>
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
      <li>In this situation, what does the solution to the equation tell us?
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> It tells us the number of hours that Jada worked that allowed her to take home $90.45
      after paying for her bus fare.</p>
    <h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
    <h4>Are you ready for more?</h4>
    <p>Jada has a second option to earn money: she could help some neighbors with errands and computer work for
      $11 an hour. After reconsidering her schedule, Jada realizes that she has about 9 hours available to
      work one day of the weekend.</p>
    <p>Which option should she choose&mdash;sorting books at the bookstore or helping her neighbors? Be prepared to show
      your reasoning.</p>
    <h4>Extension Student Response</h4>
    <p>Students could argue either way, depending on their assumptions. </p>
    Compare your answer:
    <ul>
      <li>Jada should work at the bookstore because she would earn more there. Her pay would be $109.80,
        and after subtracting $7.15 for the bus fare, she would still earn $102.65. She would
        earn $99 from the other option.</li>
      <li>Jada should
        help her neighbors. Working 9 hours at the bookstore would mean a few
        more dollars than working 9 hours helping her neighbors, but it would
        also mean losing some personal time because of the travel involved.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
    <p>If students struggle to write equations in the first question, ask them how they might find out Jada&rsquo;s
      earnings if she works 1 hour, 2 hours, 5 hours,
      and so on. Then, ask them to generalize the computation process for \( h \) hours.</p>
    <h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
    <p>Ask a student to share the equation that represents Jada earning $90.45. Make sure students
      understand why \( 90.45 = 12.20h - 7.15 \) describes that constraint. </p>
    <p>Next, invite
      students to share how they knew if 4 and 7 are or are not solutions to
      the equation. Highlight that substituting those values into the equation
      and evaluating them lead to false equations. </p>
    <p>Then, select
      students using different strategies to share how they found the
      solution. Some students might notice that the solution must be greater
      than 7 (because when \( h=7 \), the expression \( 12.20h-7.15 \) has a value less than
      90.45) and start by checking if \( h=8 \) is a solution. If no students mention this, ask them about
      it. </p>
    <p>Make sure
      students understand what the solution means in context. Emphasize that 8
      is the number of hours that meets all the constraints in the situation.
      Jada gets paid $12.20 an hour, pays $7.15 in bus fare, and takes home
      $90.45. For all of these to be true, she must have worked 8 hours.</p>

    <h4>Verify a Solution of an Equation</h4>
    <p>Solving an <span data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">equation</span> is like discovering the
      answer to a puzzle. The purpose in solving an equation is to find the value or values of the <span
        data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">variable</span>
      that make each side of the equation the same so that we end up with a
      true statement. Any value of the variable that makes the equation true
      is called a <span data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">solution of an equation</span>. It is
      the answer to the puzzle!</p>
    <p>How to determine whether a number is a solution to an equation:</p>
    <p><strong>STEP 1:</strong> Substitute the number in for the variable in the equation.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2 </strong> -Simplify the expressions on both sides of the equation</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3 </strong> -Determine whether the resulting equation is true (the left side is equal to the right
      side).<br>
      If it is true, the number is a solution.<br>
      If it is not true, the number is not a solution.</p>
    <p>For example, the equation \( 2l+2w=72 \) represents the relationship between the length, \( l \), and the width,
      \( w \), of a rectangle that has a perimeter of 72 units. If we know that the length is 15 units, what is the
      value of the width?
    </p>
    <p><strong>STEP 1:</strong> Substitute the number in for the variable in the equation.</p>
    <p>\( 2(15)+2w=72 \)</p>
    <p>This is an equation in one variable because \(w\) is the only quantity that we don't know. To solve this equation
      means to find a value of \(w\) that makes the equation true.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2 </strong> -Simplify the expressions on both sides of the equation<br>
      In this case, 21 is the solution because substituting 21 for \( w \) in the equation results in a true statement.
    </p>
    <p>\( 2(15)+2w=72 \)</p>
    <p>\( 2(15)+2(21)=72 \)</p>
    <p>\( 30+42=72 \)</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3 </strong> -Determine whether the resulting equation is true (the left side is equal to the right
      side).<br>
      If it is true, the number is a solution.<br>
      If it is not true, the number is not a solution.</p>
    <p>\( 72=72 \)</p>
    <h4>Try It: Verify a Solution of an Equation</h4>
    <p>The equation \(2l + 2w = 48\) represents the perimeter of a rectangle.
    </p>
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
      <li>If the width of the rectangle is 10, what is the new equation?
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(2l + 2(10) = 48\) or \(2l + 20 = 48\)</p>
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
      <li>What is the length of the rectangle that has a width of 10?
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> 14 is the length of the rectangle that makes the statement \(2l + 20 = 48\) true.</p>
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
      <li>Verify the solution.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> To verify the solution, substitute \(w = 10\) and \(l = 14\) into \(2l + 2w = 48\).<br>
      \(2(14) + 2(10) = 48\)<br>
      \(28 + 20 = 48\)<br>
      \(48 = 48\) is a true statement, so the solution works!
