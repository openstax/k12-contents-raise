<h2>Activity (15 minutes)</h2>
<div>
  <p>In this
    activity, students write equations in one variable to represent the
    constraints in a situation. They then reason about the solutions and
    interpret the solutions in context. </p>
  <p>To solve the equation, some students may try different values of <span>\( h \)</span> until they find one that gives a true equation. Others may perform the same operations to each side of the equation to isolate <span>\( h \)</span>. Identify students who use different strategies and ask them to share later.</p>
</div>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<div>
  <p>Arrange students
    in groups of 2 and encourage students to use Desmos to model the
    scenario in question 1 as an equation. Let students in different groups
    compare their equations, or discuss as a whole class before moving on.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For
    questions 2&ndash;4, give students a few minutes of quiet work time and then
    time to discuss their responses. Ask them to share with their partner
    their explanations for why 4 and 7 are or are not solutions.</p>
  <p>If
    students are unsure how to interpret &ldquo;take-home earnings,&rdquo; clarify that
    it means the amount Jada takes home after paying job-related expenses
    (in this case, the bus fare).</p>

  <h4>Student Activity</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Jada has time on the weekends to earn some money. A local bookstore is looking for someone to help sort books and will pay <span>$</span>12.20 an hour. To get to and from the bookstore on a work day, however, Jada would have to spend <span>$</span>7.15 on bus fare. </p>
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
      <li>Write an equation that represents Jada&rsquo;s take-home earnings in dollars, <span>\( E \)</span>, if she works at the bookstore for <span>\( h \)</span> hours in one day.
      </li>
      <li>One day, Jada takes home <span>$</span>90.45 after working <span>\( h \)</span> hours and after paying the bus fare. Write an equation to represent this situation.
      </li>
      <li>Is 4 a solution to the last equation you wrote? What about 7?
        <ul>
          <li>If so, be prepared to explain how you know one or both of them are solutions.</li>
          <li>If not, be prepared to explain why they are not solutions. Then, find the solution.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>In this situation, what does the solution to the equation tell us?
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <h3>Student Response</h3>
  <div>
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
      <li><span>\( E= 12.20h - 7.15 \)</span></li>
      <li>
        <span>\( 90.45 = 12.20h - 7.15 \)</span> (or equivalent)
      </li>
      <li>Neither 4 nor 7 is a solution. For example:
        <ul>
          <li>Substituting 4 into the equation gives <span>\( 90.45 = 12.20(4) - 7.15 \)</span> or <span>\( 90.45 = 41.65 \)</span>, which is not a true statement.</li>
          <li>Substituting 7 into the equation gives <span>\( 90.45 = 78.25 \)</span>, which is also false.</li>
          <li>The solution is 8. Substituting 8 into the equation gives <span>\( 90.45=90.45 \)</span>, which is true.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>It tells us the number of hours that Jada worked that allowed her to take home <span>$</span>90.45 after paying for her bus fare.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <h3>Student Facing Extension</h3>
  <h4>Are you ready for more?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Jada has a second option to earn money: she could help some neighbors with errands and computer work for <span>$</span>11 an hour. After reconsidering her schedule, Jada realizes that she has about 9 hours available to work one day of the weekend.</p>
    <p>Which option should she choose&mdash;sorting books at the bookstore or helping her neighbors? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>Extension Student Response</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Students could argue either way, depending on their assumptions.&nbsp;</p>
    Compare your answer:
    <ul>
      <li>Jada should work at the bookstore because she would earn more there. Her pay would be <span>$</span>109.80, and after subtracting <span>$</span>7.15 for the bus fare, she would still earn <span>$</span>102.65. She would earn <span>$</span>99 from the other option.</li>
      <li>Jada should
        help her neighbors. Working 9 hours at the bookstore would mean a few
        more dollars than working 9 hours helping her neighbors, but it would
        also mean losing some personal time because of the travel involved.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>
  <div>
    <p>If students
      struggle to write equations in the first question, ask them how they
      might find out Jada&rsquo;s earnings if she works 1 hour, 2 hours, 5 hours,
      and so on. Then, ask them to generalize the computation process for <span>\( h \)</span> hours.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Ask a student to share the equation that represents Jada earning <span>$</span>90.45. Make sure students understand why <span>\( 90.45 = 12.20h - 7.15 \)</span> describes that constraint. </p>
    <p>Next, invite
      students to share how they knew if 4 and 7 are or are not solutions to
      the equation. Highlight that substituting those values into the equation
      and evaluating them lead to false equations. </p>
    <p>Then, select
      students using different strategies to share how they found the
      solution. Some students might notice that the solution must be greater
      than 7 (because when <span>\( h=7 \)</span>, the expression <span>\( 12.20h-7.15 \)</span> has a value less than 90.45) and start by checking if <span>\( h=8 \)</span> is a solution. If no students mention this, ask them about it. </p>
    <p>Make sure
      students understand what the solution means in context. Emphasize that 8
      is the number of hours that meets all the constraints in the situation.
      Jada gets paid <span>$</span>12.20 an hour, pays <span>$</span>7.15 in bus fare, and takes home <span>$</span>90.45. For all of these to be true, she must have worked 8 hours.</p>

      <p>For example, the equation&nbsp;\( 2l+2w=72 \)&nbsp;represents the
        relationship between the length, \(&nbsp;l&nbsp;\), and the width, \(&nbsp;w&nbsp;\), of a
        rectangle that has a perimeter of 72 units. If we know that the length
        is 15 units, we can rewrite the equation as:</p>
      <p>\(&nbsp;2(15)+2w=72&nbsp;\)</p>
      <p>This is an equation in one variable because \( w \) is the only
        quantity that we don&rsquo;t know. To solve this equation means to find a
        value of \( w \) that makes the equation true.</p>
      <p>In this case, 21 is the solution because substituting 21 for \( w \) in the equation results in a true statement.</p>
