<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>The mathematical purpose of this lesson is to understand how a linear model is used to describe the relationship
  between two numerical variables and to use a line of best fit to make predictions. The work of this lesson connects to
  previous work because students investigated patterns of association in bivariate data in eighth grade and in a
  previous lesson. The work of this lesson connects to upcoming work because students will use technology to fit a line
  of best fit to data and will formally assess the strength of a linear relationship.</p>
<p>When students articulate things they notice and things they wonder about a scatter plot and the accompanying linear
  model, students have an opportunity to attend to precision in the language they use to describe what they see.
  Students reason abstractly by making sense of slope and intercept in context.</p>
<p>One of the activities in this lesson works best when each student has access to devices that can run Desmos because
  students benefit from estimating the line of best fit in a dynamic way.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Fit a linear model to a scatter plot of data and informally judge its goodness of fit.</li>
  <li>Interpret (orally and in writing) the rate of change and vertical intercept for a linear model in everyday
    language.</li>
  <li>Predict (extrapolate) and estimate (interpolate) values not given in the data set by using an equation
    representing the linear model.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Describe the rate of change and \(y\)-intercept for a linear model in everyday language.</li>
  <li>Draw a linear model that fits the data well and use the linear model to estimate values.</li>
</ul>

  <h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
  <p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are
    only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.
    Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.
  </p>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>ELPS 1(E) internalize new basic and academic language by using and reusing it in meaningful ways in speaking and
    writing activities that build concept and language attainment
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 1(F) use accessible language and learn new and essential language in the process
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build
    and reinforce concept and language attainment
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(B) expand and internalize initial English vocabulary by learning and using high-frequency English words
    necessary for identifying and describing people, places, and objects, by retelling simple stories and basic
    information represented or supported by pictures, and by learning and using routine language needed for classroom
    communication
  </li>
</ul>
