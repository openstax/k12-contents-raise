<p><strong><em>Students will complete the following questions to practice the skills they have learned in this lesson.</em></strong></p>
<p>For questions 1&ndash;4, use the following:</p>
<blockquote>
     <p>Function \(h\)&nbsp;describes the height of a ball, in inches, after \(n\)<em> </em>bounces and is defined by the equation \(h(n)=120 \cdot (\frac{4}{5})^n\).</p>
</blockquote>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>
    What is \(h(3)\)? Round to the nearest integer. Think about what it represents in this situation.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> 61
</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>
    Could \(h(n)\) be 150?&nbsp;
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  <strong>Answer: </strong>No
</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>
    Which ball loses its height more quickly: This ball, modeled by \(h(n)=120 \cdot (\frac{4}{5})^n\), or a tennis ball whose height in inches after \(n\) bounces is modeled by the function \(f\) where \(f(n)=50 \cdot (\frac{5}{9})^n\)?</li>
</ol>
<p>
  <strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The ball modeled by \(f(n)\)

  <li>
    How many bounces would it take before the ball bounces less than 12 inches from the surface? </li>
</ol>
<p>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> 11

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>
    After a second bounce, a ball reached a height of 70 cm. The rebound factor for the ball was 0.8. From approximately what height, in cm, was the ball dropped?  </li>
