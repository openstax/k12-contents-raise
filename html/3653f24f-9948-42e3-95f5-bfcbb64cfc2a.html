<p>In this lesson, you will gain understanding of the structure of perfect-square expressions. This lesson will also help you see that perfect squares can be handy for solving equations because we can find their square roots.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> Recognize perfect-square expressions written in different forms. </li>
<li> Recognize quadratic equations that have a perfect-square expression and solve the equations. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
