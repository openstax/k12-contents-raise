<p>Establishing a community of learners is an important part of providing students with a safe place to learn and getting the most out of this curricular resource. In practice, this means:</p>
<ul>
  <li>setting the tone that each and every student brings something valuable to the community;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>honoring the diverse experiences students bring to the classroom;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>communicating, both explicitly and implicitly, that students&rsquo; ideas are important enough to be heard and, when appropriate, to drive instruction;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>supporting student engagement with a variety of strategies; and&nbsp;</li>
  <li>approaching each and every student in a way that shows their thinking can grow over time.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In short, it&rsquo;s crucial to demonstrate a true belief that each and every student can and will be successful.</p>
<p>Many of the activities in this program utilize small groups of 2-4. When students are discussing mathematics, encouraging them to use sentence frames promotes the idea that each and every student can make positive contributions. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;I agree, because&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;I respectfully disagree, because&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;I have a question: Why is&hellip;?&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How did you know you needed to&hellip;?&rdquo;
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Supporting small groups helps students get along, encourages equitable participation, and provides opportunities for students to rehearse their ideas in preparation for sharing with the whole class.</p>
<p>In addition, many teachers use group roles to provide a structure in which students understand how to start participating. Here are a few examples from the <a href="https://www.sfusdmath.org/group-roles.html" target="_blank">San Francisco Unified School District</a>.</p>
