<p>Meaningful learning that can transfer to new contexts is more likely to occur in classrooms with rich classroom discourse. Classroom discussion is a form of generative learning. It is facilitated by teachers who give thoughtful cues and purposeful questions to get conversations flowing and keep them on track. 
</p>

<p><strong>Rich classroom discourse is characterized by a handful of features</strong>(Hattie, Fisher, & Frey, 2017):</p>

<ol>
    <li>Students making connections to prior knowledge
    </li>
    <li>Framing mistakes as valuable learning opportunities
    </li>
    <li>Comparing and contrasting different approaches
    </li>
    <li>Productive failure/ productive struggle and perseverance through difficulties, with a focus on “sensemaking”
    </li>
    <li>Students using a variety of representations to build understanding and justify their thinking, accompanied by the messaging that there is no one right way to get there
    </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>How to Promote Effective Classroom Discussion
</strong></p>

<p>There are a number of strategies a teacher can use to encourage fruitful discussion opportunities (Hattie, Fisher, & Frey, 2017). These include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Posing <strong>purposeful questions</strong> that check, build, and deepen student understanding
    </li>
    <li><strong>Funneling questions</strong> that guide students down the teacher’s path to the answer
    </li>
    <li><strong>Focusing questions</strong> that allow students to do the cognitive work to push their understanding forward
    </li>
    <li><strong>Prompts</strong> for students to use what they already know
    </li>
    <li><strong>Cues</strong> or overt attempts to draw attention to information the student needs to more forward
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for the student to be doing the bulk of the cognitive work to build and extend their understanding, with the teacher acting as a scaffold to keep them on track and push them into their “Zone of Proximal Development.”
</p>

<p><strong>A well-facilitated classroom discussion can take patience and skill, but pays dividends in terms of student understanding and self-efficacy.
