<p>When Nafy is creating recipes for her healthy snack mixes, she can consider constraints to make sure the combination of ingredients meets her goals. She can use inequalities in two variables to find combinations of two ingredients that meet constraints on cost, nutritional value, or weight.</p><p>In this section, you will transition from writing and solving inequalities in one variable to writing and solving inequalities in two variables. You will learn that the solutions to inequalities involve pairs of values. When graphed, the solutions comprise a region bounded by a line. You will write inequalities in two variables to represent constraints, and you will interpret the points on a boundary line and on either side of it in terms of the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This section includes 3 lessons:</p>
