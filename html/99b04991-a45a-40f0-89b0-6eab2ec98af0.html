<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Divide students in pairs to work.
  This activity will give students an opportunity to work on manipulating the different forms of linear equations to create equivalent equations </p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p> Earlier in the lesson, students wrote equations in slope-intercept form and point-slope form. 
  This activity will give students an opportunity to work on manipulating the different forms of linear equations to create equivalent equations. They will manipulate equations to write them in slope-intercept, point-slope, and standard forms.
  </p>
<p><strong>Three Different Forms of Linear Equations</strong></p>
<p>Work with a partner to answer questions 1-3.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" >
  <li> What is the slope-intercept form of a linear equation? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>\(y = mx + b\)</p>
<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li> What is the point-slope form of a linear equation? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;\(y -y_1= m (x -x_1 )\)</p>
<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li> What is the standard form of a linear equation? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(Ax + By = C\)</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Using the Different Forms to Write Equivalent Equations</strong></p>
<p>Linear equations can be written in the different forms to create linear equations. Use the linear equation forms from questions 1-3 to help you complete the rest of the activity. Remember to show all of your work on your paper and to use inverse operations to move terms to different sides of the equation.</p>
<p>For questions 4-5, use the equation \(y-4=3(x+1)\).</p>
<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li> Write the equation in slope-intercept form. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(y=3x+7\)</p>
<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li> Write the equation in standard form. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>\(3x-y = -7\)</p>
<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
  <li> Write \(4x -6y =12\) in slope-intercept form. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;\(y=\frac{4}{6}x-2\) or&nbsp; \(y=\frac{2}{3}x-2\)</p>
<br>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>After students have time to discuss questions 1-3 with a partner, bring the class together to share the three forms and write them on the board. Ask for volunteers to explain what each variable stands for in the forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allow students to work independently on questions 4-6, then come together as partners to check each other&rsquo;s work and discuss how they wrote the equations in the different forms. Encourage students to discuss any mistakes they made. Ask for volunteers to share to the class what they will watch out for next time (such as changing signs, properly using inverse operations, balancing equations, and making sure standard form does not lead with a negative).</p>
<p>If time allows, encourage students to each make up an equation in one form and ask their partners to write their equation in a different form. Students can then switch partners and exchange another equation with another partner and repeat. This can continue as time allows. </p>

<h4>Writing Equivalent Linear Forms</h4>
<p>Write an equation of a line in all three forms that has a slope of 2 and a \(y\)-intercept of 7.</p>
<p><strong>Slope-Intercept Form</strong><br>
Slope-intercept form is \(y=mx + b\) where m is the slope and \(b\) is the \(y\)-intercept.<br>
Substitute \(m=2\) and \(b=7\) to have the equation \(y = 2x + 7\).</p>
<p><strong>Standard Form</strong><br>
Write the same equation in standard form.<br>
Standard form is \(Ax + By =C\).</p>
<p>Remember that A can not be negative and there should not be any fractions or decimals.</p>
<p>For this form, rearrange slope-intercept form to lead with the x term:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Bring the \(x\) and \(y\) terms on the left side.<br>
\(y-2x = 2x-2x + 7\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Simplify.<br>
\(-2x + y = 7\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Divide all terms by -1 so that \(A\) is not negative.<br>
\(\frac{-2x}{ -1}+ \frac{y}{-1} = {7}{-1}\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Simplify.<br>
\(2x - y = -7\)</p>
<p><strong>Point-Slope Form</strong><br>
Point-Slope form is \(y-y_1=m(x-x_1)\).<br>
Substitute the slope in for \(m \)and the point in for \((x_1, y_1)\).<br>
\(m= 2\), \(x_1=0\), \(y_1=7\)<br>
\(y-7=2(x-0)\)</p>
<p>Notice this can easily be written in slope-intercept form by solving for \(y\):</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}y-7&amp;=&amp;2(x-0)\\y-7&amp;=&amp;2x-0\\y-7+7&amp;=&amp;2x-0+7\\y&amp;=&amp;2x+7\end{array}\)</p>
<p><strong>Standard Form to Slope-Intercept Form</strong><br>
Standard form can also be rearranged into slope-intercept form.</p>
<p>Write \(3x - 5y = 14\) in slope-intercept form.<br>
Work to solve for \(y\).</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Bring the \(x\) term to the right side with the constant.<br>
\(3x -3x - 5y = 14 -3x\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Simplify.<br>
\(- 5y = 14 -3x\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Divide by the coefficient of \(y\).&nbsp;<br>
\(\frac{-5y}{-5}=\frac{14}{5}-\frac{3}{5}x\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Simplify and write in the correct order.<br>
  \(
y=-\frac{3}{5}x+\frac{14}{5}\)</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Try It: Writing Equivalent Linear Forms</h4>
<p>Write the equation \(3x +8y =24\) in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Compare your answer: \(y=-\frac{3x}{8}+3\)</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}3x-3x +8y &amp;=&amp;24-3x \\8y &amp;=&amp;24-3x\\\frac{8y}{8} &amp;=&amp;\frac{24}{8}-\frac{3x}{8}\\y&amp;=&amp;-\frac{3x}{8}+3\end{array}\)</p>
