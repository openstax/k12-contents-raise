<h3>Warm Up (10 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students find at least one solution of \(x^2 &minus; 2x &minus; 35 = 0\) by substituting different values of \(x\), evaluating the expression, and checking if it has a value of 0. Experiencing this inefficient method puts students in a better position to appreciate why it may be desirable to write \(x^2&minus; 2x &minus; 35\) in factored form and use the zero product property.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Once students have had a chance to evaluate the expression \(x^2&minus; 2x &minus; 35\) using their chosen number for \(x\), ask if anyone found a value that made the expression equal 0. (It&rsquo;s 7.) Give students a couple of minutes to look for the other value outside of 0 to 10 that makes the expression equal 0.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Let's try to find at least one solution to \(x^2&minus; 2x &minus; 35 = 0\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>Create a table of values. In column 1, enter the whole numbers between 0 and 10 to represent values of x. In column 2, evaluate the expression \(x^2-2x-35\) using the values for \(x\).
  </li>
</ol>

<br>
<p>We can see from the table that a solution to the equation is \(x = 7\) since \(x^2- 2x - 35 = 0\) at that value.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li>There is another number outside of 0 to 10 that would make the expression \(x^2&minus; 2x &minus; 35\) equal 0. Can you find it?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The other zero for the equation is located at \(x=-5\), but it is possible that you did not consider negative numbers.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>If a student found that \(x=-5\) makes the expression equal 0, ask them to demonstrate that \((-5)2 &minus; 2(-5) &minus; 35\) equals 0.</p>
<p>Discuss with students:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>"Can \(x^2&minus; 2x &minus; 35\) be written in factored form? What are the factors?" (Yes. \((x &minus; 7)\) and \((x + 5)\).) </li>
<li>"If \(x^2&minus; 2x &minus; 35\) can be written as \((x &minus; 7)(x + 5)\), can we solve \((x &minus; 7)(x + 5) = 0\) instead?" (Yes.) "Will the solutions change if we use this equation?" (No. The equations are equivalent, so they have the same solutions.) </li>
<li>"Why might someone choose to rewrite \(x^2&minus; 2x &minus; 35 = 0\) and solve \((x &minus; 7)(x + 5) = 0\) instead?" (Because the expression is equal to 0, rewriting it in factored form allows us to use the zero product property to find both solutions. It may be more efficient than substituting and evaluating many values for \(x\). It also makes it possible to see how many solutions there are, which is not always easy to tell when the quadratic expression is in standard form.) </li>
