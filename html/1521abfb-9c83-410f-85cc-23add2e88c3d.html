<h4>Adding Two
  Equations in a Real-World Situation</h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the situation described and write a system of equations.</p>
<p>Paulina went to the pool 8 times and the skating rink 4 times this month. She spent a total of $128 on admission to both places. Last month, she went to the pool 3 times and the skating rink 4 times. Last month she spent $83 on admission to both places.</p>
<p>Let \(p\) represent the cost of the pool and \(s\) represent the cost of the skating rink.</p>
<table class="os-raise-midsizetable">
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col">This Month</th>
<th scope="col">Last Month</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>\( 8p + 4s = 128 \)</td>
<td>\( 3p + 4s = 83 \)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br>
<p>So, this system represents the constraints in this situation:</p>
<p>\( \left\{ \begin{array}{c l} 8p+4s=128\\ 3p+4s=83 \end{array}\right. \)</p>
<p>Over both months, she went to the pool 11 times and the skating rink 8 times. She spent a total of $128 + $83, or $211, over both months.</p>
<p>The equation that represents this total is \( 11p + 8s = 211 \). Notice this is the equivalent of adding the like terms of the two equations in the system of equations.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s solve the original system and determine if the solution also applies to this new equation.</p>
<p>Using substitution, we find that the solution is \((9, 14)\), or the pool costs $9 and the skating rink costs $14.</p>
<p>Substitute these values into the new equation:</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}11p+8s&amp;=&amp;211\\11(9)+8(14)&amp;=&amp;211\\99+112&amp;=&amp;211\\211&amp;=&amp;211\checkmark\end{array}\)</p>
<p>Adding the equations together produces a new equation that has the same solution.</p>

<p>Alicia is a chef for a restaurant. This week, she ordered 32 steaks and 45 chickens. The total cost this week was $840.</p>
<p> Last week, she ordered 32 steaks and 24 chickens. The total cost was $672.</p>
<p>Let \(s\) represent the cost of a steak and \(c\) represent the cost of a chicken.</p>
<p>Use this information to answer questions 1 and 2.</p>
