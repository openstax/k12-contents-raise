<h4><span lang="EN">Adding Two
        Equations in a Real-World Situation</span></h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s
    look at the situation described and write a system of equations.</p>
<p>Paulina went to the pool 8 times and the skating rink 4 times this month. She spent a total of $128 on admission to both places. Last month, she went to the pool 3 times and the skating rink 4 times. Last month she spent $83 on admission to both places.</p>
<p>Let \(p\)&nbsp;represent the cost of the pool and \(s\)&nbsp;represent the cost of the skating
    rink.</p>
<p><u>This Month</u><span lang="EN">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Last Month</u></span></p>
<p>\(8p
    + 4s = 128\) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(3p
    + 4s = 56\)</p>
<p>So, this system represents the constraints in this situation:</p>
<p>\(\left\{\begin{array}{l}8p+4s=128\\\;3p+4s=83\end{array}\right.\)</p>
<p><span lang="EN">Over both months, she went to the pool 11 times and the skating rink 8 times. She spent a total of \($128 + $83\), or \($211\), over both months.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>The equation that represents this total is \(11p + 8s = 211\). Notice this is the equivalent of adding the like terms of the two equations in the system of equations.</p><p><span lang="EN">Let&rsquo;s
        solve the original system and determine if the solution also applies to this
        new equation.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Using
        substitution, we find that the solution is \((9, 14)\), or the pool costs $9 and
        the skating rink costs $14.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Substitute
        these values into the new equation:</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\(11p + 8s = 211\)</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">\(11(9) + 8(14) = 211\)</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\(99 + 112 = 211\)</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\(211 = 211\)&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN">&checkmark;</span><span lang="EN"></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Adding
        the equations together produces a new equation that has the same solution.</span></p>

<p>Alicia is a chef for a restaurant. This week, she ordered 32 steaks and 45 chickens. The total cost this week was $840. Last week, she ordered 32 steaks and 24 chickens. The total cost was $672.</p>
<p>Let \(s\)&nbsp;represent the cost of a steak and \(c\)&nbsp;represent the cost of a chicken. </p>
<p>Write a system of equations to represent the constraints given. Then write a new equation that represents the total cost for both weeks.</p>

<p>Here is how to write the system and the new equation: </p>
<p>The system of equations to represent this situation is:<br>\(32s + 45c = 840\)<br>\(32s + 24c = 672\)</p>
<p>By adding the equations, the new equation is:<br>\(64s + 69c = 1,512\)</p>
