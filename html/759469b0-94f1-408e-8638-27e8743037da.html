<h4> Comparing Real-Life Functions</h4>
<p>Two people, Adam and Bianca, are competing to see who can save more money in one month. Use the table and the graph below to determine who will save more money at the end of the month. State how much money each person had at the start of the competition. (Assume each is following a linear function in his or her saving habit.) Let Adam&rsquo;s function be represented by \(A(t)\), where \(t\) is days, and Bianca&rsquo;s function be represented by \(B(t)\).</p>

<p><img alt="TWO FUNCTIONS REPRESENTING SAVINGS IN DOLLARS AS A FUNCTION OF NUMBER OF DAYS FOR TWO PEOPLE: ADAM AND BIANCA. THE TOTAL AMOUNT ADAM HAS SAVED IS REPRESENTED BY THE GRAPH OF A LINE THAT PASSES THROUGH THE POINTS (0, 3) AND (2, 9). THE TOTAL AMOUNT BIANCA HAS SAVED IS REPRESENTED BY THE GRAPH OF A LINE THAT PASSES THROUGH THE POINTS (0, 2) AND (2, 8).

<p>Which is greater, \(A(2)\) or \(B(2)\)? Explain what this answer means.</p>
<p>\(A(2)=9\) and \(B(2)=8\), so after 2 days, Adam has saved more money.</p>

<p>Here is how to determine who went a greater distance:</p>
<p>Aleph traveled farther in 40 minutes. Comparing the graphs, \(A(40)\) is 5.5 miles, and \(S(40)\) is approximately 2.5 miles.</p>
<p>How did you do? Know that you learn more from wrong answers than from right answers! Wrong answers help us find flaws in our thinking. Take a minute to think about <em>why</em> you got the question wrong. Then you won&rsquo;t get this type of question wrong again!</p>
