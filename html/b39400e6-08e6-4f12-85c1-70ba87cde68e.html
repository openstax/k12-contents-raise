<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students compare linear and exponential growth in a context involving simple and compound interest.
  The initial balances are chosen so that the two options stay pretty close for small values of time. The intersection
  of their graphs is far enough from 0 that it is not easily noticed with only a few calculations. The graph for simple
  interest is linear. The graph for compound interest is exponential, but it is relatively flat for small values of
  time. As the domain values increase, students may notice that the values of the two options get closer and closer, or
  they may notice from the graph that the gap between the two graphs gets smaller.</p>
<p>Look for students who make different choices for the investment option because the better option would depend on the
  length of investment, which is unspecified. As in the case of the genies&rsquo; offers in the opening lesson, simple
  interest is better if the investment term is short, but compound interest becomes increasingly more favorable as time
  passes. Some students may not recognize this until they graph the two functions in the last question. Identify
  students who decide to change their earlier choice and can defend the change. Ask them to share later.</p>
<h4> Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Encourage students to think quietly about the questions before conferring with their
  partner. Provide access to graphing technology.</p>

Use this routine to support reading comprehension of this word problem. Use the first read to orient students to
    the situation. Ask students to describe what the situation is about without using numbers (a family is choosing
    between investing money with simple or compound interest). Use the second read to identify quantities and
    relationships. Ask students what can be counted or measured without focusing on the values. Listen for, and amplify,
    the important quantities that vary in relation to each other in this situation: years of investment and amount of
    money. After the third read, ask students to brainstorm possible strategies to answer the questions. This helps
    students connect the language in the word problem and the reasoning needed to solve the problem.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>A family has $1,000 to invest and is considering two options: investing in government bonds that offer 2% simple
  interest, or investing in a savings account at a bank, which charges a $20 fee to open an account and pays 2% compound
  interest. Both options pay interest annually.</p>
<p>Here are two tables showing what they would earn in the first couple of years if they do not invest additional
  amounts or withdraw any money.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The family should choose bonds if they are investing for less than 12 years. After 12 years, the savings
    account contains $1,242.88 because this is the value from \(980 \cdot (1.02)^{12} \). And, the bonds are worth
    $1,240 after 12 years because \(1,000 + 20(12)\) is the value.</li>
  <li>The family should choose the savings account if they are saving for something long term like college or
    retirement. This is because over time, the savings account will contain more money than the bonds have earned.
    For instance, after 20 years, the savings account holds $1,456.23 from \([980 \cdot (1.02)^{20}]\) while the
    bonds only yield $1,400 from \([ 1,000 + 20(20)]\).</li>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may have trouble choosing an option without additional information. Ask them to think about what might make
  sense for their own family or to give circumstances that would justify a choice.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Consider surveying the class to see the choices students made. Select students who made different choices to explain
  their responses, starting with those who opted for the bonds. Display their reasoning and graphs for all to see. If no
  students consider a time frame beyond 8 or 9 years, ask students which option would be better if the money could be
  left alone for 20 years. Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;How does the fee for the savings account affect the function?&rdquo; (It reduces the account balance, at
    the beginning, by $20. In the equation, there is a subtraction of 20.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;Where can we see the fees on the graph?&rdquo; (The vertical intercept of the graph for the savings account
    is at 980, which is 20 less than 1,000.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;When might the bonds be the better investment, if ever?&rdquo; (When the investment is shorter than a
    decade because that is when the savings account surpasses it.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;When might the savings account be the better investment, if ever?&rdquo; (When it is left for more than 10
    years, after the compounding effects of interest make up for the initial fees.) </li>
</ul>
<p>Point out that the exponential function here (the balance of the savings account) has a relatively slow rate of
  growth. It takes it a relatively long time before it overtakes the linear function, but it eventually does.</p>

<p>In each situation, the inputs or \(x\)-values are increasing by 1 each time. These can also be called consecutive
  terms.</p>
<p>If you have consecutive terms, then:</p>
<ul>
  <li> If the difference between their corresponding outputs or \(y\)-values is always the same constant, then the
    input-output pairs in the table can be modeled by a linear function. </li>
  <li> If the quotient between their corresponding outputs or \(y\)-values is always the same constant, then the
    input-output pairs in the table can be modeled by an exponential function. A growth rate greater than one means that
    it is exponential growth, and a growth rate between zero and one means that it is exponential decay. </li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible for a table to be a set of values that is not any of these relationships.</p>
<p>Using this information you can see that in Table A, \(\frac{\frac{1}{4}}{ \frac{1}{2}}=\frac12\). This holds true for
  the quotient of every other set of consecutive terms, too. Since the quotient is always the same, Table A represents
  an exponential function. Since the growth rate is \(\frac12\), or between zero and one, Table A represents exponential
  decay.</p>
<p>In Table B, the quotient of consecutive terms is not the same, but there is a common difference. The difference
  between the first two terms is \(2.5 -1.4=1.1\). This holds true for each of the other pairs of consecutive terms, so
  Table B represents a linear relationship.</p>
<p>In Table C, the quotient of consecutive terms is \(\frac{60}{30}=2\). This relationship holds true for all of the
  pairs of consecutive terms, which means this table represents an exponential relationship. Since the growth factor is
  greater than one, Table C represents exponential growth.</p>

<h5>Solution</h5>
<p> Here is how to determine which table is exponential growth:</p>
<p>When looking for exponential growth, remember that each \(y\)-value should be greater than the previous one. By first
  checking for growth, you can eliminate Table B and Table D. In Table B, each term is less than the first one, so it is
  not exponential growth. In Table D, the values increase and decrease, so it is not exponential growth, either.</p>
<p>Next, check for connections between consecutive terms. In Table A, \(2+6= 8\) and \(2 \cdot 4=8\). Since there seems
  to be the possibility of either a linear relationship or exponential growth, you need to check the next set of terms.
  Since \(8 \cdot 4 \neq 14\) and \(8+6 =14\), the relationship in Table A is linear, not exponential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means the answer should be Table C, but we should always check to confirm. If we check consecutive terms in
  Table C for a growth factor, we get the following: \(\frac {16}{4}=4\), \(\frac{64}{16}=4\), and \(\frac{256}{64}=4\).
  This proves that the growth factor is 4 and Table C represents exponential growth.</p>
