<p>Imagine you are at a park. This park has a large water fountain. In this fountain, streams of water shoot up and arc from the middle to the edge of the fountain&rsquo;s pool. The streams of water always land inside the pool. How does this work?</p>
<p>Also at this park, you see a group of children playing catch with a ball. What do the fountain and the kids playing with the ball have in common?</p>
<p>The answer? Quadratic equations!</p>
<p>Watch the video to learn a bit about how we can see quadratic equations in everyday things, from water fountains to playing with a ball.</p>

<p>In this unit, you will learn about quadratic equations. Understanding quadratic equations can help you understand the world around you. For example, they can be used to determine the maximum height a thrown ball will reach and the time it takes for the ball to hit the ground.</p>
<h4>Building Character: Curiosity</h4>
<p>In the video, you learned that Juan David Crespo used quadratic equations to plan how high and far each stream of water will go in a fountain. But how exactly does he do it? Are you interested in learning more?</p>
<p>Throughout this unit, you will work on developing your <strong>curiosity</strong>. Curiosity is the desire to learn and understand new things. When you are curious about something, you process it on a deeper level than just basic understanding. People typically spend more time learning about things they are curious about and more readily remember the information. Curious people tend to be happier individuals.</p>
<p>Think about your current sense of curiosity. How many of the following statements are true for you?</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> I got so absorbed in learning that I lost track of time. </li>
<li> I took the initiative to learn more about one of my interests. </li>
<li> When I didn&rsquo;t know the answer to a question, I couldn&rsquo;t rest until I figured it out. </li>
<li> I explored a completely new idea or topic&mdash;just for the fun of it. </li>
</ul>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry if none of these statements are true for you. Developing this trait takes time. Your first step starts today!</p>
