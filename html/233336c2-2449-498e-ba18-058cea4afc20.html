<h4>Optional Activity</h4>
<p>Your teacher will give you either a problem card or a data card. Do not show or read your card to your partner.</p>
<p>If your teacher gives you the data card:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> Silently read the information on your card. </li>
<li> Ask your partner, "What specific information do you need?" and wait for your partner to ask for information. Only give information that is on your card. (Do not figure out anything for your partner!) </li>
<li> Before telling your partner the information, ask, "Why do you need to know (that piece of information)?" </li>
<li> Read the problem card and solve the problem independently. </li>
<li> Share the data card and discuss your reasoning. </li>
<li> Pause here so your teacher can review your work. Ask your teacher for a new set of cards and repeat the activity (steps 1&ndash;5) for the next problem, trading roles with your partner. </li>
<li> When you and your partner have solved both problems, enter your answers to the questions below. </li>
</ol>
<p>If your teacher gives you the problem card:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> Silently read your card and think about what information you need to answer the question. </li>
<li> Ask your partner for the specific information that you need. </li>
<li> Explain to your partner how you are using the information to solve the problem. </li>
<li> When you have enough information, share the problem card with your partner, and solve the problem independently. </li>
<li> Read the data card and discuss your reasoning. </li>
<li> Pause here so your teacher can review your work. Ask your teacher for a new set of cards and repeat the activity (steps 1&ndash;5) for the next problem, trading roles with your partner. </li>
<li> When you and your partner have solved both problems, enter your answers to the questions below. </li>
</ol>
<p>The following are copies of the four cards you used to solve each of the problems. Choose the card that has the matching information you used to solve each problem.</p>
<h5>Problem Card 1</h5>
<strong> </strong>
<p>Kiran was timing the flight of his toy rocket.&nbsp; It launches straight up from the ground.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> At how many seconds after launch did the rocket reach the highest point? </li>
<li> The rocket was 8.8 feet above ground on the way up and again on the way down. How many seconds passed between the two times it was 8.8 feet above ground? </li>
</ol>
<h5><strong>Problem Card 2</strong></h5>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> How many feet above the ground did the toy rocket go? </li>
<li> Jada suggested they put Kiran&rsquo;s rocket on a platform and then launch the rocket from there. Will the rocket reach 20 feet above ground at its highest point? </li>
</ol>
<strong> </strong>
<h5>Data Card 1</h5>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> The stopwatch showed 0 seconds when the toy rocket blasted off from the ground. </li>
<li> It landed back on the ground when the stopwatch showed 1.6 seconds.&nbsp; </li>
<li> The second time the rocket reached 8.8 feet, the stopwatch showed 1.1 seconds.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<h5>Data Card 2</h5>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> The equation modeling the the height of Kiran&rsquo;s toy rocket was y=-16x(x-16). </li>
<li> \(y\) represents the height above ground in feet, and \(x\) represents time in seconds.&nbsp; </li>
<li> The platform is 4 feet above ground. </li>
</ul>
