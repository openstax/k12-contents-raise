<h4>Warm Up (10 minutes)</h4>
<p></p>
<p>In this warm-up, experiment with the graphical effects of
  multiplying both sides of an equation in two variables by a factor.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students are prompted to multiply one equation in a
  system by several factors to generate several equivalent equations. They then
  graph these equations on the same coordinate plane that shows the graphs of the
  original system. Students notice that no new graphs appear on the coordinate
  plane and reason about why this might be the case.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The work here reminds students that equations that are
  equivalent have all the same solutions, so their graphs are also identical.
  Later, students will rely on this insight to explain why we can multiply one
  equation in a system by a factor&mdash;which produces an equivalent equation&mdash;and
  solve a new system containing that equation instead.</p>

  <h4>Launch</h4>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Display the equation \( x+5=11 \) for all to see. Ask students:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>"What is the solution to this
    equation?" \( (x=6) \)
  </li>
  <li>"If we multiply both sides of the equation
    by a factor, say, 4, what equation would we have?" \( (4x + 20 = 44) \) "What is the solution to this new equation?"
    \( (x = 6) \)
  </li>
  <li>What if we multiply both sides by 100?"
    \( (100x+500=1,100) \) "By 0.5?" \( (0.5x+2.5=5.5) \)
  </li>
  <li>"Is the solution to each of these equations
    still \( x=6 \)?" (Yes)
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Remind students that these equations are one-variable
  equations, and that multiplying both sides of a one-variable equation by the
  same factor produces an equivalent equation with the same solution. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Ask students: "What if we multiply both sides of a
  two-variable equation by the same factor? Would the resulting equation have the
  same solutions as the original equation?" Tell students that they will now
  investigate this question by graphing. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2&ndash;4 and provide access to
  graphing technology to each group. To save time, consider asking group members
  to divide up the tasks. (For example, one person could be in charge of graphing
  while the others write equivalent equations, and everyone analyze the graphs
  together.)</p>

  <h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Consider two equations in a system:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col"><span>\( \left\{ \begin{array}{c l} 4x+ y=1\\ x+2y=9 \end{array}\right. \)<span> </span></span></th>
      <th scope="col"><span>Equation A<br>Equation B</span></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>1. Use graphing
  technology to graph the equations. Then, identify the coordinates of the
  solution.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Write
  a few equations that are equivalent to equation A by multiplying both
  sides by the same number, for example, 2, -5, or
  \( \frac{1}{2} \)&nbsp;. Let&rsquo;s call the resulting equations A1, A2, and
  A3.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>
<p></p>
<p>3. Graph the equations
  you generated. Make a couple of observations about the graphs.</p><br>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>
  <p></p>
  <h4>Student Response</h4>

<p>2. Answers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><span>A1: \( 8x+2y=2 \)</span></li>
  <li><span>A2: \(&nbsp;-20x-5y=-5&nbsp;\)

  <li><span>A3:&nbsp;\( 2x+ \frac{1}{2} y= \frac{1}{2}&nbsp;\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>3. No
  new graphs appeared. The graphs of the equivalent equations are identical to
  that of Equation A. The graphs all intersect the graph of Equation B at (1,
  -5).<br>
</p>
<div>
  <p></p>
  <h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Invite students to share their observations about the graphs they created. Ask students why the graphs of equations A1, A2, and A3 all coincide with the graphs of the original equation A. Discuss with students:</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>"How can we explain the identical
    graphs?" (Equations A1, A2, and A3 are equivalent to equation A, so they
    all have the same solutions as equation A, and their graphs are the same lines
    as the graphs of A.)
  </li>
  <li>"What move was made to generate A1, A2, and
    A3? Why did it create equations that are equivalent to A?" (The two sides
    of equation A was multiplied by the same factor, which keeps the two sides
    equal.)
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>To further
  illustrate that equations A1, A2, and A3 are equivalent to equation A, and if
  time permits, consider:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li><span>Using tables to visualize the identical&nbsp;</span><span>\( (x, y) \)</span><span> pairs. For example:</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Reminding students that, earlier in the unit,
  they saw that isolating one variable is a way to see if two equations are
  equivalent. If we isolate \( y \) in equations A, A1, A2, and A3, the rearranged
  equation will be identical: \( y=-4x+1 \).</p>
