<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Write inequalities that represent the constraints in a situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities </strong>that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2.8.1: Understanding Inequality Symbols<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you recalled the meaning of inequality symbols (&lt;, &gt;, &le;, and &ge;) and the meaning of "solutions to an inequality." You were reminded that an inequality in one variable can have a range of values that make the statement true. You also explored the value that is at the boundary of an inequality and consider whether it is or isn't a solution to an inequality.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>2.8.2: Identifying Constraints in Inequalities<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you were prompted to interpret several inequalities that represent the constraints in a situation. To explain what the letters in the inequalities mean in the given context, you could not simply match the numbers in the verbal descriptions and those in the inequalities. You worked to attend carefully to the symbols and any operations, and reason both quantitatively and abstractly.</li>

    </ul>

  <li>2.8.3: Writing Inequalities to Represent Constraints<ul>
      <li>Previously, you interpreted given inequalities and made sense of them in terms of a situation. In this activity, you wrote inequalities to represent the constraints in a situation. You identified key quantities and relationships, and thought about ways to represent them.</li>

    </ul>

  <li>2.8.4: Writing More Inequalities</li>
  <li>In this activity, you wrote inequalities to represent the number of pounds of grapes that a person could buy in a given situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
