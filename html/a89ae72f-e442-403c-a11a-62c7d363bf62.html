<h3>Activity (10 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students begin to complete the square. They start by transforming given perfect squares from standard form to factored form, and vice versa. Then, they are given an incomplete expression in standard form that contains only the squared term and linear term. Students need to decide what constant term makes the expression a perfect square, and then write the equivalent expression in factored form. To accomplish these tasks, students must rely on the structure they noticed in an earlier lesson about the relationship between the standard and factored forms of perfect squares.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Give students a few minutes of quiet time to think individually and then ask them to discuss their responses with their partner. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>

<br>
<p>Notice that finding the value of \(c\) helped to create a perfect square trinomial. This is called completing the square.</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>If students have trouble determining the constant term in standard form, suggest that they draw a rectangular diagram and work backward to determine the factors along the two sides of the rectangle. Afterward, they can find the corresponding value of the constant term.</p>
<p>For example, for the expression \(x^2&minus;20x+\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\) we would write:</p>
<table class="os-raise-standardtable">
  <colgroup>
    <col width="55">
    <col width="62">
    <col width="63">
  </colgroup>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td align="center"></td>
      <td align="center">
        <p>\(x\)</p>
      </td>
      <td align="center"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">
        <p>\(x\)</p>
      </td>
      <td align="center">
        <p>\(x^2\)</p>
      </td>
      <td align="center">
        <p>\(-10x\)</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center"></td>
      <td align="center">
        <p>\(-10x\)</p>
      </td>
      <td align="center"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<p>Which leads to the completed diagram:</p>

<p>This diagram represents the expression \(x^2&minus;20x+100\) (in standard form) and the expression \((x&minus;10)^2\) (in factored form).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Display the incomplete table for all to see. Ask students to complete the missing values or expressions.</p>
<p>Discuss how students knew what numbers or expressions to write in the last four pairs of expressions. Make sure students understand that:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> If the constant term in the factored form is \(n\), the constant term in standard form is \(n^2\), a squared number. </li>
  <li> The coefficient of the linear term in standard form is twice \(n\), or \(2n\). </li>
  <li> This means that \(n\) is half of the coefficient of the linear term. If the linear term is \(20x\), the \(n\) is 10, and the constant term in standard form is \(10^2\)or 100. </li>
  <li> If the linear term in standard form is \(bx\) (as in the last row of the table), then the constant term in standard form is \((\frac{b}{2})^2\), and the constant term in factored form is \(\frac{b}{2}\). </li>
</ul>
<p>Explain to students that finding the constant term to add in order to create a perfect square is called "completing the square." In the next activity, we will look at completing the square as a strategy to solve quadratic equations.</p>

<h4>Completing the Square</h4>
<p>When a number is added to a quadratic expression to make a perfect square trinomial, that is called completing the square.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is how to complete the square of a quadratic expression, \(ax^2+bx+c\).</p>
<div class="os-raise-graybox">
  <p><strong>How to Complete a Square of</strong> \(x^2+bx\)</p>
  <p>Step 1<br>
    Identify \(b\), the coefficient of \(x\).</p>
  <p>Step 2<br>
    Find half of \(b\) and then square it. In other words, \((\frac{b}{2})^2\).</p>
  <p>Step 3<br>
    Add the \((\frac{b}{2})^2\) to \(x^2+bx\).</p>
  <p>Step 4<br>
    Factor the perfect square trinomial, writing it as a binomial squared.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Complete the square to make a perfect square trinomial. Then write the result as a binomial squared.</p>
<p>\(x^2-26x\)</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Identify \(b\), the coefficient of \(x\).<br>
  The coefficient of \(x\) is -26.</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Find half of \(b\) and then square it. In other words, \((\frac{b}{2})^2\).<br>
  \((-\frac{26}{2})^2=(13)^2=169\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Add the \((\frac{b}{2})^2\) to \(x^2+bx\).<br>
  \(x^2-26x+169\)</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  Factor the perfect square trinomial, writing it as a binomial squared.<br>
  \((x-13)^2\)&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to complete the square.</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
