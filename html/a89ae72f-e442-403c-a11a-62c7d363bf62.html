<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students begin to complete the square. They start by transforming given perfect squares from
  standard form to factored form, and vice versa. Then, they are given an incomplete expression in standard form that
  contains only the squared term and linear term. Students need to decide what constant term makes the expression a
  perfect square, and then write the equivalent expression in factored form. To accomplish these tasks, students must
  rely on the structure they noticed in an earlier lesson about the relationship between the standard and factored forms
  of perfect squares.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Give students a few minutes of quiet time to think individually and then ask them
  to discuss their responses with their partner. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>

Write the studentsâ€™ words on a visual display and update it throughout the remainder of the lesson. Refer back to the visual display during the activity synthesis to reiterate key ideas.

    <p>Use color and annotations to illustrate student thinking. As students share their conclusions about the relationship between the terms in different forms of perfect squares, scribe their thinking on a visible display. Choose one example from the table. Highlight the coefficient of the linear term in the standard form expression, labeling it \(n\), then highlight the constant term in the standard form expression and write \((n/ 2)^2\). Finally, write \(n/2\) next to the constant term in the factored form expression and highlight it in the same color. Encourage students to select and annotate another example from the table on their own to check for understanding.</p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>If students have trouble determining the constant term in standard form, suggest that they draw a rectangular diagram
  and work backward to determine the factors along the two sides of the rectangle. Afterward, they can find the
  corresponding value of the constant term.</p>
<p>For example, for the expression \(x^2&minus;20x+\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\) we would write:</p>
<table class="os-raise-doubleheadertable os-raise-skinnytable">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col"></th>
      <th scope="col">
        \(x\)
      </th>
      <th scope="col"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">
        \(x\)
      </th>
      <td>
        \(x^2\)
      </td>
      <td>
        \(-10x\)
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"></th>
      <td>
        \(-10x\)
      </td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<p>Which leads to the completed diagram:</p>
<table class="os-raise-doubleheadertable os-raise-skinnytable">
  <thead>

    <tr>
      <th scope="col"></th>
      <th scope="col">

<p>This diagram represents the expression \(x^2&minus;20x+100\) (in standard form) and the expression \((x&minus;10)^2\)
  (in factored form).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Display the incomplete table for all to see. Ask students to complete the missing values or expressions.</p>
<p>Discuss how students knew what numbers or expressions to write in the last four pairs of expressions. Make sure
  students understand that:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> If the constant term in the factored form is \(n\), the constant term in standard form is \(n^2\), a squared
    number. </li>
  <li> The coefficient of the linear term in standard form is twice \(n\), or \(2n\). </li>
  <li> This means that \(n\) is half of the coefficient of the linear term. If the linear term is \(20x\), the \(n\) is
    10, and the constant term in standard form is \(10^2\)or 100. </li>
  <li> If the linear term in standard form is \(bx\) (as in the last row of the table), then the constant term in
    standard form is \((\frac{b}{2})^2\), and the constant term in factored form is \(\frac{b}{2}\). </li>
</ul>
<p>Explain to students that finding the constant term to add in order to create a perfect square is called "completing
  the square." In the next activity, we will look at completing the square as a strategy to solve quadratic equations.

<h4>Completing the Square</h4>
<p>When a number is added to a quadratic expression to make a perfect square trinomial, that is called completing the
  square.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is how to complete the square of a quadratic expression, \(ax^2+bx+c\).</p>
<div class="os-raise-graybox">
  <p><strong>How to Complete a Square of</strong> \(x^2+bx\)</p>
  <p>Step 1<br>
    Identify \(b\), the coefficient of \(x\).</p>
  <p>Step 2<br>
    Find half of \(b\) and then square it. In other words, \((\frac{b}{2})^2\).</p>
  <p>Step 3<br>
    Add the \((\frac{b}{2})^2\) to \(x^2+bx\).</p>
  <p>Step 4<br>
    Factor the perfect square trinomial, writing it as a binomial squared.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Complete the square to make a perfect square trinomial. Then write the result as a binomial squared.</p>
<p>\(x^2-26x\)</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Identify \(b\), the coefficient of \(x\).<br>
  The coefficient of \(x\) is -26.</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Find half of \(b\) and then square it. In other words, \((\frac{b}{2})^2\).<br>
  \((-\frac{26}{2})^2=(-13)^2=169\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Add the \((\frac{b}{2})^2\) to \(x^2+bx\).<br>
  \(x^2-26x+169\)</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  Factor the perfect square trinomial, writing it as a binomial squared.<br>
  \((x-13)^2\)&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Try It: Completing the Square</h4>

<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to complete the square.</p>
