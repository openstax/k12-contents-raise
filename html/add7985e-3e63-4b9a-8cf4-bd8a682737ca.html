<h4>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this warm up, students use graphing technology to graph simple linear inequalities in two variables. They practice adjusting the graphing window until the solution regions become visible and give useful information. Later in the lesson, students will write inequalities that represent constraints in different situations and find the solution sets. The exercises here prepare students to do the latter using graphing technology.</p>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<p>Give students access to graphing technology. If using Desmos:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explain to students that typing "\( &lt; = \) " gives the \( \le \) symbol and typing "\( &gt; = \)" gives the \( \ge \) symbol.</li>
  <li>Remind students that the \( + \) and \( - \) buttons can be used to zoom in and out of the graphing window, and that the wrench button in the upper right corner can be used to set the graphing window precisely.</li>
</ul>
<p>If using other graphing technology available in your classroom:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Demonstrate how to enter the \( \leq \) and \( \geq \) symbols.</li>
  <li>Remind students how to set a useful graphing window by zooming in or out, and how to set a precise graphing window by specifying the horizontal and vertical boundaries.</li>
  <li>(For technology that takes only equations or inequalities in slope-intercept form:) Remind students that some inequalities might need to be rewritten such that \( y \) is isolated before the inequality can be entered into the graphing tool.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Graph each inequality. Adjust the graphing window as needed to show meaningful information. (Students were provided access to Desmos.)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Use the graphing tool or technology outside the course. Graph the inequality \( y &gt; x \). Students were provided access to Desmos.</li>

<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>Display the correct solution regions for all to see and ask students to check their graphs. Discuss any challenges students may have come across when trying to graph using technology.</p>
<p>Explain to students that they will now use graphing technology to find solutions to some inequalities that represent constraints in situations</p>
