<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>
<p>At a fabric store, fabrics are sold by the yard. A dressmaker spent $36.35 on 4.25 yards of silk and cotton fabrics for a dress. Silk is $16.90 per yard, and cotton is $4 per yard.</p>
<p>Here is a system of equations that represents the constraints in the situation.</p>
<p><span>\(
    \displaystyle \begin{cases} \begin {align} x + \hspace{2.2mm} y &amp;=
    \hspace{2mm} 4.25\\ 16.90x + 4y &amp;= 36.35 \end{align} \end{cases} \)</span></p>

<h3><span>Response to Student Thinking</span></h3>
<h4><span>More Chances&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p>The cool-down in lesson 2.4 gives another opportunity for students to discuss the meaning of a solution in context, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
