<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>At a fabric store, fabrics are sold by the yard. A dressmaker spent $36.35 on 4.25 yards of silk and cotton fabrics for a dress. Silk is $16.90 per yard, and cotton is $4 per yard.</p>
<p>Here is a system of equations that represents the constraints in the situation.</p>
<p>\(\displaystyle \begin{cases} \begin {align} x + \hspace{2.2mm} y &amp;=
  \hspace{2mm} 4.25\\ 16.90x + 4y &amp;= 36.35 \end{align} \end{cases} \)</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    What does the solution to the system represent?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. The solution represents the combination of lengths of silk and cotton (in yards) that meet both constraints: they add up to 4.25 yards, and the cost of buying both is $36.35.</p>

<ol start="2">
  <li>
    Find the solution to the system of equations.&nbsp;
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>1.5 yards of silk and 2.75 yards of cotton.</p>

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    Explain or show how you know.
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The graphs of the equations intersect at&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>\((1.5,2.75)\).

  <li>  Solving by using a table gives \(x=1.5\) and \(y=2.75\).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>The cool-down in lesson 2.4 gives another opportunity for students to discuss the meaning of a solution in context, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
