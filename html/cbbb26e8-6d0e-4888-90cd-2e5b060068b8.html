<h4>Graphing Linear Inequalities</h4>
<p><br>
  What number would make the inequality \(x &gt; 3\) true? Are you thinking, &ldquo;\(x\) could be 4&rdquo;? That&rsquo;s correct, but \(x\) could be 6, too, or 37, or even 3.001. Any number greater than 3 is a solution to the inequality \(x &gt; 3\). We show all the solutions to the inequality \(x &gt; 3\) on the number line by shading in all the numbers to the right of 3, to show that all numbers greater than 3 are solutions. Because the number 3 itself is not a solution, we put an open circle at 3. <br>
</p>
<p>We can also represent inequalities using <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">interval notation</span>. There is no upper end to the solution to this inequality. In interval notation, we express \(x &gt; 3\) as \((3, &infin;)\). The symbol &infin; is read as &ldquo;<span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">infinity</span>.&rdquo; It is not an actual number.
  
  The figure below shows both the number line and the interval notation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(x &gt; 3\)<br>

</p>
<p>We use the left parenthesis symbol, (, to show that the endpoint of the inequality is not included. The left bracket symbol, \( [ \), shows that the endpoint is included.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  The inequality \( x &le; 1 \) means all numbers less than or equal to 1. Here, we need to show that 1 is a solution, too. We do that by putting a bracket at \( x = 1 \). We then shade in all the numbers to the left of 1, to show that all numbers less than 1 are solutions. See the figure below.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\( x &le; 1 \)<br>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-17ab7c97-7fff-0e49-3be6-d15506d843a8">There is no lower end to those numbers. We write \(x &le; 1 \) in interval notation as \( (&minus;&infin;,1] \). The symbol &minus;\( &infin; \) is read as &ldquo;negative infinity.&rdquo; The figure below shows both the number line and interval notation.</p>
