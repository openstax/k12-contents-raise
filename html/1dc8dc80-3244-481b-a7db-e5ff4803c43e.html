<h4>Real-World Applications</h4>
<p>In this unit, students write and graph equations to represent two constraints in the same problem situation. They use the graphs to see possible values that satisfy the constraints. The work prompts them to think about a pair of values that simultaneously meets multiple constraints in the situation, which in turn helps them make sense of the phrase &ldquo;a solution to both equations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Streaming Company A charges $15 per month plus $3 per new release movie. Streaming Company B charges $10 per month plus $5 per new release movie. The system of equations represents this situation.</p>
<p>\(\left\{\begin{array}{l}y\;=\;3x\;+\;15\\y\;=\;5x\;+\;10\end{array}\right.\)</p>
<br>
<p>Here are the graphs that represent the situation.</p>
<p><img alt="equations y = 3x + 15 labeled Company A and 5x + 10 labeled Company B; label points C(1, 18), D(1, 15), E(2.5, 22.5), F(5, 35" class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="324" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/d9c8fbc95bf3518b4edcd97aae95af71460f804a" width="350"><br></p><br>
<ul>
  <li>
  Points \(C\) \((1, 18)\) and \(G\) \((5, 30)\) are solutions of the equation \(y = 3x + 15\). Point \(C\) represents the total cost of $18 for the monthly fee plus 1 new release movie. </li>
  <li>
  Points \(D\) \((1, 15)\) and F \((5, 35)\) are solutions to the equation \(y = 5x + 10\). Point \(D\) represents the total cost of $15 for the monthly fee plus 1 new release movie. </li>
  <li>
  Point \(E\) \((2.5, 22.5)\) is a solution to both equations, and therefore a solution to the system. It means that the cost for both plans is $22.5 for the monthly fee plus 2.5 new release movies. In this case, you cannot stream part of a movie. However, you can see this is the point where costs are the same. </li>
  <li>
  To check that \((2.5, 22.5)\) is a solution to both equations, substitute 2.5 for \(x\) and 22.5 for \(y\) into both equations: </li>
  <ul>
    <li aria-level="2">\(
    y = 3x + 15\); \(22.5 = 3(2.5) +15\); \(22.5 = 7.5 + 15\); \(22.5 = 22.5 \)</li>
    <li aria-level="2">
    \(y = 5x + 10\); \(22.5 = 5(2.5) + 10\); \(22.5 = 12.5 + 10\); \(22.5 = 22.5 \)</li>
  </ul>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a task for you to try with your student:</p>
<p>Kalib is making trail mix. He spends $32 on 5 pounds of nuts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Each pound of peanuts, \(x\), costs $4. </li>
  <li>
  Each pound of cashews, \(y\), costs $8. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>The following system represents the situation. <br></p>
<p>\(\left\{\begin{array}{l}x + y = 5 \\4x + 8y = 32\end{array}\right.\)</p>
<p>Here are the graphs that represent the situation.</p>

  Which point or points are solutions to the equation \(x + y = 5\)? </li>

    2 pounds of peanuts and 3 pounds of cashews cost $32.
  </li>
  <li>
  Substitute 2 for \(x\) and 3 for \(y\) into each equation. </li>
  <li>

<h4>Video Lesson Summaries</h4>
<p>Here are the video lesson summaries for Unit 2: Linear Systems and Inequalities. Each video highlights key concepts and vocabulary that students learn across one or more lessons in the unit. The content of these video lesson summaries is based on the written Lesson Summaries found at the end of lessons in the curriculum. The goal of these videos is to support students in reviewing and checking their understanding of important concepts and vocabulary. Here are some possible ways families can use these videos:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Keep informed on concepts and vocabulary students are learning about in class.
  </li>
  <li>
    Watch with their students and pause at key points to predict what comes next or think up other examples of vocabulary terms.
  </li>
</ul>
