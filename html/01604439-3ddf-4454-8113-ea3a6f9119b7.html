<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>Previously, students saw that a squared expression of the form \((x+n)^2\) is equivalent to \(x^2+2nx+n^2\). This
  means that, when written in standard form \(ax^2+bx+c\) (where \(a\) is 1), \(b\) is equal to \(2n\) and \(c\) is
  equal to \(n^2\). Here, students begin to reason the other way around. They recognize that if \(ax^2+bx+c\) is a
  perfect square, then the value being squared to get \(c\) is half of \(b\), or \((\frac{b}{2})^2\). Students use this
  insight to build perfect squares, which they then use to solve quadratic equations.</p>
<p>Students learn that if we rearrange and rewrite the expression on one side of a quadratic equation to be a perfect
  square, that is, if we complete the square, we can find the solutions of the equation.</p>
<p>Rearranging parts of an equation strategically so that it can be solved requires students to make use of structure.
  Maintaining the equality of an equation while transforming it prompts students to attend to precision.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Comprehend that to "complete the square" is to determine the value of \(c\) that will make the expression
    \(x^2+bx+c\) a perfect square. </li>
  <li> Describe (orally and in writing) how to complete the square. </li>
  <li> Solve quadratic equations of the form \(x^2+bx+c=0\) by rearranging terms and completing the square. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Explain what it means to "complete the square" and describe how to do it. </li>
  <li> Solve quadratic equations by completing the square and finding square roots. </li>
</ul>

<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are
  only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.
  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and
    reinforce concept and language attainment
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(F) ask and give information ranging from using a very limited bank of high-frequency, high-need, concrete
    vocabulary, including key words and expressions needed for basic communication in academic and social contexts, to
    using abstract and content-based vocabulary during extended speaking assignments
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(G) express opinions, ideas, and feelings ranging from communicating single words and short phrases to
    participating in extended discussions on a variety of social and grade-appropriate academic topics
  </li>
</ul>
