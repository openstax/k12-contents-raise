<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>Most of the factored expressions students saw were of the form \((x + m)(x + n)\) or \(x(x + m)\). In this activity,
  students work with expressions of the form \((px + m)(qx + n)\). They expand expressions such as \((2x + 1)(x + 10)\)
  into standard form and look for structure that would allow them to go in reverse, that is, to transform expressions of
  the form \(ax^2+ bx + c\)
</p>
<p>Going from factored form to standard form is fairly straightforward given students' experience with the distributive
  property. Going in reverse, however, is a bit more challenging when the coefficient of \(x^2\) is not 1. With some
  guessing and checking, students should be able to find the factored form of the expressions in the fourth and fifth
  questions, but they should also notice that this process is not straightforward.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Remind students that they have seen quadratic expressions such as \(16t^2+ 800t + 400\) and \(5x^2+ 21x &minus; 20\),
  where the coefficient of the squared term is not 1. Solicit some ideas from students on how to write the factored form
  for expressions such as these.</p>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two to three and ask them to split up the work for completing the first three
  questions, with each group member rewriting one expression into standard form.</p>
<p>Invite students to share the expanded expressions in standard form. Record the expressions in the right column, and
  ask students to make observations about them.</p>
<p>If not mentioned by students, point out that each pair of factors start with \(3x\) and \(x\), which multiply to make
  \(3x^2\). Each pair of factors also has constant terms that multiply to make 4. The resulting expressions in standard
  form are all different, however, because using different pairs of factors of 4 and arranging them in different orders
  produce different expanded expressions.</p>
<p>Ask students to keep these observations in mind as they complete questions 4 and 5.</p>
<p>The student extension and the self check quiz contain examples in standard form where the trinomials have negative
  \(c\)-values. Ask students how having a negative \(c\)-value would affect the way they approach factoring. (The
  constants in the binomials must have opposite signs.)</p>

<p>This quadratic expression is different from those in the activity, since its leading coefficient has more than one
  set of possible factors.</p>
<p>Use the strategy you learned in the activity to factor the expression. If the pair of factors you selected using the
  leading coefficient, 6, do not give you the correct solution, begin again with another set of factors.</p>
<p>The expression is also different since the constant term is negative, -10. This means when you consider the factors
  of the constant term, one must be positive and one must be negative.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \((3x &minus; 2)(2x + 5)\) </p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may not think to check their answers to the second question and stop as soon as they think of a pair of
  factors that give the correct squared term and constant term. Encourage them to check their answers with a partner by
  giving time to do so. Consider providing a non-permanent writing surface or extra paper so students could try out
  their guesses and check their work without worrying about having to erase if they make a mistake the first time or
  two.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students to complete the missing expressions in standard form and to briefly explain their strategy. To
  rewrite \(ax^2+ bx + c\), students are likely to have tried putting different factors of \(a\) and of \(c\) in the
  factored expression such that when the factors are expanded, they yield a linear term with the coefficient \(b\).</p>
<p>Then, help students to reason about the factors more generally. Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> "To rewrite expressions such as \(x^2+ bx + c\), we looked for two numbers that multiply to make \(c\) and add up
    to \(b\). The expressions here are of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\). Are we still looking for two numbers that multiply
    to make \(c\)? Why or why not?" (Yes. The constant terms in the factored expression must multiply to make \(c\).)
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> "Do we need to look for factors of \(a\)? Why or why not?" (Yes. Those factors will be the coefficient of \(x\)
    in the factored expressions. They must multiply to make \(a\).) </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> "Are we still looking for two factors of \(c\) that add up to \(b\)? Why or why not?" (No. The value of \(b\) is
    no longer just the sum of the two factors of \(c\) because the two factors of \(a\) are now involved.) "How does
    this affect the rewriting process?" (It makes it more complicated, because now there are four numbers to contend
    with, and there are many more possibilities to consider.) </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell students that we'll investigate a bit further quadratic equations in the form of \(ax^2+ bx + c\) where \(a\) is
  not 1, and see if there are manageable ways to rewrite such equations in factored form so that they can be solved.</p>

<h4>Working with Expressions of the Form \((px + m)(qx + n)\)</h4>
<p>You have factored and solved many different types of quadratic equations, but the leading coefficient of the \(x^2\)
  term was often 1.</p>
<p>Let's look at the factored form of a more complex expression to better understand the process.</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 1</p>
<p>Write \((4x + 1)(x + 3)\) in standard form.</p>
<p>To find the quadratic expression in standard form, use the distributive property of multiplication over addition, or
  FOIL.</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}\left(4x+1\right)\left(x+3\right)&amp;=&amp; 4x^2+12x+x+3\\&amp;=&amp; 4x^2+13x+3\end{array}\)
</p>
<p>Now, let's try to go the other direction from standard form to factored form.</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 2</p>
<p>Write \(2x^2+ 13x + 15\) in factored form.</p>
<p>Since the leading coefficient is 2, we know the factored form must have the structure:</p>
<p>\((2x +\_\_\_)(x + \_\_\_)\)</p>
<p>Since the constant term is +15, the two missing numbers in the factored form must have a product of 15.</p>
<p>The possibilities include:</p>
<p> +1 and +15<br>
  +3 and +5<br>
  -1 and -15<br>
  -3 and -5</p>
<p>Since the middle term, \(13x\), is positive, we know that only the positive factors need to be considered.</p>
<p>Since the two factors are already different inside the parentheses, the order in which we place the numbers is
  important. We will try both, if necessary.</p>
<p>Let's try \({\style{color:red}1}\) and \({\style{color:red}1}{\style{color:red}5}\).</p>
<p>\(\left(2x+{\style{color:red}1}{\style{color:red}5}\right)\left(x+{\style{color:red}1}\right)\)<br>
  \(\begin{array}{rcl}&amp;=&amp;2x^2+2x+15x+15\\&amp;=&amp;2x^2+17x+15\end{array}\) <br> not equivalent to the original
  expression</p>
<p>Try reordering the same numbers.</p>
<p>
  \(\left(2x+{\style{color:red}1}\right)\left(x+{\style{color:red}1}{\style{color:red}5}\right)\)<br>\(\begin{array}{rcl}&amp;=&amp;2x^2+30x+x+15\\&amp;=&amp;2x^2+31x+15\end{array}\)<br>
  not equivalent to the original expression</p>
<p>Let's try \({\style{color:blue}3}\) and \({\style{color:blue}5}\).</p>
<p>\(\left(2x+{\style{color:blue}5}\right)\left(x+{\style{color:blue}3}\right)\)<br>
  \(\begin{array}{rcl}&amp;=&amp;2x^2+6x+5x+15\\&amp;=&amp;2x^2+11x+15\end{array}\)<br>
  not equivalent to the original expression</p>
<p>Try reordering the same numbers.</p>
<p>\(\left(2x + {\style{color:blue}3}\right)\left(x + {\style{color:blue}5}\right)\)<br>
  \(\begin{array}{rcl}&amp;=&amp;2x^2+ 3x + 10x + 15 \\
  &amp;=&amp;2x^2+ 13x + 15\end{array}\)<br>
  \({\style{color:red}\checkmark}\) equivalent to the original expression</p>
<p>So, the factored form of \(2x^2 + 13x + 15\) is \((2x + 3)(x + 5)\).</p>

<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p>Here is how to find the factored form:</p>

<p>-4 and 1<br>
  4 and -1<br>
  -2 and 2</p>
<p>Try -4 and 1.</p>
<p>\(\left(3x-4\right)\left(x+1\right)\)<br>\(\begin{array}{rcl}&amp;=&amp; 3x^2-4x+3x-4\\&amp;=&amp;
