  <li>
    A sequence is defined by \(f_1=-3\), \(f_n=f_{n-1}+0.5\) for \(n\geq2\). Diego writes an equation for the nth term of the sequence as \(a_n=-3+(n-1)(0.5)\). Is he correct? Explain how you know.
  </li>
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>
    <p>Yes. For example: Both definitions create a sequence that starts at &ndash;3 and increases by 0.5 each term.</p>

  <li>
    How would you describe the representation \(f_1=-3\), \(f_n=f_{n-1}+0.5\) for \(n\geq2\) for Diego&rsquo;s sequence?
  </li>
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>
    <p>It is the recursive definition of the sequence.</p>

  <li>
    How would you describe the representation of Diego&rsquo;s sequence, \(a_n=-3+(n-1)(0.5)\)?
  </li>
  <p> <strong>Answer: </strong>
    <p>This is the nth term of the sequence.</p>

<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
