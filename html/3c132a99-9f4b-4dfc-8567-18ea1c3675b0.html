<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>Your teacher will give you a set of cards that show scatter plots.</p>
<p>Arrange all the cards in three different ways. Ensure that you and your partner agree on each arrangement before moving on to the next one. Sort all the cards in order from:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="1">
  <li>best to worst for representing with a linear model</li>
  <li>least to greatest slope of a linear model that fits the data well</li>
  <li>least to greatest vertical intercept of a linear model that fits the data well</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>Know that the <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">line of best fit</span> is the line that provides the best fit to the data. It should follow the trend of the data and go through the middle of the data with a similar number of points on each side of the line.</p>
