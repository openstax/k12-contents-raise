<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students apply what they learned about transforming expressions into factored form to make sense of quadratic equations and persevere in solving them. They see that rearranging equations so that one side of the equal sign is 0, rewriting the expression in factored form, and then using the zero product property make it possible to solve equations that they previously could only solve by graphing. These steps also allow them to easily see&mdash;without graphing and without necessarily completing the solving process&mdash;the number of solutions that the equations have.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> Recognize that the number of solutions to a quadratic equation can be revealed when the equation is written as <em>expression in factored form </em>\(=0\).</li>
  <li> Use factored form and the zero product property to solve quadratic equations. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> Rearrange a quadratic equation to be written as <em>expression in factored form&nbsp;</em>\(=0\) and find the solutions. </li>
  <li> Recognize quadratic equations that have zero, one, or two solutions when they are written in factored form. </li>
</ul>
