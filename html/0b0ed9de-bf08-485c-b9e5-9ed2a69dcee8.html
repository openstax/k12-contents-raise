<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students apply what they learned about transforming expressions into factored form to make sense of
  quadratic equations and persevere in solving them. They see that rearranging equations so that one side of the equal
  sign is 0, rewriting the expression in factored form, and then using the zero product property make it possible to
  solve equations that they previously could only solve by graphing. These steps also allow them to easily
  see&mdash;without graphing and without necessarily completing the solving process&mdash;the number of solutions that
  the equations have.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Recognize that the number of solutions to a quadratic equation can be revealed when the equation is written as
    <em>expression in factored form </em>\(=0\).</li>
  <li> Use factored form and the zero product property to solve quadratic equations. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Rearrange a quadratic equation to be written as <em>expression in factored form&nbsp;</em>\(=0\) and find the
    solutions. </li>
  <li> Recognize quadratic equations that have zero, one, or two solutions when they are written in factored form. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A2(C) learn new language structures, expressions, and basic and academic vocabulary heard during classroom instruction and interactions</li>
  <li>A2(E) use visual, contextual, and linguistic support to enhance and confirm understanding of increasingly complex and elaborate spoken language</li>
  <li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
  <li>A3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions</li>
</ul>
