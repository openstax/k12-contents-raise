<p>In this lesson, you will extend your knowledge of transforming quadratic expressions from standard form into factored form. You will continue factoring with expressions that can be rewritten as products of a sum and a difference, \((x + m)(x &minus; n)\).</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Explain how the numbers and signs in a quadratic expression in factored form relate to the numbers and signs in an equivalent expression in standard form. </li>
  <li> Write an equivalent expression in factored form, given a quadratic expression in standard form with a negative constant term. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
