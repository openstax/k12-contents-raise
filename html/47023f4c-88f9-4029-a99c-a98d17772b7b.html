      <div class="body">
        <p>In this warm-up, students look for a relationship between two quantities by interpreting a verbal description and analyzing pairs of values in a table. They then use the observed relationship to find unknown values of one quantity given the other and to think about possible equations that could represent the relationship more generally (MP8).</p>
        <p>The work here reinforces the idea that the relationship between two quantities can be expressed in more than one way and that some forms might be more helpful than others, depending on what we want to know. In this context, for instance, if we know the area of a parallelogram and want to know its base length, the equation <span class="math math-repaired">\( b = \frac{A}{3} \)</span> is more helpful than <span class="math math-repaired">\( A=3b \)</span>.</p>

      <h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>
      <div class="body">The table shows the relationship between the base length, <span class="math math-repaired">\( b \)</span>, and the area, <span class="math math-repaired">\( A \)</span>, of some parallelograms. All the parallelograms have the same height. Base length is measured in inches, and area is measured in square inches. <img alt="image shows three parallelograms with dimensions as shown in the table." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="283" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/5d4504dfc43395c726ce06afb55cd8a9d0122ec1" width="300"><br></div>

      <h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>Some students may think that the height must be known before they could find the missing area or base. Encourage them to look for a pattern in the table and to reason from there.</p>

      <h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>Invite students to share their responses and explanations. Then, focus the whole-class discussion on the second question. Discuss with students:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>&ldquo;Are the two equations we chose equivalent? How do you know?&rdquo; (Yes. There is an acceptable move that takes one to the other. If we divide each side of <span class="math math-repaired">\( A=3b \)</span> by 3, we have <span class="math math-repaired">\( \frac{A}{3}=b \)</span>, which can also be written as <span class="math math-repaired">\( b=\frac{A}{3} \)</span>. If we multiply each side of <span class="math math-repaired">\( b=\frac{A}{3} \)</span> by 3, we have <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3b=A \)</span> or <span class="math math-repaired">\( A = 3b \)</span>.)</li>
          <li>&ldquo;If we know the base, which equation would make it easier to find the area? Why?&rdquo; (<span class="math math-repaired">\( A=3b \)</span>. The variable for area is already isolated. All we have to do is multiply the base by 3 to find the area.)</li>
          <li>&ldquo;If we know the area, which equation would make it easier to find the base? Why?&rdquo; (<span class="math math-repaired">\( b=\frac{A}{3} \)</span>. The variable for the base is already isolated. We can just divide the area by 3 to find the base.)</li>
