          <p>A biologist is trying to determine if a group of dolphins is a new species of dolphin or if it is a new group of individuals within the same species of dolphin. The biologist measures the width (in millimeters) of the largest part of the skull, zygomatic width, and the length (in millimeters) of the snout, rostral length, of 10 dolphins from the same group of individuals.</p>

        <p>The slope increased and the correlation coefficient got closer to 1. The&nbsp; \(y\) -intercept also change significantly.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I think it became moderately strong because the data point that was changed did not follow the roughly linear pattern of the other 9 data points, and when it was changed, it did follow the linear pattern more closely.</p>

            Changing the points to numbers well above or below the existing linear trend in the data makes the correlation coefficient get closer to zero.

            For example: I managed to get the&nbsp; \(r\) -value to 0.86 by changing the 2 values that appeared furthest from the line of best fit,&nbsp; &nbsp;( 272 , 184 ) &nbsp;and&nbsp; (272,161) , to values that are very close to the existing line of best fit,&nbsp; (272,168)&nbsp; &nbsp;and&nbsp; (272,168) .

            For example: By changing&nbsp; (247,147)&nbsp; &nbsp;to&nbsp; ( 247 , 1000 ) , I was able to change the relationship to a negative one because the line of best fit had a negative slope,&nbsp; \(ùë¶=-14.187ùë•+4071.1 \)
