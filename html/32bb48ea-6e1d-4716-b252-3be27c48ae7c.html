<p>Here are some key takeaways from this lesson to share with students:</p>
<ul>
  <li> An essential step in finding the GCF of two or more expressions is writing each of the expressions in expanded form as the multiplication of all of its prime factors. </li>
  <li> To find the GCF of two or more expressions, list all the factors of each expression. Then find the common factors that are in every expression. Multiply these factors together. </li>
  <li> To factor the GCF from a polynomial, first find the GCF of all of the terms in the polynomial. Then use the &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; of the Distributive Property to factor the GCF out of each expression in the polynomial. </li>
  <li> Sometimes there is not a common factor in every term of a polynomial. However, it can still be factored using a method called grouping. The terms of the polynomial are grouped together so that a GCF can be factored from the first part and another GCF can be factored from the second part. If the polynomial can be factored further, a common factor will emerge from both parts. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
