<p>Here are some key takeaways from this lesson to share with students:</p>
<ul>
<li> An essential step in finding the GCF of two or more expressions is writing each of the expressions in expanded form as the multiplication of all of its prime factors. </li>
<li> To find the GCF of two or more expressions, list all the factors of each expression. Then find the common factors that are in every expression. Multiply these factors together. </li>
<li> To factor the GCF from a polynomial, first find the GCF of all of the terms in the polynomial. Then use the &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; of the Distributive Property to factor the GCF out of each expression in the polynomial. </li>
<li> Sometimes there is not a common factor in every term of a polynomial. However, it can still be factored using a method called grouping. The terms of the polynomial are grouped together so that a GCF can be factored from the first part and another GCF can be factored from the second part. If the polynomial can be factored further, a common factor will emerge from both parts. </li>
