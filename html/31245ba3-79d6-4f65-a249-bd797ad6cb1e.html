<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students examine the successive heights that a tennis ball reaches after several bounces on a hard
  surface and consider how to model the relationship between the number of bounces and the height of the rebound. To do
  so, they need to determine the growth factor of successive bounce heights. Because some data are provided here,
  students engage in only some aspects of mathematical modeling. To engage students in the full modeling cycle that
  includes data gathering, consider asking students to measure the bounce heights of a ball, as suggested in the next
  optional activity.</p>
<p>Real-world data are often messy, and that is the case for the data provided here. Monitor for students who try the
  following approaches in deciding whether a linear or exponential model is more appropriate for modeling the data:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Use the table of values and look at successive differences. </li>
  <li> Use the table of values and look at successive quotients. </li>
  <li> Plot the points and observe the general trend in bounce height. </li>
  <li> Plot the points using graphing technology and use the technology to generate a line or curve of best fit. </li>
</ul>
<p>While each successive bounce height is about half of the preceding height, there is variation in the data, with the
  largest factor being a little more than 0.55 and the smallest a little less than 0.47. Monitor the way students choose
  to deal with this variation, which affects the model they consider appropriate. They may:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Decide that an exponential model is not appropriate because the growth factor is different from bounce to bounce.
  </li>
  <li> Make a rough approximation for the growth factor, for example, by observing that each bounce height \(h\) is
    about half the preceding bounce height: \(h=150\cdot\left(\frac12\right)^n\). </li>
  <li> Find and use the growth factor from the first two points: \(h=150\cdot\left(\frac8{15}\right)^n\). </li>
  <li> Take an average of the successive quotients: \(h=150\cdot\left(0.53\right)^n\). </li>
  <li> Use graphing technology to generate a regression equation: \(h=150.389\cdot\left(0.527\right)^n\). </li>
</ul>
<p>Select students who use these strategies to share during the discussion. Encourage those who do not think an
  exponential model is appropriate to look for an exponential model that best fits the given data.</p>
<p>Making graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2&ndash;4.</p>
<div class="os-raise-graybox">
  <h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
  <p> Use this routine to prepare students for the whole-class discussion. At the appropriate time, ask students to
    prepare a visual display that shows their mathematical thinking and reasoning for the first question. Invite
    students to quietly circulate and read at least 2 other posters or visual displays in the room. Give students quiet
    time to think individually to consider what is the same and what is different about the displays. Next, ask students
    to return to their group to discuss what they noticed. Listen for and amplify observations for choosing an
    exponential or linear model. This will help students interpret real-world data and provide justification for
    choosing an exponential model.</p>

      <li>An exponential function of the bounce height would decrease by the same factor for each successive bounce. It
        looks like each successive bounce is about half as high as the previous bounce, making an exponential model
        appropriate.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> Regulations say that a tennis ball, dropped on concrete, should rebound to a height between 53% and 58% of the
    height from which it is dropped. Does the tennis ball here meet this requirement? Be prepared to show your
    reasoning. <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.<br><br>
    <ul>
      <li> Yes. The first rebound is a little over 53%, the second is almost 54%, and the fourth is 55%. The third
        rebound is only about 47%, but there could be some measurement error. </li>
      <li> No, the third rebound is less than 50% of the height from which the tennis ball fell, falling out of the
        allowable range. </li>
      <li> It is not possible to tell. One of the values is too low, and the others are close enough to 53% that it is
        impossible to be sure whether the bounces of this ball fall within the regulations. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> Write an equation that models the bounce height \(h\) after \(n\) bounces for this tennis ball. <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. <br><br>\(
    h=150 \cdot (0.53)^n\) (A factor of exactly 0.5 is also acceptable, or any value between 0.53 and 0.58.)
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> About how many bounces will it take before the rebound height of the tennis ball is less than 1 centimeter? Be
    prepared to show your reasoning. <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. 8 bounces. For example:<br><br>
    <ul>
      <li> The height of the ball is decreasing by a factor of about \(\frac12\) after each bounce. So after 3 more
        bounces, it will decrease by a factor of about \(\frac18\) (giving a little more than 1 cm), but after 4 more
        bounces, it will decrease by a factor of about \(\frac{1}{16}\). </li>
      <li> Graphing \(
        h=150 \cdot (0.53)^n\) and \(h=1\) simultaneously using graphing technology shows the bounce height first goes
        below \(h=1\) on the 8th bounce. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use the graphing tool or technology outside the course. Graph the equation that models the bounce height \(h\) after \(n\) bounces for this tennis ball using the Desmos tool below. Students were provided access to Desmos.
    <br><strong>Answer:</strong><br><br>
    <p> <img alt="Graph the equation that models the bounce height h after n bounces for a tennis ball  " src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4ad91a245d0ae1ab03f0910ecd75c638156b209c" width="300"></p>
  </li><br>
  <li>Use the graph of the equation that models the bounce height \(h\) after \(n\) bounces for this tennis ball to predict the difference in height after 6 bounces.
    <br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>The difference in height after 6 bounces is 2.<br>
    Using the equation: <br>
    \(h=150 \cdot (0.50)^n\) and graphing \(h=150 \cdot (0.50)^6\). The graph shows the height to be 2.344 after 6 bounces \((n=6)\).
<br><br>
    This is consistent with the reasoning :
        <ul>
          <li>The height of the ball is decreasing by a factor of about 
          \( \frac{1}{2}\) after each bounce.</li>
            <li>After the 4th bounce, the height difference is 9. It should decrease by 
              \( \frac{1}{2}\) for each bounce after that. So, after 2 more bounces (the 6th bounce), it will decrease by a factor of about \( \frac{1}{4}\). 
              The 6th bounce would be \(9 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \approx 2.25\).  </li>
            <li>Rounding either 2.344 or 2.25 results in the answer 2. </li>
        </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may not be comfortable with the data not fitting an exponential function exactly. Remind them that
  real-world data is messy, so, when modeling, we must do our best to approximate the data. If an exponential model does
  a good job at approximating the data and showing its general trend, then this is a reasonable model to use even though
  it does not accurately predict or match all of the data.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Ask students to share how they decided whether a linear or exponential function is more appropriate for modeling the
  data. Once the class concludes that a linear model is less suitable, select previously identified students to share
  how they determined a growth factor to use for their models and the resulting equations. Sequence the strategies being
  presented as shown in the Activity Narrative.</p>
<p>Connect the discussion about growth factors to the data and what the factors tell us about whether the tennis ball
  satisfies the bounce regulations. Ask questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Do most of the data support the conclusion?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How can we explain the third bounce?&rdquo; (E.g., it is too low, but there could have been a
    mis-measurement, or the tennis ball could have hit something on the floor.) </li>
</ul>
<p>To follow up on the last question, consider discussing the practical domain in this context. Ask, for instance:
  &ldquo;How long could we expect this behavior to continue? Can it go on indefinitely? What is a reasonable domain for
  our model?&rdquo;</p>
