<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students will work in a jigsaw format to solve a problem. They will then explain to members of other groups how they solved their problem. Facilitate a discussion after the activity where students describe their methods. Work to lead them into the relationship between the variables they used and how this is direct variation. The students will then work to solve their problem using the steps to writing a direct variation equation.<br></p>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<p>Have students work in groups of 2-3. Assign each group a problem (either 1, 2, OR 3). After the groups work through their problem, match one person from group 1, 2, and 3 together to form another group. They will then teach the new group their problem.<br></p>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement<br></h4>
<p>In your group, work through your assigned problem. Then be ready to share.</p>
<p>Group 1. When Raoul runs on the treadmill at the gym, the number of calories, \( c \), he burns varies directly with the number of minutes, \( m \), he uses the treadmill. He burned 315 calories when he used the treadmill for 18 minutes. Write the equation that relates \( c \) and \( m \).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Group 2. The number of calories, \( c \), burned varies directly with the amount of time, \( t \), spent exercising. Arnold burned 312 calories in 65 minutes exercising. Write the equation that relates \( c \) and \( t \).</p>
<p>Group 3. The distance a moving body travels, \( d \), varies directly with time, \( t \), it moves. A train travels 100 miles in 2 hours. Write the equation that relates \( d \) and \( t \).</p>
<h4>What is Direct Variation?</h4>
<p>All of these are examples of direct variation.</p>
<p>Two variables vary directly if one is the product of a constant and the other.</p>
<p>For any two variables x and \( y \), \( y \) varies directly with \( x \) if&nbsp;</p>
<div class="editor-indent"><span>
    <p>\( y=kx \), where \( k&ne;0 \)</p>
  </span></div><span>The constant k is called the constant of variation.<br></span><br>
<p>Look back at the problem you solved. Use the direct variation equation to solve it again using these steps:<br>

<h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>
<p>Make sure students understand the concept of input and output and the independent variable and dependent variable. Students will commonly switch the values that are substituted for \( x \) and \( y \) in the equation, which will result in an incorrect value for \( k \).<br></p>

<h3>Modeling Situations Using Direct Variation</h3>
<p>When two quantities are related by a proportion, we say they are proportional to each other. Another way to express this relation is to talk about the variation of the two quantities. We will discuss direct variation here.</p>
<p>Lindsay gets paid $15 per hour at her job. If we let s be her salary, in dollars per hour, and h be the number of hours she has worked, we could model this situation with the equation</p>
<p>\( s=15h \)</p>
<p>Lindsay&rsquo;s salary is the product of a constant, 15, and the number of hours she works. We say that Lindsay&rsquo;s salary varies directly with the number of hours she works. Two variables vary directly if one is the product of a constant and the other.</p>
