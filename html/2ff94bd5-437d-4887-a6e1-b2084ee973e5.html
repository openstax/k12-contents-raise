<h4>Using a Table to Find the Pattern</h4>
<p>Sometimes it is helpful to keep a table to find the pattern needed to answer a question.</p>
<p>For the Tower of Hanoi game, enter the number of discs used and the smallest number of moves to solve the puzzle in a
  table like the one below. Use the answers from the activity.</p>
<table class="os-raise-horizontaltable">
  <thead></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Number of Discs
      </th>
      <td>
        3
      </td>
      <td>
        4
      </td>
      <td>
        5
      </td>
      <td>
        6
      </td>
      <td>
        7
      </td>
      <td>
        8
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">
        Number of Moves to Solve Puzzle
      </th>
      <td>
        7
      </td>
      <td>
        15
      </td>
      <td>
        31
      </td>
      <td>
        ?
      </td>
      <td>
        127
      </td>
      <td>
        ?
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The pattern was to double the previous answer and then add 1.</p>
<p>Using this pattern, complete the table for 6 discs.</p>
<p>\(2(31)+1=63\)</p>
<p>Then use this rule to find how many moves are needed to complete the puzzle with 8 discs.</p>
<p>There were 127 moves for 7 discs.</p>
<p>So, double 127 and add 1: \(2(127)+1=255\).</p>
<h4>Try It: Using a Table to Find the Pattern</h4>
<div class="os-raise-ib-cta" data-button-text="Solution" data-fire-event="Reveal1" data-schema-version="1.0">
  <div class="os-raise-ib-cta-content">
    <p>Now it&rsquo;s your turn. For the same game, how many moves would it take to solve the puzzle with 9 discs?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="os-raise-ib-cta-prompt">
    <p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to compare your work. </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="os-raise-ib-content" data-schema-version="1.0" data-wait-for-event="Reveal1">
  <p>Your answers may vary, but here are some examples:</p>
  <p>The pattern is still the same. Double the number of moves before and add 1.</p>
  <p>With 8 discs, 255 moves were needed.</p>
  <p>Double 255, and then add 1:</p>
  <p>\(2(255)+1=511\)</p>
</div>
