<h4>Using a Table to Find the Pattern</h4>
<p>Sometimes it is helpful to keep a table to find the pattern needed to answer a question.</p>
<p>For the Tower of Hanoi game, enter the number of discs used and the smallest number of moves to solve the puzzle in a table like the one below. Use the answers from the activity.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col>
<col>
<col>
<col>
<col>
<col>
<col>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p>Number of Discs</p></td>
<td><p>3</p></td>
<td><p>4</p></td>
<td><p>5</p></td>
<td><p>6</p></td>
<td><p>7</p></td>
<td><p>8</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Number of Moves to Solve Puzzle</p></td>
<td><p>7</p></td>
<td><p>15</p></td>
<td><p>31</p></td>
<td><p>?</p></td>
<td><p>127</p></td>
<td><p>?</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The pattern was to double the previous answer and then add 1.</p>
<p>Using this pattern, complete the table for 6 discs.</p>
<p>\(2(31)+1=63\)</p>
<p>Then use this rule to find how many moves are needed to complete the puzzle with 8 discs.</p>
<p>There were 127 moves for 7 discs.</p>
<p>So, double 127 and add 1: \(2(127)+1=255\).</p>
<h4>Try It: Using a Table to Find the Pattern</h4>
<div class="os-raise-ib-cta" data-button-text="Solution" data-fire-event="Reveal1" data-schema-version="1.0">
<div class="os-raise-ib-cta-content">
<p>Now it&rsquo;s your turn. For the same game, how many moves would it take to solve the puzzle with 9 discs?</p>
</div>
<div class="os-raise-ib-cta-prompt">
<p>In your notebook, write down your answer. Then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to check your work. </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="os-raise-ib-content" data-schema-version="1.0" data-wait-for-event="Reveal1">
<p>Your answers may vary, but here are some examples:</p>
<p>The pattern is still the same. Double the number of moves before and add 1.</p>
<p>With 8 discs, 255 moves were needed.</p>
<p>Double 255, and then add 1:</p>
<p>\(2(255)+1=511\)</p>
<p>How did you do? Know that you learn more from wrong answers than from right answers! Wrong answers help us find flaws in our thinking. Take a minute to think about <em>why</em> you got the question wrong. Then you won&rsquo;t get this type of question wrong again!</p>
