      <h3><span>Activity (20 minutes)</span><br></h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>This activity is the first of several that draw students&rsquo; attention to the structure of linear equations in two variables, how it relates to the graphs of the equations, and what it tells us about the situations. </p>
        <p>Students start by interpreting linear equations in standard form, <span class="math math-repaired">\( Ax+By=C \)</span>, and using them to answer questions and create graphs. They see that this form offers useful insights about the quantities and constraints being represented. They also notice that graphing equations in this form is fairly straightforward. We can use any two points to graph a line, but the two intercepts of the graph (where one quantity has a value of 0) can be found quickly using an equation in standard form.</p>
        <p>Students then analyze the graphs to gain other insights. They determine the rate of change in each relationship and find the slope and vertical intercept of each graph. Next, they rearrange the equations to isolate <span class="math math-repaired">\( y \)</span>. They make new connections here&mdash;the rearranged equations are now in slope-intercept form, which shows the slope of the graph and its vertical intercept. These values also tell us about the rate of change and the value of one quantity when the other quantity is 0.</p>

      <h3>Launch</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>Tell students that they will now interpret some other equations about games and rides. They will also use graphs to help make sense of what combinations of games and rides are possible given certain prices and budget constraints.</p>
        <p>Read the opening paragraph in the task statement and display the three equations for all to see. Give students a minute of quiet time to think about what each equation means in the situation and then discuss their interpretations. Make sure students share these interpretations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Equation 1: Games and rides cost <span>$</span>1 each, and the student is spending <span>$</span>20 on them.</li>
          <li>Equation 2: Games cost <span>$</span>2.50 each, and rides cost <span>$</span>1 each. The student is spending <span>$</span>15 on them.</li>
          <li>Equation 3: Games cost <span>$</span>1 each, and rides cost <span>$</span>4 each. The student is spending <span>$</span>28 on them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Arrange students in groups of 3&ndash;4. Assign one equation to each group (or ask each group to choose an equation). Ask them to answer the questions for that equation.</p>
        <p>Give students 7&ndash;8 minutes of quiet work time and then a few minutes to discuss their responses with their group and resolve any disagreements. Ask groups that finish early to answer the questions for a second equation of their choice. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>

        <div class="c-annotation c-annotation--ell">
          <em>Conversing: MLR2 Collect and Display. </em>During the launch, listen for and collect language students use to describe the meaning of the three equations. Record a written interpretation next to each of the three equations on a visual display. Use arrows or annotations to highlight connections between specific language of the interpretations and the parts of the equations. This will provide students with a resource from which to draw language during small-group and whole-group discussions.<br><em>Design Principle(s): Maximize meta-awareness; Support sense-making</em>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For numbers 1&ndash;7, use the equation \(x + y = 20\) which represents the relationship between the number of games, \(x\), the number of rides, \(y\), and the dollar amount a student is spending on games and rides at an amusement park.</p>

<!--START QUESTION 1-->	
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">

<!--START QUESTION 10-->	
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="10">
  <li>Rearrange the equation to solve for \(y\).</li>

<!--START QUESTION 11-->	
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="11">
  <li>What connections, if any, do you notice between your new equation and the graph?</li> 
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>The new equation shows where the graph intersects the \(y\)-axis at 20, so if the student plays 0 games, they have the money to go on 20 rides. Since the slope of the graph is \(-1\), for every 1 fewer ride they go on, they can play 1 game.</p>
