<p dir="ltr">In this lesson, you will continue to examine methods of writing an equation of a line. In recent lessons, you learned that the method you use to write the equation of a line is determined by the information given. You will continue to use those methods along with the relationship between slopes of lines.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Write an equation of a line parallel to a given line.</li>
  <li>Write an equation of a line perpendicular to a given line.</li>
  <li>Write an equation of a line parallel or perpendicular to an axis.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
