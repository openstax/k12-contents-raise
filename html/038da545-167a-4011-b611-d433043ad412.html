<h4>Part 3: Using an Area Model</h4>
<p>Use the Explore Screen and Generic Screen to answer the following questions. </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<p><li>Suppose we want to find the product of 17 and 13 using an area model.</li>
<ol type="a"><li>Draw and label your partitions on the scaled area model below.</li>
<img height="300" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c0583c1e3de5ec8d5c2fb9f56878104dfede8ff0"/>
<li>Draw and label your partitions on the generic model below. </li>
<img alt="A diagram with a large rectangle divided into four sections, two small rectangles above and to the left, one small slightly larger rectagle above the two small ones above and to the left.  Lines seperate the single box from the smaller boxes on the top and to the left. The top line is green.  The left line is blue." height="200" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/5d7078d0d035592651c72ffe93732201515db380"/>
</ol></p>
<p><li>ðŸ’¬ Discuss with your group: How does your area model compare to those in your group? What is the same? What is different? </li>
</p>
<p><li>Justify how you know your model represents 17x13. Does your area model represent 17âœ•13? How do you know? ðŸ’¬</li>
</p>
</ol>
<p><li>Challenge yourself to work through levels 1-2 of the <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/area-model-multiplication/latest/area-model-multiplication_en.html?screens=3" target="_blank">Area Model Numbers</a> Game!</li></p>
<p><li>What are three different ways you could partition 17?</li>

<p><li>Write your own 2-digit times 2-digit multiplication problem that uses an area model, and find the total area. </li></p>
<img alt="A diagram with a large rectangle divided into four sections, two small rectangles above and to the left, one small slightly larger rectagle above the two small ones above and to the left.

<p><li>What is a convenient way to break up a multiplication problem into an area model, and why is it convenient for you?</li></p>
<h3>Part 4: Applying an Area Model </h3>
<p>Use the Variables Screen to answer the following questions.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent"><li>Play around with entering your own variable expressions, then answer the following. </li>
<ol type="a">
<p>
<li>In an area model, how do the partial products (interior numbers) get calculated?</li>
<li>In an area model, how does the total area get calculated?</li>
<li> How do the partial products relate to the total area of the area model? </li>
</p>
</ol>
<p>
<li>Use the sim to model 6(x+8).<br/>
<img alt="A diagram with five rectangles: one at the top center, two below it side by side, one to the left, and a large rectangle split in half at the bottom. A green horizontal line spans the top rectangles." height="200" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/cf7bbb114082fb67e2ec1cc3f07fee7d54a3858a"/></li></p>

<p>
  What is the total area of this rectangle? Represent the total area in multiple ways.ðŸ’¬

</p>
<p>
<li>
    Use the sim to model (x+3)(x-5).<br/>
<img alt="A diagram with a large rectangle divided into four sections, two small rectangles above and to the left, one small slightly larger rectagle above the two small ones above and to the left.

The left line is blue." height="200" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/6b94112d13fd4e2278fecf9f89d55f70d1566205"/> <br/>
    What is the total area of this rectangle? Represent the total area in multiple ways. ðŸ’¬
  </li>
</p>
<p><li>Challenge yourself to work through levels 1 - 4 of the Area Model Algebra Game! </li></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><li>How is multiplying <em>variable expressions</em> using an area model similar to multiplying <em>numbers</em> using an area model?</li> </p>
</ol>
<h3>Extension</h3>
<p>Challenge yourself to work backwards and factor an algebraic expression! 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="A rectangle is divided into two vertical sections labeled 4x and 12. There are three smaller squares: one above each section and one to the left of the rectangle." height="200" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/1d32b5338797703fac22f95c26199b0e97ec744a"/>

The Area Model sim is playing tricks on you! It gives you the partial products, but not the side lengths. What numbers and/or variables must be on the outside of this rectangle? </p>
