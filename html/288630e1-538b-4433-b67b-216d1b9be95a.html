<h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>
<p>This lesson reinforces the concept of the solution of a system of two linear equations. Students are also asked to write systems of equations from a table of values and connect that to a graph of a system of equations using technology.</p>
<p>Students then write the systems of equations from a graph and solve the system using the graph. In the cool down, students will explore how a system of equations represents a real world problem.</p>
<p>Making internet-enabled devices available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p>
<ul>
  <li> (2A) distinguish sounds and intonation patterns of English with increasing ease </li>
  <li> (2B) recognize elements of the English sound system in newly acquired vocabulary such as long and short vowels, silent letters, and consonant clusters </li>
  <li> (3A) practice producing sounds of newly acquired vocabulary such as long and short vowels, silent letters, and consonant clusters to pronounce English words in a manner that is increasingly comprehensible </li>
  <li> (4A) learn relationships between sounds and letters of the English language and decode (sound out) words using a combination of skills such as recognizing sound-letter relationships and identifying cognates, affixes, roots, and base words </li>
  <li> (4B) recognize directionality of English reading such as left to right and top to bottom </li>
  <li> (4H) read silently with increasing ease and comprehension for longer periods </li>
  <li> (4J) demonstrate English comprehension and expand reading skills by employing inferential skills such as predicting, making connections between ideas, drawing inferences and conclusions from text and graphic sources, and finding evidence supporting text evidence commensurate with content area needs </li>
  <li> (5C) spell familiar English words with increasing accuracy, and employ English spelling patterns and rules with increasing accuracy as more English is acquired </li>
  <li> (5D) edit writing for standard grammar and usage, including subject-verb agreement, pronoun agreement, and appropriate verb tenses commensurate with grade-level expectations as more English is acquired </li>
  <li> (5E) employ increasingly complex grammatical structures in content area writing commensurate with grade-level expectations </li>
  <ul>
    <li> (5Ei) using correct verbs, tenses, and pronouns/antecedents </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h4>Support for Building Character</h4>
<p>Throughout this unit, find ways to encourage and support students to work on cultivating their <strong>growth mindset.</strong></p>
<p>Here are some tips to try during this lesson:</p>
