<p id="fs-id1168345252532">An equation that contains two unknown quantities or two quantities that vary is called an equation in two variables. A solution to such an equation is a pair of numbers that makes the equation true.</p>
<p id="fs-id1168345252532">Suppose Tyler spends $45 on T-shirts and socks. A T-shirt costs $10, and a pair of socks costs $2.50. If&nbsp;\( ùë° \) represents the number of T-shirts and&nbsp;\( ùëù \) represents the number of pairs of socks that Tyler buys, we can can represent this situation with the equation:</p>
<p id="fs-id1168345252532">\( 10t+2.50p=45 \)<br></p>
<p id="fs-id1168345252532">This is an equation in two variables. More than one pair of values for \( t \) and \( p \) make the equation true.</p>
<p id="fs-id1168345252532">\(&nbsp;t=3&nbsp;\) and \(&nbsp;p=6&nbsp;\)<br><span>\(&nbsp;10(3)+2.50(6)=45&nbsp;\)<br></span><span>\(&nbsp;30+15=45&nbsp;\)<br></span><span>\(&nbsp;45=45&nbsp;\)</span></p>
<p id="fs-id1168345252532">\(&nbsp;t=4&nbsp;\) and \(&nbsp;p=2&nbsp;\)<br><span>\(&nbsp;10(4)+2.50(2)=45&nbsp;\)<br></span><span>\(&nbsp;40+5=45&nbsp;\)<br></span><span>\(&nbsp;45=45&nbsp;\)</span></p>
<p id="fs-id1168345252532">\(&nbsp;t=2&nbsp;\) and \(&nbsp;p=10&nbsp;\)<br><span>\(&nbsp;10(2)+2.50(10)=45&nbsp;\)<br></span><span>\(&nbsp;20+25=45&nbsp;\)<br></span><span>\(&nbsp;45=45&nbsp;\)</span></p>
<p id="fs-id1168345252532">In this situation, one constraint is that the combined cost of shirts and socks must equal $45. Solutions to the equation are pairs of \(&nbsp;t&nbsp;\) and \(&nbsp;p&nbsp;\) values that satisfy this constraint.</p>
<p id="fs-id1168345252532">Combinations such as \(&nbsp;t=1&nbsp;\) and \(&nbsp;p=10&nbsp;\) or \(&nbsp;t=2&nbsp;\) and \(&nbsp;p=7&nbsp;\) are not solutions because they don&rsquo;t meet the constraint. When these pairs of values are substituted into the equation, they result in statements that are false.</p>
