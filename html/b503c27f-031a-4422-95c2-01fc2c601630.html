<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>The purpose of this activity is for students to create another representation of a given sequence and to give them an opportunity to use the vocabulary they have learned for geometric and arithmetic sequences.</p>
<p>Monitor for students who create Mai&rsquo;s graph to understand her reasoning and for students who reason about whether the sequence is defined by a rate of change or a growth factor to invite to share during the discussion.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement </h4>
<p>Jada and Mai are trying to decide what type of sequence this could be:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col width="114">
<col width="55">
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>term number</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>value</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>1</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>2</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>2</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>6</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>5</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>18</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><br>
<p>Jada says: &ldquo;I think this sequence is geometric because in the value column, each row is 3 times the previous row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mai says: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is geometric. I graphed it, and it doesn&rsquo;t look geometric.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do you agree with Jada or Mai? Explain or show your reasoning using a graph.</p>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<p>Sample response: I agree with Mai. Jada noticed that each value is multiplied by 3 to get to the next row, but the table skips terms. If the sequence were geometric, it would have to be 2, 6, 18, 54, 108. When Mai made a graph, she could see the gap in the sequence.</p>

<p>Without knowing the missing terms, we don&rsquo;t know for sure if the sequence is arithmetic, but it could be since the three given points are all on the same line with slope 4. The missing points could be \((3,10)\) and \((4,14)\) so that the sequence would be 2, 6, 10, 14, 18.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite previously selected students to share their reasoning, displaying any graphs created for all to see. If the idea of slope or average rate of change does not come up, ask students how they could have found the missing points for an arithmetic sequence just given \((2,6)\) and \((5,18)\). Draw in the slope triangle and show the computation for the average rate of change.</p>
<h3>4.15.3: Self Check</h3>
<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p>Which two terms could be next in the sequence to make it arithmetic?</p>
<p>5, 8, ____, ____</p>

<p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p>12.8, 7.68</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: These would be the next two terms if the sequence were geometric. The answer is 11, 14.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>11, 14</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct! Check yourself: The common difference from 5 to 8 is 3, so continue to add 3 to find the next two terms.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>13, 20</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: This is the result of adding 3, then 5, and then 7. The common difference remains the same in an arithmetic sequence. The answer is 11, 14.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>13, 21</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: This is the result of adding the two previous terms. This sequence does not have a common difference. The answer is 11, 14.</p>

<h4>Creating a Sequence</h4>
<p>For a sequence: 1, 3, . . .</p>
<p>Write the next two terms that would make the sequence</p>
<ol>
<li>
    geometric
  </li>
<li>
    arithmetic
  </li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>
    To make the sequence geometric, there must be a common ratio.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>\(1\cdot3=3\), so use a common ratio of 3 to multiply each term by.</p>
<p>The sequence becomes: 1, 3, 9, 27 . . .</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
    To make the sequence arithmetic, there must be a common difference.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>\(3-1=2\), so use a common difference of 2 to add to each term.</p>
<p>The sequence becomes: 1, 3, 5, 7 . . .</p>
<h4>Try It: Creating a Sequence</h4>
<p>Write the next two terms to create an arithmetic sequence.</p>
<p>2, 6, . . .</p>
<p>In your notebook, write down your answer. Then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to check your work.</p>
<h5> Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to create an arithmetic sequence given two terms:</p>
<p>Find the common difference by subtracting the first term from the second term:</p>
<p>\(6-2=4\)</p>
<p>The common difference is 4.</p>
<p>Add 4 to the previous term to find the next terms.</p>
<p>The sequence becomes: 2, 6, 10, 14 . . .</p>
