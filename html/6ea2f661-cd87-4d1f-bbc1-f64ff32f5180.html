<p>Why does \(f(20) = f(22)\)?</p>
<p>Since section B is not changing, it represents the period of time where the store did not receive new shipments, so \(f(20)=f(22)\).</p>

<p>Here is how to describe what \(B(9)=98\) represents in the context of the problem:</p>
<p>\(B(9)=98\) represents the maximum amount of money Jameson had in his account over the time period shown. It also represents that after 9 days, Jameson had $98 in his account. It is the maximum because it is the highest point on the graph provided.</p>
