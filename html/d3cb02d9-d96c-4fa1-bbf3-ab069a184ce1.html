<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>Here are some pairs of equations. While one partner listens, the other partner should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choose a pair of equations from column A. Explain why, if&nbsp;<span>\( x \)</span>&nbsp;is a number that makes the first equation true, then it also makes the second equation true.</li>
  <li>Choose a pair of equations from column B. Explain why the second equation is no longer true for a value of&nbsp;<span>\( x \)</span>&nbsp;that makes the first equation true.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, switch roles until you run out of time or you run out of pairs of equations.</p>
<p>Some principles you might use to complete this activity include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Distributive Property</li>
  <li>Commutative Property</li>
  <li>Addition Property of Equality</li>
  <li>Additive Inverse</li>

    <ol>
      <li>By the distributive property, \( 4(9&minus;x) \) is equal to \(&nbsp;36&minus;4x&nbsp;\) for any value of \(&nbsp;x\). If \(&nbsp;4(9&minus;x)&nbsp;\) is equal to \(16\), then \(&nbsp;36&minus;4x&nbsp;\) is also equal to \(16\).</li>
      <li>If the two sides of the equation are equal, then they are still equal if the same amount, in this case \(&nbsp;2x&nbsp;\), is subtracted from each side.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>\(&nbsp;-3(2x+9)&nbsp;\) divided by \(&nbsp;-3\) is \(&nbsp;2x+9&nbsp;\) and \(&nbsp;12&nbsp;\) divided by -\(&nbsp;3&nbsp;\) is \(&nbsp;-4&nbsp;\). Because \(&nbsp;-3(2x+9)&nbsp;\) is equal to \(&nbsp;12&nbsp;\), dividing each of them by \(&nbsp; -3&nbsp;\) gives the same result, so it is true that \(&nbsp;2x+9&nbsp;\) is equal \(&nbsp;&minus;4&nbsp;\).</li>
      <li>Subtracting by a number is equivalent to adding its opposite, so \(&nbsp;3&minus;x&nbsp;\) is equivalent to \(&nbsp;3+-x&nbsp;\). Changing the order in which we add two numbers doesn't change the sum, per commutative property of addition. If \(&nbsp;5x&nbsp;\) is equal to \(&nbsp;3+-x&nbsp;\), then it is also equal to \(&nbsp;-x+3&nbsp;\).</li>
      <li>Using the commutative property, \(&nbsp;3x&minus;6+x&nbsp;\) can be rewritten as \(&nbsp;3x+x&minus;6&nbsp;\). Combining like terms gives an equivalent expression, \(&nbsp;4x&minus;6&nbsp;\), so \(&nbsp;4x&minus;6&nbsp;\) is also equal to \(&nbsp;18&nbsp;\).</li>

      <li><span>If the expressions \(&nbsp;9x&nbsp;\) and \(&nbsp;5x+4&nbsp;\) are equal, then adding \(&nbsp;5x&nbsp;\) to one expression and subtracting \(&nbsp;5x&nbsp;\) from the other make the two expressions unequal.</span></li>
      <li><span>The 9 on the right side of the equation is multiplied by 2. If the expression on the left side was also multiplied by 2, the two sides would stay equal, but only a part of the expression on the left is doubled, so the two sides of the equation are no longer equal.</span></li>
      <li><span>If two expressions are equal, dividing one side by 6 but not dividing the other side by 6 makes them unequal.</span></li>
      <li><span>The left side of the first equation is divided by \(&nbsp;-11&nbsp;\) but the right side is being added by 11. Performing two different operations with different numbers on the same value may not keep an equation true.</span></li>
      <li><span>Subtracting 4 from two values that are equal keeps the equation true. The expression on the left was multiplied (or divided) by \(&nbsp;-1&nbsp;\), however, the expression on the right was not, so the two expressions are no longer equal.</span></li>
