<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>Here are some pairs of equations. While one partner listens, the other partner should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choose a pair of equations from column A. Explain why, if \( x \) is a number that makes the first equation true, then it also makes the second equation true.</li>
  <li>Choose a pair of equations from column B. Explain why the second equation is no longer true for a value of \( x \) that makes the first equation true.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, switch roles until you run out of time or you run out of pairs of equations.</p>
<p>Some principles you might use to complete this activity include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Distributive Property</li>
  <li>Commutative Property</li>
  <li>Addition Property of Equality</li>
  <li>Additive Inverse</li>

<p>Compare your answer:Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.</p>
 <p>Column A: For example:</p>    
    
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
      <li>By the distributive property, \( 4(9&minus;x) \) is equal to \( 36&minus;4x \) for any value of \( x\). If \( 4(9&minus;x) \) is equal to \(16\), then \( 36&minus;4x \) is also equal to \(16\).</li>
      <li>If the two sides of the equation are equal, then they are still equal if the same amount, in this case \( 2x \), is subtracted from each side. </li>
      <li>\( -3(2x+9) \) divided by \( -3\) is \( 2x+9 \) and \( 12 \) divided by -\( 3 \) is \( -4 \). Because \( -3(2x+9) \) is equal to \( 12 \), dividing each of them by \(  -3 \) gives the same result, so it is true that \( 2x+9 \) is equal \( &minus;4 \).</li>
      <li>Subtracting by a number is equivalent to adding its opposite, so \( 3&minus;x \) is equivalent to \( 3+(-x) \). Changing the order in which we add two numbers doesn't change the sum, per commutative property of addition. If \( 5x \) is equal to \( 3+-x \), then it is also equal to \( -x+3 \).</li>
      <li>Using the commutative property, \( 3x&minus;6+x \) can be rewritten as \( 3x+x&minus;6 \). Combining like terms gives an equivalent expression, \( 4x&minus;6 \), so \( 4x&minus;6 \) is also equal to \( 18 \).</li>

 <p>Column B: For example:</p>
    
     <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
      <li>If the expressions \( 9x \) and \( 5x+4 \) are equal, then adding \( 5x \) to one expression and subtracting \( 5x \) from the other make the two expressions unequal.</li>
      <li>The 9 on the right side of the equation is multiplied by 2. If the expression on the left side was also multiplied by 2, the two sides would stay equal, but only a part of the expression on the left is doubled, so the two sides of the equation are no longer equal.</li>
      <li>If two expressions are equal, dividing one side by 6 but not dividing the other side by 6 makes them unequal.</li>
      <li>The left side of the first equation is divided by \( -11 \) but the right side is being added by 11. Performing two different operations with different numbers on the same value may not keep an equation true.</li>
      <li>Subtracting 4 from two values that are equal keeps the equation true. The expression on the left was multiplied (or divided) by \( -1 \), however, the expression on the right was not, so the two expressions are no longer equal.</li>
