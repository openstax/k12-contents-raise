<p>In this lesson, you will use familiar tools like tables and graphs to represent quadratic functions. These tools will help you discover that finding the sum of the partial areas in a rectangle is the same as applying the distributive property to multiply out the terms in each factor.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Rewrite quadratic expressions in different forms by using an area diagram or the distributive property. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
