<p><strong><em>Students will complete the following questions to practice the skills they have learned in this lesson.</em></strong></p>
<p>1. The graphs show the distance, \(d\), traveled by two cars, A and B, over time, \(t\). Distance is measured in miles and time is measured in hours. </p>
<p><img alt="Line graph with two straight lines, A and B, both starting at the origin. Line B has a steeper slope than line A. The x-axis is labeled t and the y-axis is labeled d, with increments marked on both axes." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/d71d8dc6f83c6c24781699b463b8e5790cc17f77"/></p>
<p>Which car traveled slower?</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
<li>
    Car A
  </li>
<li>
    Car B
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Car A traveled slower because Car B was a further distance in the same amount of time as car A:</p>
<p>For #2-5 use the graphs below to match each description of a situation in which the volume of water in a tank is a function of time to its corresponding graph. </p>

<p>For #6-7, use this situation and function:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The daily cost to the manufacturing company is modeled by the function </p>
<p>\(C(x)=7.25x+2500\) where \(C(x)\) is the total daily cost and \(x\) is the number of items manufactured.</p>
