<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>In the past few lessons, students have reasoned symbolically and formally about quadratic expressions. This activity ties that work back to the quadratic functions that represent situations from earlier in the unit.</p>
<p>Students are given two expressions that represent a familiar quadratic function. They identify these expressions by their form and justify why the two are equivalent, using what they learned about expanding factored expressions. Students also study the graph that represents the function and interpret the features of the graph in context. Students are asked to interpret the meaning of the horizontal and vertical intercepts rather than the \(x\)- and \(y\)-intercepts since these variables are not used to define the function.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Encourage and support opportunities for peer interactions. Invite students to talk about their ideas with a partner before writing them down.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>In an earlier lesson, we saw that an equation such as \(h(t)=10+78t-16t^2\) can model the height of an object thrown upward from a height of 10 feet with a vertical velocity of 78 feet per second.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Is the expression \(-16t^2+78t+10\) written in standard form? Explain your reasoning.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. It is a sum of a squared term, a linear term, and a constant term. Written in the form \(ax^2+bx+c\), &ndash; 16 is \(a\), 78 is \(b\), and 10 is \(c\).
  </li>
</ol>

  <li>Paola said that the equation \(g(t)=-2(8t+1)(t-5)\) also defines the same function, written in factored form. Is Paola correct? Explain your reasoning.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. Distribute the &ndash; 2 to \((8t+1)\) and you have \((-16t-2)\). Multiply this binomial by \((t-5)\). The result of \((-16t-2)(t-5)\) is \(-16t^2+78t+10\).
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li> Here is a graph representing both \(g(t)=-2(8t+1)(t-5)\) and \(h(t)=10+78t-16t^2\).<br>

  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3" type="a">
    <li> What do each of these points mean in this situation? <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Answer:</strong> The \(y\)-intercept shows the height, in feet, of the object when it was thrown, and the \(x\)-intercept shows the number of seconds that passed after the object was thrown before it hit the ground.
    </li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may not recognize that the quadratic terms are the same if they identify the squared term as \(16t^2\) rather than \(-16t^2\). Some may ignore the subtraction sign in \(10+78t-16t^2\), or associate it with the \(78t\) rather than the \(16t^2\). Show them a simpler problem expression such as \((5-10)\) and rewrite it as \(5+-10\). Then, ask them to rewrite the expression defining \(h\) in a similar way.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Make sure that:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Students see that the expression \(10+78t-16t^2\) is in standard form, even though it is written as \(c+bx+ax^2\). Clarify that &ndash; 16 is \(a\) (the coefficient of the squared term), 78 is \(b\) (the coefficient of the linear term), and 10 is \(c\) (the constant term). </li>
  <li> Students can explain the equivalence of \((-16t-2)(t-5)\) and \(10+78t-16t^2\) using a strategy from earlier lessons (for example, drawing a diagram or applying the Distributive Property). </li>
</ul>
<p>Ask students if they notice any connections between the two equations and the features of the graph. Some may notice the 10 in the standard form of the equation tells us the vertical intercept is \((0,10)\). Others may predict that the subtraction of 5 has something to do with the horizontal intercepts or may not see any connections. Any observation is fine at this point, as students will look closely at equations and graphs starting in the next activity.</p>

<h3>7.10.2: Additional Resources</h3>
<p><strong><em>The following content is available to students who would like more support based on their experience with the self check. Students will not automatically have access to this content, so you may wish to share it with those who could benefit from it.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<h4>Characteristics of Quadratic Graphs</h4>
<p>The graph of \(y=(x+1)(x-2)\) is shown below.</p>
<p>What are the \(x\)- and \(y\)-intercepts?</p>
<p><img height="229" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/54a6955212a1f8f48b663b2cabfabcf19dc386e8" width="225"></p>
<p>The \(x\)-intercepts are where the graph crosses the \(x\)-axis.</p>
<p>This happens at \((-1,0)\) and \((2,0)\).</p>
<p>The \(y\)-intercept is where the graph crosses the \(y\)-axis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This happens at \((0,2)\).</p>
<h4>Try It: Characteristics of Quadratic Graphs</h4>
<p>The graph of \(y=-(x-4)(x+1)\) is below.</p>
<p>What are the \(x\)- and \(y\)-intercepts of the graph?</p>
<p><img height="301" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/dc8c7185054a90c166a13dedaf849169a5f4f2ab" width="301"></p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to find the intercepts:</p>
<p>For the \(x\)-intercepts: Look at where the graph crosses the \(x\)-axis.</p>
<p>This happens at \(x = &ndash; 1\) and \(x = 4\). So the points are \((-1,0)\) and \((4,0)\).</p>
<p>For the \(y\)-intercept: Look at where the graph crosses the \(y\)-axis.</p>
<p>This happens at \(y = 4\) so the point is \((0,4)\).</p>
