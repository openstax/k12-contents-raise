<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Use the factored form of a quadratic expression or a graph of a quadratic function to answer questions about a situation. </li>
  <li> Write equivalent expressions in factored form when given quadratic expressions of the form \(ax^2+bx + c\) and \(a\) is not 1. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> 8.10.1: Analyzing Various Quadratic Expressions </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you analyzed different quadratic expressions and found the distinctions that made them unique. Being able to recognize detailed aspects of these expressions helps provide a better understanding that is useful when solving by factoring. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 8.10.2: Working with Quadratic Factored Form with Leading Coefficient Other Than One </li>
  <ul class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li> In this activity, you learned the process that is involved when attempting to factor a quadratic expression where the leading coefficient is not 1. By using a guess and check method, you were able to solve these expressions. </li>
    <li> 8.10.2: Self Check </li>
    <li> 8.10.2: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 8.10.3: Using Technology to Find Rational Factors </li>
  <ul class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li> In this activity, you applied graphing technology to solve complicated quadratic functions that were not factorable by other means, since the zeros were non-integer rational numbers. </li>
    <li> 8.10.3: Self Check </li>
    <li> 8.10.3: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 8.10.4: Finding the Factors of Quadratic Expressions in Standard Form </li>
  <ul class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li> In this optional activity, you learned two different methods to factor complicated quadratic equations with leading coefficients greater than 1. You learned to use one method when the leading coefficient was a perfect square and another method when it was not a perfect square. </li>
    <li> 8.10.4: Self Check </li>
    <li> 8.10.4: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 8.10.5: Solving Quadratic Equations by Any Method </li>
  <ul class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li> In this activity, you combined all of the skills you learned in the lesson to factor quadratic equations using any method you preferred. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
