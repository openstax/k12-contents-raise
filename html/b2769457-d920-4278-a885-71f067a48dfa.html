<h3>Warm Up (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>The goal of this opening activity is to activate, through a familiar context, what students know about functions from
  middle school.<br></p>
<p>Students first encounter a relationship in which two quantities&mdash;the number of bagels bought and price&mdash;do
  not form a function. They see that for some numbers of bagels bought, there are multiple possible prices. The
  quantities in the relationship between the number of bagels bought and the best price, however, do form a function
  because there is only one possible best price for each number of bagels.</p>
<p>Students contrast the two relationships by reasoning about possible prices, completing a table of values, and
  observing the graphs of the relationships.</p>

  Contrasting Two Relationships by Reasoning</a>
<p>Ask students to silently consider how each of the people mentioned in the scenario could be correct. You may wish for
  students to share their thinking with a shoulder partner and continue to work with that partner through the remainder
  of the activity.</p>
<p> Next, provide students with your Desmos class code so they may use it for the activity. In screen 1, students will
  be asked to create a table of the best price for the listed number of bagels. Next, in screens 2-4, students are
  provided with the table correctly filled out. Hannah's price is validated as the best price for 13 bagels, but
  students are asked to identify how the others could have arrived at their prices. As you monitor student conversations
  and responses, pause to display students' thinking. Be sure to highlight ideas that are different from others or have
  well worded responses. </p>
<p>In the last screen, students are asked to consider how a price list like the one in this scenario benefits a business
  owner and whether they like this type of pricing from a customer's point of view. Pause for a class discussion.</p>
<p>Desmos activities are different from the graphing calculator application because they lead students through one or
  more interactive tasks. As students progress through the activity, teachers may use the Teacher Dashboard to monitor
  student responses and use them for whole group discussion. Activities may also be set to identify student responses
  that are correct or incorrect. </p>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<p>Encourage students to use the provided sentence stems to support their written explanations for how each person in
  the scenario might have determined their price for 13 bagels. The stems will also prove useful if you ask students to
  share their thinking verbally.</p>
<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>
<p>If needed, chunk the building of the table into stages. First, suggest students fill in values for the prices that
  are given. For instance, students would enter the cost for 1 bagel, 6 bagels, 9 bagels, and 12 bagels using the values
  from the price list. Next, prompt students to consider how much one bagel costs. Have them add that amount to each
  table entry that follows the given amounts. For instance, have them determine the costs to purchase 2-5 bagels. Then,
  determine the costs to buy 7 or 8 bagels, etc. </p>
<p>Finally, to assist with determining how the other costs were obtained by the store worker, Jaime, and Pedro, ask
  students to identify pairs of numbers that sum to 13. For instance, 12 bagels + 1 bagel. Then match the price for each
  pair.</p>

  <p>A customer at a bagel shop is buying 13 bagels. The store worker says, &ldquo;That would be $16.25.&rdquo;<br>
    Jaime, Pedro, and Hannah, who are in the shop, all think it is a mistake.
  <ul>
    <li>Jaime says, &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t the total be $13.25?&rdquo;</li>
    <li>Pedro says, &ldquo;I think it should be $13.00.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>Hannah says, &ldquo;No, I think it should be $11.25.&rdquo;</li>
  </ul>
  <br>Consider how the store worker, Jaime, Pedro, and Hannah could all be right.

<p>In the following activity, you will be asked to use the pricing information displayed at the bagel shop to determine
  who is correct about the pricing for 13 bagels. </p>

<p>Screen 2 - Using the given table, Hannah's price is validated as the best price. Explain why the store worker thinks
  the total for 13 bagels should cost $16.25.</p>
<p>Use the sentence stem: <em>The store worker thinks the price for 13 bagels should be $16.25 because …</em></p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>The store worker thinks the price for 13 bagels should be $16.25 because she multiplied 13
  times 1.25. She charged the customer for each bagel individually. </p>
<p>Screen 3 - Using the given table, Hannah's price is validated as the best price. Explain why Jaime thinks the total
  for 13 bagels should cost $13.25.</p>
<p>Use the sentence stem: <em>Jaime thinks the price for 13 bagels should be $13.25 because …</em></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Jaime thinks the price for 13 bagels should be $13.25 because that is the cost of buying two
  sets of six bagels and then one more bagel.</p>
<p>Screen 4 - Using the given table, Hannah's price is validated as the best price. Explain why Pedro thinks the total
  for 13 bagels should cost $13.00.</p>
<p>Use the sentence stem: <em>Pedro thinks the price for 13 bagels should be $13.00 because …</em></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Pedro thinks the price for 13 bagels should be $13.00 because he added the costs of buying
  10 bagels and then 3 more bagels. </p>
<p>Screen 5, Question 1 - Pretend you are the owner of the bagel shop. Explain why you would create a price list like
  this.</p>
<p>Use the sentence stem: <em>A price list like this benefits the owner because ...</em></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here are some samples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A price list like this benefits the owner because it encourages customers to buy more bagels since they will think
    they may be getting a better deal. </li>
  <li>A price list like this benefits the owner because it rewards customers who buy larger quantities with cheaper
    prices. </li>
</ul>
<p>Screen 5, Question 2 - Pretend you are the customer who is buying the 13 bagels. Explain if you like for items to be
  priced like this and why.</p>
<p>Use one of the sentence stems: <em>I do not like price lists like this because …</em> OR <em>I do not mind price
    lists like this because ...</em> </p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Your answer may vary, but here are some sample examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I do not like price lists like this because it would be easy to be overcharged for my purchases. </li>
  <li>I do not mind price lists like this because I can get a better deal for 12 bagels compared to buying them at the
    individual price. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>

  prices for 6 or more bagels), as well as the table showing the best price for each number of bagels bought.</p>

<p>Ask students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;&rsquo;Number of bagels&rsquo; and &lsquo;price&rsquo; do not form a function, but &lsquo;number of
    bagels&rsquo; and &lsquo;best price&rsquo; do form a function. Why is this? What do you recall about
    functions?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&rdquo;If we graph the relationship between &lsquo;number of bagels&rsquo; and &lsquo;price,&rsquo; what do you
    think the graph would look like?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&rdquo;If we graph the relationship between &lsquo;number of bagels&rsquo; and &lsquo;best price,&rsquo; what
    would the graph look like?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>After students make some predictions, display the two graphs for all to see. In the first graph, solid blue dots
  represent the shopkeeper&rsquo;s price, open green circles Jaime&rsquo;s price, red squares Pedro&rsquo;s price, and
  yellow triangles Hannah&rsquo;s price. In the second graph, each X represents the best price for each number of
  bagels.</p>

<p>Because there are multiple possible prices when the number of bagels is 6 or greater, price is not a function of the
  number of bagels bought.</p>
<p><img alt="Discrete function graph. number of bagels and best price in dollars."

<p>Because there is only one best price for a particular number of bagels, the best price is a function of the number of
  bagels bought.</p>
<p>Emphasize that a function assigns one output to each input. Clarify that the word &ldquo;function&rdquo; in
  mathematics has a very specific meaning that does not necessarily agree with how &ldquo;function&rdquo; is used in
  everyday life (for instance, as in the sentence &ldquo;The function of a bridge is to connect two sides of a
  river&rdquo;).</p>
