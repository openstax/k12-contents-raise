<h4>Vertical Shifts and \(y\)-Intercepts</h4>
<p>In the equation \(f(x)=mx+b\):</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(b\) is the \(y\)-intercept of the graph and indicates the point \((0,b)\) at which the graph crosses the \(y\)-axis.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>\(m\) is the slope of the line and indicates the vertical displacement (rise) and horizontal displacement (run) between each successive pair of points.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="This graph shows how to calculate the rise over run for the slope on an x, y coordinate plane.  The x-axis runs from negative 2 to 7. The y-axis runs from negative 2 to 5. The line extends right and upward from point (0,1), which is the \(y\)-intercepts.  A dotted line extends two units to the right from point (0, 1) and is labeled Run = 2.  The same dotted line extends upwards one unit and is labeled Rise =1." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/fa8d440278a4d73105cd08756daceb00bac43939"></p>
<p>The \(y\)-intercept tells where the parent function, \(f(x)=x\), has shifted up or down.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Tell how \(f(x)=x+7\) has shifted from the parent function \(f(x)=x\).<br>
  <strong>Solution:</strong> Since \(b=7\), the \(y\)-intercept is +7, so the graph shifts up 7 from the parent function.</p>
<p> <strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Tell how \(f(x)=x-9\) has shifted from the parent function \(f(x)=x\).<br>
  <strong>Solution:</strong> Since \(b=-9\), the \(y\)-intercept is &ndash;9, so the graph shifts down 9 from the parent function.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>
<p>
  Tell how \(f(x) = 2x + 1\) has shifted from \(f(x) = 2x + 5\).<br>
 <strong> Solution:</strong> Since \(b = 1\), the \(y\)-intercept is 1. This point is 4 vertical units below the \(y\)-intercepts of the original line that had a \(y\)-intercept of 5. So, the graph shifts down 4 units from \(f(x) = 2x + 5\) to arrive at \(f(x) = 2x +1\).

  <h5>Vertical Shift of a Function</h5>
  <p>A vertical shift &ldquo;transforms&rdquo; the parent function into another function by moving the graph up or down \(d\) units. </p>
  <p align="center">Vertical Shift &rarr; \(f(x) + d\)</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>If the \(d\) value is positive, the graph of the function shifts up. If the \(d\) value is negative, the graph of the function shifts down. </p>
