<h4>Vertical Shifts and \(y\)-Intercepts</h4>
<p>In the equation \(f(x)=mx+b\):</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(b\) is the \(y\)-intercept of the graph and indicates the point \((0,b)\) at which the graph crosses the \(y\)-axis.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>\(m\) is the slope of the line and indicates the vertical displacement (rise) and horizontal displacement (run) between each successive pair of points.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="This graph shows how to calculate the rise over run for the slope on an x, y coordinate plane.  The x-axis runs from negative 2 to 7. The y-axis runs from negative 2 to 5. The line extends right and upward from point (0,1), which is the y-intercept.  A dotted line extends two units to the right from point (0, 1) and is labeled Run = 2.  The same dotted line extends upwards one unit and is labeled Rise =1." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/fa8d440278a4d73105cd08756daceb00bac43939"></p>
<p>The \(y\)-intercept tells where the parent function, \(f(x)=x\), has shifted up or down.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Tell how \(f(x)=x+7\) has shifted from the parent function \(f(x)=x\).<br>
  Since \(b=7\), the \(y\)-intercept is +7, so the graph shifts up 7 from the parent function.</p>
<p>
  Example 2:</p>
<p>Tell how \(f(x)=x-9\) has shifted from the parent function \(f(x)=x\).<br>
  Since \(b=-9\), the \(y\)-intercept is &ndash;9, so the graph shifts down 9 from the parent function.</p>

  <p>Here is how to find the shift made to \(f(x)=x\):</p>
  <p>Since the \(b\) of slope-intercept form is &ndash;4, this is also the \(y\)-intercept. Therefore, the graph of \(f(x)=x\) is shifted down 4 to arrive at \(f(x)=x-4\).</p>
