<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>Students may intuitively think of graphing the function for Performance A, comparing the two graphs, and seeing which one has a greater \(y\)-value at its vertex. While this strategy is both effective and efficient, the task asks students to decide which function has a greater maximum without graphing in order to encourage them to reason algebraically.</p>
<p>Monitor for students taking different approaches. Some possible strategies:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Use the factored form of the expression for Performance A to find the \(x\)-intercepts. Then, find the midpoint of the two intercepts, identify its \(x\)-value, evaluate the expression at that value, and compare the output with the \(y\)-value of the vertex of the other graph. </li>
  <li> Convert the expression representing Performance A to vertex form, identify the vertex, and compare the \(y\)-value to that of the vertex on the graph for Performance B. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Give students time to read the task statement and think quietly about how they would go about comparing the two functions. Then, ask them to share their thoughts with their partner before beginning to work on the problem.</p>

      <p>Use this routine to support reading comprehension, without solving, for students. Use the first read to orient students to the situation. Ask students to describe what the situation is about without using numbers (two performances occurred and generated revenue). Use the second read to identify quantities and relationships. Ask students what can be counted or measured without focusing on the values. Listen for, and amplify, the important quantities that vary in relation to each other in this situation: ticket price and revenue. After the third read, ask students to brainstorm possible strategies to answer the question, &ldquo;Without creating a graph to represent the revenue from Performance A, determine which performance has the greater maximum revenue. Explain or show your reasoning.&rdquo; This helps students connect the language in the word problem and the reasoning needed to solve the problem while keeping the cognitive demand of the task.</p>

      To support development of organizational skills, check in with students within the first two to three minutes of work time. Look for students who are working to identify the zeros or convert the equation for Performance A into vertex form. If students are stuck, remind them of previous experiences converting expressions into vertex form, and encourage them to write the vertex of Performance B next to the graph to compare. If a display was created in the previous lesson, use the display as a reference. </p>

<h4>Student Activity&nbsp;</h4>
<p>A function \(A\), defined by \(p(600&minus;75p)\), describes the revenue collected from the sales of tickets for Performance A, a musical.</p>
<p>The graph represents a function \(B\) that models the revenue collected from the sales of tickets for Performance B, a Shakespearean comedy.</p>
<p><img height="215" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/d22a090d7b9a433cd29e770cec9c4f4058d70e5b" width="331"></p>
<p>In both functions, \(p\) represents the price of one ticket, and both revenues and prices are measured in dollars.</p>
<p>Without creating a graph of \(A\), determine which performance gives the greater maximum revenue when tickets are \(p\) dollars each. Explain or show your reasoning.</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Performance A.&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> The maximum revenue for Performance B is $900 based on the vertex (of a graph) of its graph. For Performance A, the expression \(p(600&minus;75p)\) is in factored form, which tells us that the horizontal intercepts are \((0,0)\) and \((8,0)\). The horizontal coordinate of the vertex is halfway between 0 and 8, which is 4. Substituting 4 for \(p\) in \(p(600&minus;75p)\) gives 1200, so the vertex is at \((4,1200)\). 1200 is greater than 900. </li>
  <li> The maximum revenue for Performance B is $900 based on the vertex of its graph. The expression \(p(600&minus;75p)\) can be rewritten in vertex form (of a quadratic expression): \(-75(p&minus;4)^2+1200\), which tells us that the vertex of a graph of the function is at \((4,1200)\) and that the maximum revenue is $1200. </li>

<h4>Finding Maximum Revenue</h4>
<p>The revenue brought in by a newspaper is modeled by \(R=p(-2500p+159,000)\). Find the maximum revenue where \(R\) is revenue and \(p\) is price per newspaper subscription.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Find the horizontal intercepts (where \(p=0\)). </li>
</ol>
<p>This occurs at \(p=0\) or \((0, 0)\).</p>
<p>\(-2500p+159,000=0\)</p>
<p>\(p=63.6\)</p>
<p>The vertex (of a graph) will occur halfway between \(p=0\) and \(p=63.6\).</p>
<p>This occurs when \(p=31.8\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li> Write in standard form and substitute \(p=31.8\). </li>

<h4>Try It: Finding Maximum Revenue</h4>
<p>Suppose that the price per unit in dollars of a cell phone production is modeled by \(p=$45-0.0125x\), where \(x\) is in thousands of phones produced, and the revenue represented by thousands of dollars is \(R=x \cdot p\). Find the production level that will maximize revenue and the maximum revenue. </p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution </strong>button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to find the maximum revenue:</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Find the horizontal intercepts.<br>
  \(x=0\) and<br>
  \(p=45-0.0125x\)<br>
  \(x=3600\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Find the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex halfway through the horizontal intercepts.<br>
  This is the number of phones produced for the maximum revenue.<br>
  \(x=1800\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Find the equation for \(R\) and substitute \(x=1800\) to find the maximum revenue.<br>
  \(R=-0.0125x^2+45x\)<br>
  \(R=-0.0125(1800)^2+45(1800))\)<br>
  \(R=$40,500\)</p>
