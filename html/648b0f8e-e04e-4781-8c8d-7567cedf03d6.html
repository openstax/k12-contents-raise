<p>In this lesson, you will apply your understanding of average rate of change to interpret or create graphs of functions that are less well defined and that model real-life situations that are more complex.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain the average rate of change of a function in terms of a situation.</li>
<li>Describe important features of a graph and explain what they mean in a situation.</li>
<li>Sketch a graph that shows important features of the situation, given a description or a visual representation of a situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities </strong>that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>4.8.1: Analyzing and Comparing the Properties of Graphs</li>
<li>4.8.2: Interpreting Graphs Without Units</li>
<li>4.8.2: Self Check</li>
<li>4.8.3: Sketching Graphs of Functions</li>
<li>4.8.3: Self Check</li>
<li>4.8.4: Using Verbal Descriptions to Create Graphs of Functions</li>
<li>4.8.5: Representing Quantities in a Situation</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>
