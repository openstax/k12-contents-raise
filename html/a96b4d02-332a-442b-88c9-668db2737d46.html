<p dir="ltr">In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Describe the &ldquo;goodness of fit&rdquo; of a linear model using the correlation coefficient.</li>
  <li>Match the correlation coefficient with a scatter plot and linear model.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>3.4.1: Comparing Scatter Plots with Linear and Nonlinear Trends<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you compared four scatter plots displaying data with linear and nonlinear trends. During this activity, you had an opportunity to use language precisely and to hear how you use terminology and talk about characteristics of items in comparison to one another.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>3.4.2: Recognizing Differences in Scatter Plots<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you were given cards displaying scatter plots of data that could be fit by linear models with varying accuracy. As you worked, you began to recognize differences in scatter plots, lines of best fit, and \(r\)-values, and the connection to the correlation coefficient.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>3.4.2: Self Check</li>
  <li>3.4.3: Matching Correlation Coefficients<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you gained a better understanding of correlation coefficients by taking turns with a partner to match scatter plots and correlation coefficients. You had a chance to explain your thinking and critique the reasoning of others.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>3.4.3: Self Check</li>
  <li>3.4.4: Using Correlation Coefficient to Determine Best Fit<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you determined the information a correlation coefficient tells you about the data in a scatter plot.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">After these activities, you completed the following<strong> practice</strong>:</p>
