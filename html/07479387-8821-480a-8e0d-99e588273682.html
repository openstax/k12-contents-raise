<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p><span>Kiran is spending $12 on games and rides at another carnival, where a game costs $0.25 and a ride costs $1.<br/></span></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>Write an equation to represent the relationship between the dollar amount Kiran is spending and the number of games, <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span>, and the number of rides, <span class="math math-repaired">\( y \)</span>, he could do.
          </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>\(0.25x + y = 12\)</p>

<li>Which graph represents the relationship between the quantities in this situation?

<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Graph C (for \(y = 12 - 14x\))</p>

<li>
            Explain how you know.
          </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p>Compare your answer: Your answer may vary, but here are some samples:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Kiran plays 0 games, he could get on 12 rides. If he gets on 0 rides, he could play 48 games. Both the points (0,12) and (48,0) are on the line in Graph C.</li>
<li> Rearranging the equation into slope-intercept form gives \(y=12−\frac{1}{4}x\), so the graph has a slope of \(-\frac{1}{4}\) and intersects the \(y\)-axis at 12, which matches Graph C.</li>

<div class="body">Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.<br/><br/></div>
