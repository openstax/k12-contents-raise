  <p>One of the most powerful tools you can give a farmer to help improve their crop is statistics. Statistics can help farmers at every stage. For example, seeds are expensive, and if you plant too many strawberries in a market where there are hundreds of strawberry farmers, you might not sell enough to make a profit. With statistical models, farmers can use demand to precisely calculate the proper amount of crops to plant.</p>
