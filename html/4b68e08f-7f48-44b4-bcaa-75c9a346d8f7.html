<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>The work in this lesson builds on the idea that both graphing and rewriting quadratic equations in the form of <em>expression</em> = 0 are useful strategies for solving equations. It also reinforces the ties between the zeros of a function and the horizontal intercepts of its graph, which students began exploring in an earlier unit.</p>
<p>Previously, to solve an equation such as \(-16t^2+8t+10=32\) by graphing, students would graph \(y=-16t^2+8t+10\) and \(y=32\) and inspect where the parabolic graph and the horizontal line intersect.</p>
<p>Here, students learn another way to use graphs to solve equations and to anticipate the number of solutions. Instead of graphing two separate equations&mdash;one quadratic and one linear&mdash;students learn that they can solve by rearranging the equation into the form <em>expression</em> \(= 0\), graphing the equation \(y =\) <em>expression</em>, and finding the horizontal intercepts. Why does this make sense?</p>
<p>The \(x\)-coordinate of those intercepts produces a \(y\)-coordinate of 0, so they are the solutions to the equation <em>expression</em> \(= 0\).</p>
<p>The number of horizontal intercepts tells us the instances when the \(y\)-coordinate is 0, which tells us the number of solutions to the equation.</p>
<p>Later in the lesson, students think about why a quadratic equation that has an expression in factored form on one side of the equal sign but does not have 0 on the other side cannot be solved the same way as when the equation is <em>expression</em>\(= 0\). They also notice that dividing each side of a quadratic equation by a variable is not reliable because it eliminates one of the solutions.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Coordinate (orally) graphs with no horizontal intercepts, quadratic functions with no (real) zeros, and quadratic equations with no (real) solutions. </li>
  <li> Describe (orally and in writing) the relationship between the solutions to quadratic equations of the form <em>expression</em> \(= 0\) and the horizontal intercepts of the graph of the related function. </li>
  <li> Explain (orally and in writing) why dividing each side of a quadratic equation by a variable is not a reliable way to solve the equation. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Explain why dividing by a variable to solve a quadratic equation is not a good strategy. </li>
  <li> Explain why quadratic equations can have no solutions and explain why there are none. </li>
</ul>
