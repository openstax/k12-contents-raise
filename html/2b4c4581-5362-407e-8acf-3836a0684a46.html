<h3>Cool-Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<p>Here is an equation:&nbsp;\( 5x&minus;2y=10 \).</p>
<p>Create a second equation that would make a system of equations with:</p>
<p>1.One solution</p>
<p>2.No solutions</p>
<p>3.Infinitely many solutions</p>

<h4>Student Response</h4>
<p><span><br>1.&nbsp;\( 3𝑥 - 𝑦 =7 \)</span><br></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;\( 5𝑥 - 2𝑦 = 20 \)</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;\( 15𝑥 - 6𝑦 = 30 \)</p>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>In Activity 2.13.4 and Activity 2.14.1 (graph B), systems of inequalities with no solutions are shown, and these will provide another opportunity to discuss when a system has no solutions and how to tell.</p>
