<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here is an equation: \( 5x-2y=10 \).</p>
<p>Create a second equation that would make a system of equations with:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li>One solution</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Compare Your Answer.  Your answer may vary, but here are some samples.  </p>
<p>\(3x - y = 7\)<br>
\(2x - 5y = 10\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>No solutions</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(5x−2y=20 \)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
    <li>Infinitely many solutions</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( 15x−6y=30\)</p>

<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>In Activity 2.13.4 and Activity 2.14.1 (graph B), systems of inequalities with no solutions are shown, and these will provide another opportunity to discuss when a system has no solutions and how to tell.</p>
