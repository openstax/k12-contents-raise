<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students encounter quadratic expressions in factored form, where at least one of the factors is a
  difference. Monitor for students who</p>
<ul>
  <li> find it useful to reason with a diagram, such as a rectangular diagram</li>
  <li> transfer what they learned when multiplying two sums in the preceding lesson&mdash;that \((x+p)(x+q)\) is
    equivalent to \(x^2+(p+q)x+pq\)<strong>&mdash;</strong>and use negative numbers for \(p\) and \(q\) </li>
</ul>
<p>Either approach is welcome, but it is important to transition students from using rectangular diagrams as a way to
  organize the terms of the factors to directly applying the distributive property to multiply binomials.</p>
<p>Students see that \((x-1)(x-1)\) can be expressed as \((x+-1)(x+-1)\), so the sides of the diagram can be labeled
  accordingly. The negative values in the expressions are not problematic when the expressions do not represent side
  lengths of a rectangle and the partial products don&rsquo;t represent areas.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Remind students we have used area diagrams to expand expressions such as \(x(x+5)\) and write equivalent expressions.
  When dealing with negative numbers, however, thinking in terms of finding area isn&rsquo;t very helpful. Explain that
  we can still draw rectangular diagrams, but use them to organize the two factors and the results of applying the
  distributive property. Note that in Unit 6, students learned how to multiply binomial expressions and square a
  binomial. They may choose to show that expressions are equivalent algebraically, through strategies like FOIL, rather
  than by drawing a diagram.</p>
<p>For example, this diagram shows that \(x(x+5)=x^2+5x\)</p>
<br>
<table class="os-raise-doubleheadertable">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col"></th>
      <th scope="col">\(x\)</th>
      <th scope="col">\(5\)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">\(x\)</th>
      <td>\(x^2\)</td>
      <td>\(5x\)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<p>Explain that such diagrams can be used even when subtraction is involved. To represent \(x(x-5)\), we can rewrite it
  as \(x(x+-5)\) then label the diagram as follows:</p>
<br>
<table class="os-raise-doubleheadertable">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col"></th>
      <th scope="col">\(x\)</th>
      <th scope="col">\(-5\)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">\(x\)</th>
      <td>\(x^2\)</td>
      <td>\(-5x\)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<p>The diagram shows that \(x(x-5)=x(x+-5)=x^2+-5x=x^2-5x\)</p>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Give students a moment of quiet time to think about the first question, and then
  ask them to discuss their response with a partner before continuing to the second question.</p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students will write the expression in the last question as \(x^2-2^2\). Remind them that just as \(x^2\) means
  \(x \cdot x\), the expression \((x-2)^2\) means \((x-2)(x-2)\).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Select students with contrasting strategies to share their work. Display those that used a diagram first and make
    connections to those that did not use a diagram. </li>
  <li> Emphasize that we can view \(x-1\) as \(x+-1\), and the expression \((x-1)(x-1)\) as two sums: \((x+-1)(x+-1)\).
    Likewise, the expression \((x+3)(x-2)\) can be viewed as two sums: \((x+3)(x+-2)\). We can then draw diagrams (as
    shown in the Answers) to organize the terms of the factors. We can also apply the distributive property and
    distribute the multiplication of each term in one factor to each term in the other factor. Display and explain the
    following reasoning to students: </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt='Equivalent expressions by using the Distributive Property." class="h-max-height--15-lines" height="530' height="200" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/f6c930f215779b5fa49723ccfc6080054529290c" width="200"></p>
<p>Time permitting, consider helping students to generalize their work. Remind them that, in an earlier lesson, we saw
  that a quadratic expression of the form \((x+p)(x+q)\) is equivalent to: \(x^2+px+qx+pq\) or \(x^2+(p+q)x+pq\).</p>
<p>Ask students:</p>
<ul>
  <li> &ldquo;Is the expanded expression still equivalent to the factored expression when \(p\) or \(q\) is negative?
    (Yes, because we can rewrite \((x-p)\) or \((x-q)\) as a sum.) Can you use the examples from the activity to show
    that it still is or is not?&rdquo; </li>
  <li> &ldquo;What about when both \(p\) and \(q\) are negative? (Yes. Both differences can be rewritten as a sum.) Can
    you use the examples from the activity to support your answer?&rdquo; </li>
</ul>

<h4>Multiplying Binomials with Negative Numbers</h4>
<p>In a previous lesson, you learned how to square a binomial.</p>
<p>\((a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2\) and \((a-b)^2=a^2-2ab+b^2\)</p>
<p>You can use this to solve the following example.</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 1</p>
<p>Find the expression equivalent to \((x-3)^2\).</p>
<p>This means to multiply \((x-3)\) by \((x-3)\). So, \((x-3)^2=(x-3)(x-3)\).</p>
<p>Now, distribute. Remember, you can use FOIL.</p>
<p><img alt="DIAGRAM SHOWING X MINUS 3 MULTIPLIED BY X MINUS 3. ON THE TOP, IN RED, AN ARROW IS GOING FROM X TO X. ANOTHER ARROW IS GOING FROM X TO NEGATIVE 3.

<p>Distribute the \(x\) to the second binomial, then distribute the \(&ndash; 3\) to the second binomial.</p>
<p>Then, combine like terms.</p>
<p>The expression becomes \(x^2-3x-3x+9=x^2-6x+9\).</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 2</p>
<p>Find the expression equivalent to \((x-4)(x+2)\). </p>

<p>Multiply the \(x\) by \((x+2)\), then multiply the \(&ndash; 4\) by \((x+2)\) and combine like terms:</p>
<p>\(x^2+2x-4x-8=x^2-2x+8\).</p>
<h4>Try It: Multiplying Binomials with Negative Numbers</h4>
<p>Find the expression equivalent to \((x+5)(x-3)\).</p>

<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to find an equivalent expression:</p>
<p>Distribute the \(x\) to \((x-3)\), and then distribute the \(5\) to \((x-3)\). Remember, you can use FOIL.</p>
<p>\(x^2-3x+5x-15\)</p>
<p>Next, combine like terms.</p>
