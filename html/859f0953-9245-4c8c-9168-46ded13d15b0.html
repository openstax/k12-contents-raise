<h3>Activity (30 minutes)</h3>
<p>This is the first Info Gap activity in the course. See the launch for extended instructions for facilitating this activity successfully.</p>
<p>This Info Gap activity gives students an opportunity to determine and request the information needed to represent sequences in different ways.</p>
<p>The Info Gap structure requires students to make sense of problems by determining what information is necessary, and then to ask for information they need to solve it. This may take several rounds of discussion if their first requests do not yield the information they need (MP1). It also allows them to refine the language they use and ask increasingly more precise questions until they get the information they need.</p>
<p>Three pairs of cards are provided for this Info Gap, with the expectation that one pair will be used for a class demonstration of how the Info Gap routine works.</p>
<p>Here is the text of the cards for reference and planning:</p>

<h4> Launch</h4>
<p>Tell students they will represent sequences in different ways.</p>
<p>This is the first time students do the Information Gap cards instructional routine, so it is important to demonstrate the routine in a whole-class discussion before they do the routine with each other. For this Info Gap, three sets of cards are provided so that you can demonstrate with one set, leaving two remaining sets so that each student has a chance to work with both the problem card and the data card.</p>
<p>Explain the Info Gap routine: Students work with a partner. One partner gets a problem card with a math question that doesn&rsquo;t have enough given information, and the other partner gets a data card with information relevant to the problem card. Students ask each other questions like &ldquo;What information do you need?&rdquo; and are expected to explain what they will do with the information. Once the partner with the problem card has enough information to solve the problem, both partners can look at the problem card and solve the problem independently. This graphic illustrates a framework for the routine:</p>
<p><img height="567" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/475a45a090288f5d7274651181b6d00442aa7194" width="624"></p>
<p>Display Problem Card 1 for all to see. Tell students that, as a class, they are playing the role of the person with the problem card while you play the role of the person with the data card. Explain to students that it is the job of the person with the problem card (in this case, the whole class) to think about what information they need to answer the question.</p>
<p>Explain that you will be playing the role of the person with the data card. Ask students, &ldquo;What specific information do you need to represent the first five terms of the sequence?&rdquo; Select students to ask their questions. Respond to each question with, &ldquo;Why do you need that information?&rdquo; Once students provide a mathematically valid reason, provide only data that appear on the data card. Once the class has created the representations asked for on the problem card, also display the data card so that students can see what it looks like. Reiterate that the person with the data card should only provide information that appears on their card, and only after the person with the problem card explains why they need the information.</p>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. In each group, distribute a problem card to one student and a data card to the other student. After you review their work on the first problem, give them the cards for a second problem and instruct them to switch roles. Provide access to graph paper.</p>

<div>
<p>Display questions or question starters for students who need a starting point, such as: &ldquo;Can you tell me . . . (specific piece of information),&rdquo; and &rdquo;Why do you need to know . . . (that piece of information)?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<br>
<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>

<h4>Student-Facing Statement </h4>
<p>Your teacher will give you either a problem card or a data card. Do not show or read your card to your partner.</p>
<p>If your teacher gives you the data card:</p>
<ol>
<li>
    Silently read the information on your card.
  </li>
<li>
    Ask your partner, &ldquo;What specific information do you need?&rdquo; and wait for your partner to ask for information. Only give information that is on your card. (Do not figure out anything for your partner!)
  </li>
<li>
    Before telling your partner the information, ask, &ldquo;Why do you need to know (that piece of information)?&rdquo;</li>
<li>
    Read the problem card and solve the problem independently.
  </li>
<li>
    Share the data card and discuss your reasoning.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>If your teacher gives you the problem card:</p>
<ol>
<li>
    Silently read your card and think about what information you need to answer the question.
  </li>
<li>
    Ask your partner for the specific information that you need.
  </li>
<li>
    Explain to your partner how you are using the information to solve the problem.
  </li>
<li>
    When you have enough information, share the problem card with your partner and solve the problem independently.
  </li>
<li>
    Read the data card and discuss your reasoning.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Make a visual pattern (for example, using dots or boxes), starting with Step 0, so the pattern for Step \(n\) contains \(n^2+3n+3\) dots.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>After students have completed their work, share the correct answers and ask students to discuss the process of representing the sequences in different ways. Display the cards for all to see throughout the discussion. Some students may be surprised to see the different structures of the cards even though they were about the same topic. Allow time for students to share what questions they found helpful for solving their problem card and how they came up with them.</p>
<p>Highlight connections between the representations. For example, a recursive definition might include \(f(1)=16\), which corresponds to an entry in a table and the point \((1,16)\) on a graph.</p>

<h4>Representing Sequences</h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some more examples for finding the recursive definition of arithmetic and geometric sequences ways to represent them.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>An arithmetic sequence, \(a\), begins 11, 7, . . .</p>
<ol>
<li>
    Write a recursive definition for this sequence using function notation.
  </li>
<li>
    Sketch a graph of the first 5 terms of this sequence.
  </li>
<li>
    Explain how to use the recursive definition to find \(a(100)\). (Don&rsquo;t actually determine the value.)
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
    \(a(1)=11, a(n)=a(n-1)-4, n\geq2\)

<ol start="3">
<li>
    Starting with 11, keep subtracting 4 until you do that 99 times.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Example 2:&nbsp;</p>
<p>A geometric sequence, \(g\), starts 80, 40, . . .</p>
<ol>
<li>
    Write a recursive definition for this sequence using function notation.
  </li>
<li>
    Use your definition to make a table of values for \(g(n)\) for the first 6 terms.
  </li>
<li>
    Explain how to use the recursive definition to find \(g(100)\). (Don&rsquo;t actually determine the value.)
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
    \(g(1)=80, g(n)= \frac12 \cdot g(n-1), n\geq2\)

<h4>Try It: Representing Sequences</h4>
<p>Write a recursive definition for \(P(n)\), the sequence below:</p>
<p>1, 2, 4, 8, 16</p>
<p>Write down your answer. Then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to check your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to write the recursive definition for \(P(n)\):</p>
<p>First: \(P(1)=1\), then each term is 2 times the previous term, so \(P(n)=2P(n-1), n\geq2\)</p>
