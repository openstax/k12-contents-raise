      <h2>Activity (15 minutes)</h2>
      <div class="body">
        <div>
          <p>So far, students have seen only one-variable equations that have a solution. For these equations, performing acceptable moves always led to equivalent equations that have the same solution. In this activity, students encounter an example where the given equation has no solutions and performing the familiar moves leads to an untrue statement.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Prior to this point, students have added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided a number from both sides of an equation. They have also added a variable expression to (or subtracted a variable expression from) an equation. They recognize these moves as allowable for solving equations. Here, students also come across an equation that is divided by a variable expression and make sense of why it leads to a false statement.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Launch</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>Arrange students into groups of 3&ndash;4. Give groups 1&ndash;2 minutes of quiet time to analyze the first set of equations and then time to brainstorm why Noah&rsquo;s work results in a false statement. Follow with a class discussion.</p>
        <p>Invite students to share their explanations as to why Noah ended up with <span class="math math-repaired">\( 6=1 \)</span>. Students are likely to say that the moves Noah made were allowable and can be explained, but they may struggle to say why they end up with a false statement.</p>
        <p>Draw students&rsquo; attention to the third line of Noah&rsquo;s work. Ask them to interpret the expression on each side of the equal sign: <span class="math math-repaired">\( x + 6 \)</span> can be interpreted as 6 more than a number and <span class="math math-repaired">\( x + 1 \)</span> as 1 more than that same number. Then, ask them to try to find a value of <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span> that could make that equation true. (There isn&rsquo;t one!)</p>
        <p>Highlight that it&rsquo;s not possible for 6 more than some number, no matter what that number is, to be equal to 1 more than that number. If no value of <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span> could make the third equation true, the same could be said about the original equation&mdash;it has no solution. So even though Noah performed acceptable moves, the final equation is a false equation. Because all of these equations are equivalent, this means the original equation is also a false equation. It has no solutions because no value of <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span> could make the equation true.</p>
        <p>Repeat the process to analyze the second set of equations. See Activity Synthesis for discussion questions.</p>

      <h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>Noah is having trouble solving two equations. In each case, he took steps that he thought were acceptable but ended up with statements that are clearly not true. </p>
        <p>Analyze Noah&rsquo;s work on each equation and the moves he made. Were they acceptable moves? Why do you think he ended up with a false equation?</p>
        <p>Discuss your observations with your group and be prepared to share your conclusions. If you get stuck, consider solving each equation.</p>

      <h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>Some students may point to a step that is valid and mistakenly identify it as an error. For instance, in the first set of steps, they may object to replacing <span class="math math-repaired">\( +1 - 3x \)</span> with <span class="math math-repaired">\( -3x+1 \)</span>, thinking that it should be rearranged to <span class="math math-repaired">\( +3x-1 \)</span>. Push their reasoning with a simpler example. Ask, for instance, if <span class="math math-repaired">\( +7 - 4 \)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math math-repaired">\( +4 - 7 \)</span>. Remind students that we can think of <span class="math math-repaired">\( +7 -4 \)</span> as <span class="math math-repaired">\( +7 + (-4) \)</span> and then apply the commutative property of addition to get <span class="math math-repaired">\( -4 + 7 \)</span>.</p>
        <p>If students hypothesize about two equations being equivalent but are not sure how to check if it&rsquo;s actually the case, suggest that a good way to check is by finding the solution to one equation, then checking whether that value is also a solution to the second equation.</p>

        <p>Invite students to share what they thought was the problem with Noah&rsquo;s work. They are likely to say that Noah seems to have performed allowable moves and did them correctly. Then, draw students&rsquo; attention to the second-to-last step: <span class="math math-repaired">\( 2x = 3x \)</span>. Ask students:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>&ldquo;Earlier, when looking at <span class="math math-repaired">\( x + 6 = x + 1 \)</span>, we reasoned that there&rsquo;s no value of <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span> that could make this equation true. Is there a value of <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span> that could make <span class="math math-repaired">\( 2x = 3x \)</span> true?&rdquo; (Yes, 0.)</li>
          <li>&ldquo;If there is a value that can make <span class="math math-repaired">\( 2x=3x \)</span> true, what do we know about the original equation? Is it also true?&rdquo; (Yes, they are all equivalent equations.) &ldquo;What is its solution?&rdquo; (0)</li>
          <li>&ldquo;So the equations are true up through the third step. The last step is where we have a false statement, after Noah shows division by <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span>. If <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span> is 0, what might be the problem with dividing by <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span>?&rdquo; (If <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span> is 0, then we are dividing both sides by 0, which gives an undefined result.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Explain that dividing by the variable in the equation is not done because if the solution happens to be 0, it could lead us to thinking that there is no solution while in fact there is (the solution is the number 0).</p>
        <p>Revisit the lists of acceptable and unacceptable moves compiled in earlier activities. Add &ldquo;dividing by the variable&rdquo; and &ldquo;dividing by 0&rdquo; to the list of unacceptable moves.</p>
