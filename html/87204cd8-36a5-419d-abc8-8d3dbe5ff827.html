<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>So far, students have seen only one-variable equations that have a solution. For these equations, performing
  acceptable moves always led to equivalent equations that have the same solution. In this activity, students encounter
  an example where the given equation has no solutions and performing the familiar moves leads to an untrue statement.
</p>
<p>Prior to this point, students have added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided a number from both sides of an
  equation. They have also added a variable expression to (or subtracted a variable expression from) an equation. They
  recognize these moves as allowable for solving equations. Here, students also come across an equation that is divided
  by a variable expression and make sense of why it leads to a false statement.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students into groups of 3&ndash;4. Give groups 1&ndash;2 minutes of quiet time to analyze the first set of
  equations and then time to brainstorm why Noah&rsquo;s work results in a false statement. Follow with a class
  discussion.</p>
<p>Invite students to share their explanations as to why Noah ended up with \( 6=1 \).
    Students are likely to say that the moves Noah made were allowable and can be explained, but they may struggle to
    say why they end up with a false statement.</p>
<p>Draw students&rsquo; attention to the third line of Noah&rsquo;s work. Ask them to interpret the expression on each
  side of the equal sign: \( x + 6 \) can be interpreted as 6 more than a number and
    \( x + 1 \) as 1 more than that same number. Then, ask them to try to find a value
      of \( x \) that could make that equation true. (There isn&rsquo;t one!)</p>
<p>Highlight that it&rsquo;s not possible for 6 more than some number, no matter what that number is, to be equal to 1
  more than that number. If no value of \( x \) could make the third equation true, the
    same could be said about the original equation&mdash;it has no solution. So even though Noah performed acceptable
    moves, the final equation is a false equation. Because all of these equations are equivalent, this means the
    original equation is also a false equation. It has no solutions because no value of 
      \( x \) could make the equation true.</p>
<p>Repeat the process to analyze the second set of equations. See Activity Synthesis for discussion questions.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Noah is having trouble solving two equations. In each case, he took steps that he thought were acceptable but ended
  up with statements that are clearly not true. </p>
<p>Analyze Noah&rsquo;s work on each equation and the moves he made. Were they acceptable moves? Why do you think he
  ended up with a false equation?</p>
<p>Discuss your observations with your group and be prepared to share your conclusions. If you get stuck, consider
  solving each equation.</p>

<p>Since there is not a variable and the statement is true, any value of \( x \) would be a solution for the original
  equation. So, this equation has infinitely many solutions.</p><br>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<p>Compare your answer:</p>
<p>Example 1: All the moves that Noah made were acceptable, but because he ended up with a false statement, that means
there is no value of \( x \) that makes the first equation true. We can see it in the
  third line: \( x+6 = x+1 \). There is no number that can make the equation true.</p>
    <p>Example 2: Noah&rsquo;s moves seem acceptable except for the last one. If he had subtracted 
      \( 2x \) from each side of the equation, he would have 
        \( 0 = x \). Instead, he divided both sides by \( x
          \), which would give an undefined number if \( x \) is 0. (See Activity
            Synthesis.)</p>

            <h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
            <p>Some students may point to a step that is valid and mistakenly identify it as an error. For instance, in
              the first set of steps, they may object to replacing \( +1 - 3x \) with
                \( -3x+1 \), thinking that it should be rearranged to \( +3x-1 \). Push their reasoning with a simpler example. Ask, for
                    instance, if \( +7 - 4 \) is equivalent to 
                        \( +4 - 7 \). Remind students that we can think of 
                          \( +7 -4 \) as \( +7 + (-4) \) and
                            then apply the commutative property of addition to get \(
                              -4 + 7 \).</p>
            <p>If students hypothesize about two equations being equivalent but are not sure how to check if it&rsquo;s
              actually the case, suggest that a good way to check is by finding the solution to one equation, then
              checking whether that value is also a solution to the second equation.</p>
            <h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
            <p>Invite students to share what they thought was the problem with Noah&rsquo;s work. They are likely to say
              that Noah seems to have performed allowable moves and did them correctly. Then, draw students&rsquo;
              attention to the second-to-last step: \( 2x = 3x \). Ask students:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>&ldquo;Earlier, when looking at \( x + 6 = x + 1 \), we reasoned that
                  there&rsquo;s no value of \( x \) that could make this equation true.
                    Is there a value of \( x \) that could make \( 2x = 3x \) true?&rdquo; (Yes, 0.)</li>
              <li>&ldquo;If there is a value that can make \( 2x=3x \) true, what do we
                  know about the original equation? Is it also true?&rdquo; (Yes, they are all equivalent equations.)
                  &ldquo;What is its solution?&rdquo; (0)</li>
              <li>&ldquo;So the equations are true up through the third step. The last step is where we have a false
                statement, after Noah shows division by \( x \). If \( x \) is 0, what might be the problem with dividing by \( x \)?&rdquo; (If \( x \) is 0, then
                        we are dividing both sides by 0, which gives an undefined result.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Explain that dividing by the variable in the equation is not done because if the solution happens to be
              0, it could lead us to thinking that there is no solution while in fact there is (the solution is the
              number 0).</p>
            <p>Revisit the lists of acceptable and unacceptable moves compiled in earlier activities. Add
              &ldquo;dividing by the variable&rdquo; and &ldquo;dividing by 0&rdquo; to the list of unacceptable moves.

                <p>The equations \(-4 = -4\), \(5 =5\), and \(0=0\) are all true statements because one side is equal to
