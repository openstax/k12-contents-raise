<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>Noah is having trouble solving two equations. In each case, he took steps that he thought were acceptable but ended
  up with statements that are clearly not true.</p>
<p>Analyze Noah&rsquo;s work on each equation and the moves he made. Were they acceptable moves? Why do you think he
  ended up with a false equation?</p>
<p>Discuss your observations with your group and be prepared to share your conclusions. If you get stuck, consider
  solving each equation.</p>
<div class="os-raise-d-flex os-raise-justify-content-between"><p><strong>Example 1</strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>Step 1 - </strong>Original equation.<br>
\( x+6 =4x+1-3x \)<br>
<br>
<strong>Step 2 - </strong>Apply the Commutative Property.<br>
\( x+6 =4x-3x+1 \)<br>
<br>
<strong>Step 3 - </strong>Combine like terms.<br>
\( x+6 =x+1 \)<br>
<br>
<strong>Step 4 - </strong>Subtract \(x\) from each side.<br>
\( 6 =1 \)</p> 
<p><strong>Example 2</strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>Step 1 - </strong>Original equation.<br>
\( 2(5+x)-1=3x+9 \)<br>
<br>
<strong>Step 2 - </strong>Apply the Distributive Property.<br>
\( 10+2x-1 =3x+9 \)<br>
<br>
<strong>Step 3 - </strong>Subtract 10 from each side.<br>
&nbsp;\( 2x-1 =3x-1 \)<br>
<br>
<strong>Step 4 - </strong>Add 1 to each side.<br>
\( 2x=3x \)<br>

    <li>Why did Noah arrive at no solution for the equation solved in Example 1? 
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
<p> Your answer may vary, but here is an example: <br>
All the moves that Noah made were acceptable, but because he ended up with a false statement, that means there is no value of \(x\) that makes the first equation true. We can see it in the third line: \(x+6=x+1\). There is no number that can make the equation true.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
    <li>Why did Noah arrive at no solution for the equation solved in Example 2?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
<p>Your answer may vary, but here is an example:<br>
Noah's moves seem acceptable except for the last one. If he had subtracted \(2x\) from each side of the equation, he would have \(0=x\). Instead, he divided both sides by \(x\) which would give an undefined number if \(x\) is 0.

<p>Analyze Noahâ€™s work on each equation and the moves he made. Were they acceptable moves? Why do you think he ended up with a false equation?
</p>
<p>Discuss your observations with your group and be prepared to share your conclusions. If you get stuck, consider solving each equation.
</p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>
<p>Noah tried to solve a third equation and ended up with a true statement, without variables.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 1 - </strong>Simplify each side of the equation as much as possible.
Use the Distributive Property to remove any parentheses.
Combine like terms.
<br>
    \( 2 (4 + x) - 2 = 2x + 6 \)<br>\(2x+6=2x+6\)
    </p>
<p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Collect all the variable terms on one side of the equation.
Use the Addition or Subtraction Property of Equality.
             Subtract \(2x\) from both sides.
<br>
\(2x-2x+6=6\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 - </strong>Collect all the constant terms on the other side of the equation.
Use the Addition or Subtraction Property of Equality.
             Subtract 6 from each side.
<br>
\(0+6-6=6-6\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 - </strong>Make the coefficient of the variable term equal to 1.
This step is not needed.
<br>
\(0=0\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 - </strong> Check the solution.<br> 
Since there is not a variable and the statement is true, any value of \(x\) would be a solution for the original equation. So, this equation has infinitely many solutions.

        <h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
            <p>Some students may point to a step that is valid and mistakenly identify it as an error. For instance, in
              the first set of steps, they may object to replacing \( +1 - 3x \) with
                \( -3x+1 \), thinking that it should be rearranged to \( +3x-1 \). Push their reasoning with a simpler example. Ask, for
                    instance, if \( +7 - 4 \) is equivalent to 
                        \( +4 - 7 \). Remind students that we can think of 
                          \( +7 -4 \) as \( +7 + (-4) \) and
                            then apply the commutative property of addition to get \(
                              -4 + 7 \).</p>
            <p>If students hypothesize about two equations being equivalent but are not sure how to check if it&rsquo;s
              actually the case, suggest that a good way to check is by finding the solution to one equation, then
              checking whether that value is also a solution to the second equation.</p>
            <h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
            <p>Invite students to share what they thought was the problem with Noah&rsquo;s work. They are likely to say
              that Noah seems to have performed allowable moves and did them correctly. Then, draw students&rsquo;
              attention to the second-to-last step: \( 2x = 3x \). Ask students:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>&ldquo;Earlier, when looking at \( x + 6 = x + 1 \), we reasoned that
                  there&rsquo;s no value of \( x \) that could make this equation true.
                    Is there a value of \( x \) that could make \( 2x = 3x \) true?&rdquo; (Yes, 0.)</li>
              <li>&ldquo;If there is a value that can make \( 2x=3x \) true, what do we
                  know about the original equation? Is it also true?&rdquo; (Yes, they are all equivalent equations.)
                  &ldquo;What is its solution?&rdquo; (0)</li>
              <li>&ldquo;So the equations are true up through the third step. The last step is where we have a false
                statement, after Noah shows division by \( x \). If \( x \) is 0, what might be the problem with dividing by \( x \)?&rdquo; (If \( x \) is 0, then
                        we are dividing both sides by 0, which gives an undefined result.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Explain that dividing by the variable in the equation is not done because if the solution happens to be
              0, it could lead us to thinking that there is no solution while in fact there is (the solution is the
              number 0).</p>
            <p>Revisit the lists of acceptable and unacceptable moves compiled in earlier activities. Add
              &ldquo;dividing by the variable&rdquo; and &ldquo;dividing by 0&rdquo; to the list of unacceptable moves.

              <h4>Equations Without Solutions&nbsp;</h4>
              <p>What happens when we solve \( 5z = 5z - 1\)?<br></p>

<p><strong>Step 1 - </strong>Collect all the variable terms on one side of the equation.<br>Subtract \(5z\) to get the \(z\) terms together on one side.</p>
<p>\(\begin{aligned}5z-5z &amp;=5z-5z-1\end{aligned}\)<br></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Simplify and the \(z\) terms are gone!.</p>
<p>\(\begin{aligned}0 &amp;=1\end{aligned}\)</p>
<p>Since 0 does not equal \(-1\), this equation led to a false statement. There are no solutions to this equation.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Solve \( 5m+3(9+3m)=2(7m&minus;11) \).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 - </strong>Simplify each side of the equation as much as possible.
Use the Distributive Property to remove any parentheses.
Combine like terms.<br>
\( 5m+27+9m=14mâˆ’22   \)<br>
\(14m+27=14mâˆ’22\)</p>

<p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Collect all the variable terms on one side of the equation.<br>
Use the Addition or Subtraction Property of Equality.<br>
    \(14mâˆ’14m+27=14mâˆ’14mâˆ’22\)<br>
\(27=-22\)
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 - </strong> Check the solution.<br>
The equation \(27=âˆ’22\) is NOT a true statement. The equation 5m+3(9+3m)=2(7mâˆ’11) has no solutions.
</p>

<h4>Infinitely Many Solutions</h4>
<p>What if an equation results in a true statement without variables?</p>
<p>The equations \( -4 = -4 \),&nbsp;\( 5 = 5 \), and&nbsp;\( 0 = 0 \) are all true statements because one side is equal to the other. This means that any value of the variable in the original equation would be a solution. When this happens in the final step of an equation, there are infinitely many solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
Solve \( 2y +6 =2(y+3) \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 - </strong>Simplify each side of the equation as much as possible.
Use the Distributive Property to remove any parentheses.
Combine like terms.
</p>
<p>\( 2y +6 =2(y+3) \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 - </strong> Collect all the variable terms on one side of the equation.
Use the Addition or Subtraction Property of Equality.<br>
   \( 2yâˆ’2y+6=2yâˆ’2y+6\)<br>
\(6=6\)

</p>
<p>\(2y+6=2y+6\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 - </strong> Check the solution.
We say the solution to the equation is all of the real numbers.An equation that is true for any value of the variable is called an <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-store="glossary-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0">identity</span>.
</p>
<p>The solution of an identity is all real numbers.</p>
<br>            
<h4>Try It: Equations with No Solutions and Infinitely Many Solutions&nbsp;</h4>

<p>1. Solve&nbsp;\( 10x - 4 = 2(5x -2) \)and determine the number of solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.</p>
  <p>Solve this linear equation using a general strategy:</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1 - </strong>Original equation.<br></p>
  <p>\( 10x - 4 = 2(5x -2) \)</p> 
  <p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Distribute<br></p>
  <p>\( 10x - 4 =10x - 4 \)</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3 - </strong>Collect all the variable terms on one side of the equation. Use the Addition or Subtraction Property of Equality. <br></p>
  <p>\(\begin{aligned}10x - 10x - 4  &amp;=10x - 10x - 4 \\-4 &amp;=-4 \end{aligned}\)<br></p>
  <p><strong>Step 4 - </strong>Check the solution.</p>
  <p>This is a true statement so there are infinitely many solutions.</p>
<br>
 <p>2. Solve&nbsp;\( 3x - 4 = 3(x -2) \)&nbsp;and determine the number of solutions.</p>
 <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
 <p> Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.</p>
  <p>Solve this linear equation using a general strategy:</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1 - </strong>Original equation.<br></p>
  <p>\( 3x - 4 = 3(x -2) \)</p> 
  <p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Distribute<br></p>
  <p>\( 3x - 4 = 3x -6 \)</p> 
  <p><strong>Step 3 - </strong>Collect all the variable terms on one side of the equation. Use the Addition or Subtraction Property of Equality. <br></p>
  <p>\(\begin{aligned}3x - 3x - 4  &amp;=3x - 3x - 6 \\-4 &amp;=-6 \end{aligned}\)<br></p>
  <p><strong>Step 4 - </strong>Check the solution</p>
  <p>The equation \( -4=-6\) is NOT a true statement. The equation \(&nbsp;( 3x - 4 = 3(x -2) \)&nbsp; has no solutions. </p>
