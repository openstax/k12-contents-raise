<li>
<p>Which equation represents the relationship between the number of games, \( x \), and the number of rides, \( y \), that Jada could do if she spends all her money?<br></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><span class="math math-repaired">\( x + y = 20 \)</span></li>
<li><span class="math math-repaired">\( 2x + y = 20 \)</span></li>
<li><span class="math math-repaired">\( x + 2y = 20 \)</span></li>
</ol>
