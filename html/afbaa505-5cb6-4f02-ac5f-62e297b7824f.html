<p>It's time to design your own trail mix!</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Choose two ingredients that you like to eat. (You can choose from the ingredients in the previous activity, or you can look up nutrition information for other ingredients.) </li>
  <li> Think about the constraints for your trail mix. What do you want to be true about its calories, protein, sugar, fat, or fiber? </li>
  <li> Write inequalities to represent your constraints. Then, graph the inequalities. <img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/04008b8056fd0131e83e7d1f4598ab1d60b92222" alt="Blank coordinate plane with grid, origin O."/></li>
  <li> Is it possible to make a trail mix that meets all your constraints using your ingredients? If not, make changes to your constraints or your ingredients and record them here. </li>
  <li> Write a possible combination of ingredients for your trail mix. </li>
</ol>
