<p>Some key takeaways from this lesson are that parts of linear functions can be used to determine how graphs of linear functions can be transformed.</p>
<p>Remind students that identifying horizontal transformations (shifts or dilations) may be difficult for students to identify for linear functions. The effects of horizontal transformations often appear to yield similar effects as vertical transformations.</p> 
<p>To help students see these points, discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Describe how a linear function, such as \(f(x)=4x-1\), can be graphed using the \(y\)-intercept and then the slope and also how it can be graphed using transformations. </li>
  <li> Do the same for \(y=-\frac14 x +3\). </li>
  <li>Describe how \(f(x+2)\) impacts the graph of \(f(x) = 4x - 1\).</li> 
  <li>Describe how f(-Â¼ x) impacts the graph of f(x) = 4x - 1. </li> 
  <li>Describe the transformations that are visible in point-slope form when compared to the parent linear function. (horizontal shift, vertical shift, vertical dilation)</li>

</ul>
<p>Tell students that expressions, equations, and inequalities are mathematical models. A model is a mathematical representation of a real-life situation. When people create models, they rely on the information they have, but they also make assumptions and decisions that affect the models. If the information or assumptions change, the model would also change.</p>
