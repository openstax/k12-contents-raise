<p>Some key takeaways from this lesson are that parts of linear functions can be used to determine how graphs of linear functions can be transformed.</p>
<p>To help students see these points, discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Describe how a linear function, such as \(f(x)=4x-1\), can be graphed using the \(y\)-intercept and then the slope and also how it can be graphed using transformations. </li>
  <li> Do the same for \(y=-\frac14 x +3\). </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell students that expressions, equations, and inequalities are mathematical models. A model is a mathematical representation of a real-life situation. When people create models, they rely on the information they have, but they also make assumptions and decisions that affect the models. If the information or assumptions change, the model would also change.</p>
