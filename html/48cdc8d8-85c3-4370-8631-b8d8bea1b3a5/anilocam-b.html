<p>In this lesson, you will write a system of equations to represent the quantities and constraints in each of several situations, find a solution that meets multiple constraints by graphing, and then interpret the solution in context.</p>

<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explain &ldquo;the solution to a system of linear equations&rdquo; and how the solution is represented graphically.</li>
  <li>Refer to two equations as a system of equations.</li>
  <li>Use tables and graphs to solve systems of equations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below are the knowledge and skills you will practice in this lesson. Before you begin, read each one and rate how much you currently know about each one. It’s okay if your ratings are low; the purpose of this is to check in with yourself about what you do or do not yet know.</p>

<p><strong>Can you...</strong></p>
