<p>In this lesson, you will write a system of equations to represent the quantities and constraints in each of several situations, find a solution that meets multiple constraints by graphing, and then interpret the solution in context.</p>
<p>Below are the knowledge and skills you will practice in this lesson. Before you begin, read each one and rate how much you currently know about each one. It&rsquo;s okay if your ratings are low; the purpose of this is to check in with yourself about what you do or do not yet know.</p>
<p><strong>Can you...</strong></p>
