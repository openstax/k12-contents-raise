<h3>Activity (10 minutes) </h3>
<p>In this activity, students continue to work with inequalities in two variables in context. They write an inequality that represents the constraints in a situation, graph its solutions, and interpret points in the solution region.</p>
<p>Earlier, students saw that some points in the solution region might satisfy an inequality (mathematically) but might not work in the given situation because other considerations were at play. Here, they see another reason that some values that satisfy an inequality might be unfeasible in the situation-namely, that the pair of values must be whole numbers.</p>
<p>As students work, look for those who plot discrete points to represent the solution region and those who shade a part of the plane.</p>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<p>Arrange (or keep) students in groups of 2. Give students a few minutes of quiet time to work on the first three questions, and then time to discuss their responses before they continue with the last two questions.</p>
<p>Emphasize that by analyzing the different combinations of necklaces and bracelets that can be made and sold, the vendor can prepare each week by making the right amount of each piece of jewelry. This information can also be used  to try to ensure that the vendor makes $100 in profit every week.</p>

<p>Students may first come up with good reasons why this can't be done (with linear inequalities). They may also respond with \( x &lt; \text{infinity} \) or something similar. Both of these tacks deserve praise, but tell students that this problem really is possible using real numbers. Students may ultimately need the hint that they will need to leave the realm of linear inequalities to answer these questions.</p>
<h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>
<p>Some students may have trouble graphing the line that delineates the solution region from non-solution region because they are used to solving for the variable \( y \), but here the variables are \( b \) and \( n \). Ask these students to decide which variable to solve for based on the graph that has been set up. Ask them to notice which quantity is represented by the vertical axis.</p>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>If some students plotted discrete points and some shaded the region, choose one of each and display these for all to see. Ask students why each one might be an appropriate representation of the solutions to the inequality.</p>
<p>Highlight that the discrete points represent the situation more accurately, because it is impossible to sell a fraction of a bracelet or 2.75 necklaces. It is, however, tedious to plot a bunch of points to show the solution region. It is much easier to shade the entire region, but with the understanding that, in this situation, only whole-number values make sense as solutions.</p>

<h4>Graph Linear Inequalities in Two Variables</h4>
<p>Now that we know what the graph of a linear inequality looks like and how it relates to a boundary equation we can use this knowledge to graph a given linear inequality.</p>
<p><strong>Example </strong><br>
  How to Graph a Linear Equation in Two Variables</p>
<p>Graph the linear inequality \( y &ge; \frac{3}{4} x &minus; 2 \).</p>
<p><b>Step 1.</b> Identify and graph the boundary line. </p>
<p>  If the inequality is \(\leq\) or &gt;\(\geq\)
  boundary line is solid. </p>
<p>If the inequality is &lt; or &gt;, the boundary
line is dashed. </p>
<p>Replace the
inequality sign with an equal sign to find the boundary line</p>
<p>\(y=\frac34x-2.\)</p>
<p>The
  inequality sign is \(\geq\), so we draw a solid line.</p>
<p><img alt class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="205" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/73a02b5f0522899713366bc7f2696871112ac313" width="200"></p>
<p><b>Step 2.</b> Test a point that is not on the boundary line. Is it a solution of the
inequality?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll test
\((0,0)\).</p>
<p>Is it a solution
  of the inequality?</p>
<p>At \((0, 0)\),
is \(y \geq \frac34x-2.\)?</p>
<p>\(0\overset?\geq\frac34(0)-2\)</p>
<p>\(0\geq-2\)</p>
<p>So, \((90,0)\)
  is a solution.</p>
<p><b>Step 3.</b> Shade in one side of the boundary line. </p>
<p>If the test point is a solution, shade in the side
  that includes the point. </p>
<p> If the test point is not a solution, shade in
  the opposite side. </p>
<p>The test
          point  \((0,0)\) is a solution to \(y\geq\frac34x-2.\)
So we shade in that side.</p>
<p><img alt class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="202" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/3fb1b437b5f627f97dd1a57c0ef8f9697fa730b6" width="200"></p>
<p>All points in
  the shaded region and on the boundary line represent the solutions to \(y\geq\frac34x-2.\)</p>

<h4>Try It: Graph Linear Inequalities in Two Variables</h4>

<li>Graph the linear inequality \(y\;&gt;\;\frac52x\;-\;4\). Use the graphing tool or technology outside the course. Graph the inequality. Students were provided access to Desmos.</li> 
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p>All points in the shaded region represent the solutions to\( y &gt; \frac{5}{2}x &minus; 4 \).</p>
