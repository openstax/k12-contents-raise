    <p>The Collegiate Review publishes information about colleges and universities. The data below are for six public 4-year colleges in New York. Graduation rate is the percentage of students who graduate within six years. Student-to-faculty ratio is the number of students per full-time faculty member.</p>

  <li>\(r \approx -0.83\)</li>
  <li>\(r \approx 0.83\)</li>
  <li>\(r \approx -0.27\)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Let \(x\) represent the number of full-time students and \(y\) represent the graduation rate. The correlation coefficient is \(r &asymp; 0.83\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>Is the linear relationship between graduation rate and number of full-time students weak, moderate, or strong? On what did you base your decision?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>weak</li>
  <li>moderate</li>
  <li>strong</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Based on the table presented in the lesson, the linear relationship between graduation rate and the number of full-time students is strong. </p>
