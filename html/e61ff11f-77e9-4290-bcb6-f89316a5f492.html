<p>In this lesson, you will work on activities that focus on the coefficient of the linear term, the \(b\) in \(ax^2+bx+c\), and how changes to it affect the graph. You will discover that adding a linear term to the squared term translates the graph in both horizontal and vertical directions. This understanding will show that writing an expression such as \(x^2+b\) in factored form can help us reason how to sketch the graph.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Explain how the \(b\) in \(ax^2+bx+c\) affects the graph of the equation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Match equations given in standard and factored form with their graph.
  </li>
</ul>
