Lesson Narrative

This lesson focuses on the many ways that students will use information to write linear equations. Students will review writing linear equations given two points, a slope and a point, and the slope and \(y\)-intercept. Students will also become more comfortable using the point-slope form and slope-intercept form. Additionally, students will focus more on creating a table of values from a verbal description as well as using a table of values to then write a linear equation.

Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)

Students will be able to:

Write linear equations given two points or a slope and point. 

Make a table of values to represent a verbal description. 

Write an equation from a table of values. 



Learning Targets (Student Facing)

Write equations from a point and slope. 

Write equations from two points. 

Write equations from a verbal description.

Support for English Language Learners

Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.

(2A) distinguish sounds and intonation patterns of English with increasing ease 

(2B) recognize elements of the English sound system in newly acquired vocabulary such as long and short vowels, silent letters, and consonant clusters 

(3A) practice producing sounds of newly acquired vocabulary such as long and short vowels, silent letters, and consonant clusters to pronounce English words in a manner that is increasingly comprehensible 

(4A) learn relationships between sounds and letters of the English language and decode (sound out) words using a combination of skills such as recognizing sound-letter relationships and identifying cognates, affixes, roots, and base words 

(5A) learn relationships between sounds and letters of the English language to represent sounds when writing in English 



Support for Building Character

Throughout this unit, find ways to encourage and support students to work on cultivating their social intelligence.

Here are some tips to try during this lesson:

Alter Ego 

Longing to Belong
