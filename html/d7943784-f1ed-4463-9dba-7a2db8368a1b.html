<h3>Optional Activity (25 minutes)</h3>
<p>The activities in this lesson are an extension of the TEKS expectations.</p>
<p>This activity allows students to investigate another way (beside guessing and checking) for finding the factors of quadratic expressions in standard form where the leading coefficient is not 1. The method involves temporarily substituting the squared term with another variable so that the leading coefficient is 1 (which makes it easier to spot the factors of the expression), and then substituting the original variable back once the expression is in factored form.</p>
<p>Students may find the reasoning and substitution processes challenging. Transitioning from, for example, \(9x^2 + 21x + 10\) to \((3x)^2+ 7(3x) + 10\), and then to \(N^2+ 7N + 10\) requires abstract reasoning. When the leading coefficient is not a square number (as in the second half of the activity), an additional step of multiplying is needed to make the leading coefficient a square number. To keep the value of an expression unchanged, students need to remember that they can only multiply the expression by 1, but the 1 can be obtained by, say, multiplying by 5 and then by \(\frac {1}{5}\).</p>
<p>Before offering support, allow students to make sense of these processes and to discuss with their partner. The work encourages students to persevere in sense-making and problem-solving and to make use of structure. It also prompts students to attend to precision. As they make symbolic substitutions, students need to be clear about what the variables stand for and how the substitutions transform the expressions.</p>
<p>Later in the unit, students will encounter the use of a placeholder, such as done here, as a way to derive the quadratic formula. If desired, this activity can be done at that point to warm students up to the idea of using a placeholder.</p>
<p>If time is limited and if desired, the activity could be split into two halves and done separately (over two class periods).</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Display these expressions for all to see and ask students which expressions would be easier to write in factored form and why.</p>
<p>\(4x^2&minus; 12x + 8\)</p>
<p>\(t^2&minus; 6t + 8\)</p>
<p>\(d^2+ d &minus; 20\)</p>
<p>\(9x^2+ 3x &minus; 20\)</p>
<p>Students are likely to say that the second and the third expressions are easier because the coefficient of the squared term in each of those is 1 (or there isn't another number that needs to be factored aside from the constant term). Tell students that they will study another strategy that can simplify the process of rewriting quadratic expressions into factored form.</p>
<p>Consider arranging students in groups of two and asking them to think quietly about at least the first couple of problems before discussing with their partner. After students have had a chance to make sense of the first worked example, pause for a class discussion. Make sure that students can follow what is happening in the shown steps before trying to apply it with new expressions.</p>
<p>Pause for another class discussion after students have analyzed the first worked example. Before students proceed, clarify what is happening in each step of the rewriting process when the leading coefficient is not a square number.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p> Here is a clever way to think about quadratic expressions that can make it easier to find their factored form.</p>
<p>Factor \(9x^2+21x +10\).</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Notice the square root of the first term, \(3x\), is a factor of the second term.</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Rewrite in terms of \(3x\). The third term is unchanged.<br>
  \(= (3x)^2+7(3x) +10\) </p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Substitute \(N\) for the \(3x\).<br>
  \(= N^2+ 7N +10\) </p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  Factor the new trinomial.<br>
  \(= (N + 2)(N + 5)\)</p>
<p>Step 5<br>
  Replace \(N\) with \(3x\) to find the final factored form.<br>
  \(= (3x + 2)(3x + 5)\)</p>
<p>Using this substitution method creates a simpler trinomial that we may factor more easily.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Use the distributive property, or FOIL, to expand and simplify \((3x + 2)(3x + 5)\). Write the resulting expression in standard form. Be prepared to explain if it is equivalent to \(9x^2+21x + 10\).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \((3x + 2)(3x + 5) = 9x^2 + 15x + 6x + 10 = 9x^2 + 21x + 10\). Yes, the expressions are equivalent.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Study the substitution method and make sense of what was done in each step. Why might the simplified trinomial using \(N\) be simpler to factor?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The trinomial using \(N\) has a squared term with a coefficient of 1. Its factors can be found more easily.</p>
<p>In questions 3 and 4, try this \(N\)-substitution method to write each of these expressions in factored form.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>\(4x^2 + 28x + 45\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The square root of the first term, \(2x\), is a factor of the second term, \(28x\).<br>
  The expression can be rewritten as \((2x)^2+14(2x) +45\).<br>
  Substitute \(N\) for the \(2x\): \(N^2 + 14N + 45\).<br>
  This new trinomial can be factored into \((N + 5)(N + 9)\).<br>
  Replace \(N\) with \(2x\) to find the final factored form: \((2x + 5)(2x + 9)\).<br>
  So, \(4x^2+ 28x + 45 = (2x + 5)(2x + 9)\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>\(25x^2 &minus; 35x + 6\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The square root of the first term, \(5x\), is a factor of the second term, \(35x\).<br>
  The expression can be rewritten as \((5x)^2&minus; 7(5x) + 6\).<br>
  Substitute \(N\) for the \(5x\): \(N^2&minus; 7N + 6\).<br>
  This new trinomial can be factored into \((N &minus; 6)(N &minus; 1)\).<br>
  Replace \(N\) with \(5x\) to find the final factored form: \((5x &minus; 6)(5x &minus; 1)\).<br>
  So, \(25x^2&minus; 35x + 6 = (5x &minus; 6)(5x &minus; 1)\).</p>
<p>You have probably noticed that the coefficient of the squared term in all of the previous examples is a perfect square. What if that coefficient is not a perfect square?</p>
<p>Here is an example of an expression whose squared term has a coefficient that is not a squared term.</p>
<p>\(5x^2+ 17x + 6\)</p>
<p>We see that multiplying the leading coefficient by 5 would make the first term into a perfect square, \(25x^2\). But, we cannot introduce a new factor that will impact the value of the expression.</p>
<p>We need to find a way to balance the impact of multiplying everything by 5.</p>
<p>Knowing this, we multiply the entire trinomial by \(\frac {1}{5}\) , since \(\frac {1}{5} \cdot 5\) is the same as multiplying by 1.</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Multiply by \(\frac {1}{5}\cdot 5\).<br>
  \(= \frac {1}{5} \cdot 5 (5x^2+17x +6)\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Distribute the 5 into the trinomial.<br>
  \(= \frac {1}{5}(25x^2+85x +30)\) </p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Rewrite in terms of the square root of the first term, \(5x\).<br>
  \(= \frac {1}{5}((5x)^2+17(5x) +30)\)</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  Substitute \(N\) for \(5x\).<br>
  \(= \frac {1}{5}(N^2+17N +30)\)</p>
<p>Step 5<br>
  Factor the trinomial.<br>
  \(= \frac {1}{5}(N + 15)(N + 2)\)</p>
<p>Step 6<br>
  Replace \(N\) with \(5x\) to find the final factored form.<br>
  \(= \frac {1}{5}(5x + 15)(5x + 2)\)</p>
<p>Step 7<br>
  Factor 5 out of one of the factors.<br>
  \(= \frac {1}{5} \cdot 5(x + 3)(5x + 2)\)</p>
<p>Step 8<br>
  \(\frac {1}{5}\cdot 5 = 1\)<br>
  \(= (x + 3)(5x + 2)\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>Use the distributive property, or FOIL, to expand and simplify \((x + 3)(5x + 2)\). Write the resulting expression in standard form. Be prepared to explain if it is equivalent to \(5x^2+17x +6\).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \((x + 3)(5x + 2) = 5x^2 + 2x + 15x + 6 = 5x^2+ 17x + 6\). Yes, the expressions are equivalent.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
  <li>Applying the same strategy from the example to a trinomial with a leading term of \(6x^2\), what is the multiplication expression equivalent to 1 you would use to rewrite the trinomial? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(\frac {1}{6} \cdot 6\); multiplying the leading term of the trinomial by 6 would result in a leading term of \(36x^2\), which is a perfect square.</p>
<p>For questions 7 and 8, try the \(N\)-method to write each of these expressions in factored form.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="7">
  <li>\(3x^2+ 16x + 5\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Multiply the expression by \(\frac {1}{3} \cdot 3\).</p>
<p>Distributing the 3 into the trinomial gives \(\frac {1}{3}(9x^2+48x +15)\).</p>
<p>Rewriting the expression in terms of the square root of the first term, \(3x\), gives \( \frac {1}{3}((3x)^2 +16(3x) + 15)\).</p>
<p>Substituting \(N\) for \(3x\) makes the expression \(\frac {1}{3}(N^2+16N +15)\), which can be factored into \(\frac {1}{3}(N + 15)(N + 1)\).</p>
<p>\(N\) can now be replaced with \(3x\) and the expression becomes \(\frac {1}{3}(3x + 15)(3x + 1)\).</p>
<p>Factor 3 out of the first factor, because \(\frac {1}{3} \cdot 3 = 1\).<br>
  \(\frac {1}{3}(3x + 15)(3x + 1) = (x + 5)(3x + 1)\)<br>
  So, \(3x^2+ 16x + 5 = (x + 5)(3x + 1)\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="8">
  <li>\(10x^2&minus; 41x + 4\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Multiply the expression by \(\frac {1}{10} \cdot 10\).</p>
<p>Distributing the 10 into the trinomial gives \(\frac {1}{10}(100x^2&minus; 410x + 40)\).<br>
  Rewriting the expression in terms of the square root of the first term, \(10x\), gives \(\frac {1}{10}((10x)^2&minus; 41(10x) + 40)\).<br>
  Substituting \(N\) for \(10x\) makes the expression \(\frac {1}{10}(N^2&minus; 41N + 40)\), which can be factored into \(\frac {1}{10}(N &minus; 40)(N &minus; 1)\).<br>
  \(N\) can now be replaced with \(10x\) and the expression becomes \(\frac {1}{10}(10x &minus; 40)(10x &minus; 1)\).<br>
  Factor 10 out of the first factor, because \(\frac {1}{10} \cdot 10 = 1\).<br>
  \(\frac {1}{10}(10x &minus; 40)(10x &minus; 1) = (x &minus; 4)(10x &minus; 1)\)<br>
  So, \(10x^2&minus; 41x + 4 = (x &minus; 4)(10x &minus; 1)\).</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>In the final steps of the last question, students multiply a number by a pair of factors, for example, \(\frac {1}{3}(3x + 15)(3x + 1)\). Some students may mistakenly apply the distributive property and multiply \(\frac {1}{3}\) to both \((3x + 15)\) and \((3x + 1)\). Remind students that the distributive property governs multiplication over addition and subtraction, and that \((3x + 15)\) and \((3x + 1)\) are being multiplied together, not added or subtracted.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their attempts to rewrite the expressions using the method they just learned. Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> "Do you think this method is simpler or harder than guessing and checking? Is it quicker or slower?" </li>
  <li> "In what ways is this method simpler? In what ways is it harder?" </li>
</ul>

<h4>Finding the Factors of Quadratic Expressions in Standard Form</h4>
<p>Let's look at a shortcut that can help to factor a complicated quadratic expression. This method will be useful only when the coefficient of the first term is a perfect square, such as 4 or 9.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong><br>
  \(4x^2+ 4x &minus; 3\)</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Rewrite the first two terms with \(2x\) as the common factor.<br>
  \(= (2x)^2+2(2x) &minus;3\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Substitute \(N\) for \(2x\).<br>
  \(= N^2+2N &minus;3\) </p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Factor the simplified expression.<br>
  \(= (N + 3)(N &minus; 1)\)</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  Replace \(N\) with \(2x\).<br>
  \(= (2x + 3)(2x &minus; 1)\)</p>
<p>Here is an example of an expression whose squared term has a coefficient that is not a squared term. A different method can still be applied.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong><br>
  \(5x^2+ 27x &minus; 18\)</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Multiply by \(\frac {1}{5} \cdot 5\) to make a coefficient with a squared term without impacting the overall value of the expression.<br>
  \(= \frac {1}{5} \cdot 5 (5x^2+27x &minus;18)\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Distribute the 5.<br>
  \(= \frac {1}{5}(25x^2+135x &minus;90)\) </p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Rewrite the first two terms with \(5x\) as the common factor.<br>
  \(= \frac {1}{5}((5x)^2+27(5x) &minus;90)\) </p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  Substitute \(N\) for \(5x\).<br>
  \(= \frac {1}{5}(N^2+27N &minus;90)\)</p>
<p>Step 5<br>
  Factor the simplified expression.<br>
  \(= \frac {1}{5}(N + 30)(N &minus; 3)\) </p>
<p>Step 6<br>
  Replace \(N\) with \(5x\).<br>
  \(= \frac {1}{5}(5x + 30)(5x &minus; 3)\) </p>
<p>Step 7<br>
  Factor 5 out of one of the expressions.<br>
  \(= \frac {1}{5} \cdot 5(x + 6)(5x &minus; 3)\) </p>
<p>Step 8<br>
  \(\frac {1}{5} \cdot 5 = 1\)<br>
  \(= (x + 6)(5x &minus; 3)\) </p>
<p>Step 9<br>
  Use the distributive property, or FOIL, to expand \((x + 6)(5x &minus; 3)\). Is it equivalent to \(5x^2+ 27x &minus; 18\)?</p>
<p> \((x + 6)(5x &minus; 3)\)</p>
<p> \(= 5x^2+ 30x &minus; 3x &minus; 18\)</p>
<p>\(= 5x^2+ 27x &minus; 18\)</p>
<p> They are equivalent. \({\style{color:red}\checkmark}\)</p>

<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to use the shortcuts you just learned to find the factored form of a quadratic equation:</p>
<p>\(3x^2+25x +42\) </p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Multiply by \(\frac {1}{3} \cdot 3\) to make a coefficient with a squared term without impacting the overall value of the expression.<br>
  \(= \frac {1}{3} \cdot 3 (3x^2 + 25x + 42)\) </p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Distribute the 3.<br>
  \(= \frac {1}{3}(9x^2 +75x +126)\) </p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Rewrite the first two terms with \(3x\) as the common factor.<br>
  \(= \frac {1}{3}((3x)^2+ 25(3x) + 126)\) </p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  Substitute \(N\) for \(3x\).<br>
  \(= \frac {1}{3}(N^2+25N +126)\)</p>
<p>Step 5<br>
  Factor the simplified expression.<br>
  \(= \frac {1}{3}(N + 18)(N + 7)\) </p>
<p>Step 6<br>
  Replace \(N\) with \(3x\).<br>
  \(= \frac {1}{3}(3x + 18)(3x + 7)\)</p>
<p>Step 7<br>
  Factor 3 out of one of the expressions.<br>
  \(= \frac {1}{3}(3x + 18)(3x + 7)\)</p>
<p>Step 8<br>
  \(\frac {1}{3} \cdot 3 = 1\)<br>
  \(= (x + 6)(3x +7)\) </p>
<p>The factored form is \((x + 6)(3x + 7)\).</p>
