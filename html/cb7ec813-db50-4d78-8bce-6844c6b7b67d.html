<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity serves two main goals. It prompts students to look closely at appropriate domains for quadratic functions given the situations they represent. It also gives them an opportunity to identify or estimate the vertex of the graph and the zeros of the functions, and then to interpret them in context.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>In the previous activity, we saw a function representing the revenue, in thousands of dollars, from selling new movies at \(x\) dollars. If we graph the equation \(r=x(18-x)\) using graphing technology, it would produce a graph like this:</p>
<p><img alt='Graph with \(x\)-axis labeled with price in dollars and \(y\)-axis labeled with revenue in thousands of dollars." height="201' height="268" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/763a11b765e8a6f0000553133d0269bb64ddafa3" width="434"/></p>
<p>Then, discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li> “What domain is appropriate for the price of a new movie?” (The price can’t be negative and it can’t be more than \($18\), or else the revenue will be negative, which is not possible, assuming they are selling a non-negative number of downloads for a non-negative price. So an appropriate domain would be \(18 \leq x \leq 18\). The part of the graph to the left of the vertical axis has no meaning because we can’t have a negative price. The part representing a price above \($18\) would mean the company is losing money, so it has meaning, but it is unlikely to be considered if the company is trying to maximize revenue.) </li>
<li> “What are the zeros of the function? What do they tell us in this situation?” (\(0\) and \(18\). They tell us the prices at which the company would earn no revenue.) </li>
<li> “What is the vertex of the graph representing the function? What does it tell us in this situation?” (It appears to be at \((9,81)\). It tells us the price that would produce the greatest revenue.) </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell students they will now think about the domain, vertex, and zeros of a few quadratic functions we have seen so far.</p>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two to four. Consider asking each group to work on only 1 – 2 functions and then to share their findings with the class, or choosing only a couple of functions for the class to investigate. If the activity is divided among groups and if time permits, consider asking each group to prepare a presentation or to display their work for a gallery walk.</p>

<p>Use this routine to prepare students for the whole-class discussion. Ask students to select one of the functions and to prepare a visual display of their work. Students should consider how to display their reasoning so that another student can interpret what they see. Suggest that students should add notes and details to the graphs or functions to help communicate their thinking. Arrange students in groups of two, and provide two or three minutes of quiet think time for students to read and interpret each other's work before a whole-class discussion.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here are three sets of descriptions and equations that represent some familiar quadratic functions. The graphs show what a graphing technology may produce when the equations are graphed. For a more accurate answer, use the graphing tool or technology outside the course. Graph the equation that represents this scenario using the Desmos tool below.

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may confuse zeros and horizontal intercepts (\(x\)-intercepts). Watch for students who write the zeros as ordered pairs such as \((25,0)\) rather than \(25\). Emphasize that while these two terms are related, there is a difference. A zero is an input value that makes the function’s output \(0\), and the horizontal intercept is the point where the graph of the function meets the horizontal axis. A zero of a function is the \(x\)-coordinate of an \(x\)-intercept of its graph.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite groups to share their responses and explanations. If not already discussed or displayed by students, show examples of graphs that are each adjusted for a domain appropriate for the function represented.</p>
<p>Explain that the graph of a quadratic function may or may not show the vertex, depending on the situation it represents.</p>
<p>Here are graphs representing the functions defined by \(f(n)=n^2+4\) and \(h(t)=576-16t^2\) (in the second and fourth questions), each adjusted for the domain appropriate in the situation. In each graph, the \(y\)-intercept is the vertex, but because a negative domain is not applicable, we don’t see a “turn” in the graph (where the output changes from increasing to decreasing, or vice versa).</p>

<ul>
<li> The function \(f\) represents the number of squares at step \(n\) of a geometric pattern. Because partial step numbers are not possible, it makes sense for the graph to show discrete points at whole-number input values, rather than a continuous curve that includes all rational numbers for the input. </li>
<li> The function \(h\) models the height of an object \(t\) seconds after being dropped. Because a negative number of seconds is not meaningful here, assuming the object stops once it hits the ground (at 6 seconds), an appropriate domain for the function would be \(0 \leq t \leq 6\). </li>
