<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity serves two main goals. It prompts students to look closely at appropriate domains for quadratic functions given the situations they represent. It also gives them an opportunity to identify or estimate the vertex of the graph and the zeros of the functions, and then to interpret them in context.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>In the previous activity, we saw a function representing the revenue, in thousands of dollars, from selling new movies at \(x\) dollars. If we graph the equation \(r=x(18-x)\) using graphing technology, it would produce a graph like this:</p>
<p><img alt='Graph with \(x\)-axis labeled with price in dollars and \(y\)-axis labeled with revenue in thousands of dollars." height="201' height="268" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/763a11b765e8a6f0000553133d0269bb64ddafa3" width="434"></p>
<p>Then, discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> &ldquo;What domain is appropriate for the price of a new movie?&rdquo; (The price can&rsquo;t be negative and it can&rsquo;t be more than \($18\), or else the revenue will be negative, which is not possible, assuming they are selling a non-negative number of downloads for a non-negative price. So an appropriate domain would be \(18 \leq x \leq 18\). The part of the graph to the left of the vertical axis has no meaning because we can&rsquo;t have a negative price. The part representing a price above \($18\) would mean the company is losing money, so it has meaning, but it is unlikely to be considered if the company is trying to maximize revenue.) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;What are the zeros of the function? What do they tell us in this situation?&rdquo; (\(0\) and \(18\). They tell us the prices at which the company would earn no revenue.) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;What is the vertex of the graph representing the function? What does it tell us in this situation?&rdquo; (It appears to be at \((9,81)\). It tells us the price that would produce the greatest revenue.) </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell students they will now think about the domain, vertex, and zeros of a few quadratic functions we have seen so far.</p>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two to four. Consider asking each group to work on only 1&ndash;2 functions and then to share their findings with the class, or choosing only a couple of functions for the class to investigate. If the activity is divided among groups and if time permits, consider asking each group to prepare a presentation or to display their work for a gallery walk.</p>

    <p>Use this routine to prepare students for the whole-class discussion. Ask students to select one of the functions and to prepare a visual display of their work. Students should consider how to display their reasoning so that another student can interpret what they see. Suggest that students should add notes and details to the graphs or functions to help communicate their thinking. Arrange students in groups of two, and provide two or three minutes of quiet think time for students to read and interpret each other's work before a whole-class discussion.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here are three sets of descriptions and equations that represent some familiar quadratic functions. The graphs show what a graphing technology may produce when the equations are graphed. For a more accurate answer, use the graphing tool or technology outside the course. Graph the equation that represents this scenario using the Desmos tool below.
  <br>(Students had access to Desmos.)
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Describe a <strong><span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip"> domain</span></strong> that is appropriate for the situation. Think about any upper or lower limits for the input, as well as whether all numbers make sense as the input. Write the domain as an inequality. Then, describe how the graph should be modified to show the domain that makes sense. </li>
  <li> Describe a <strong><span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip"> range</span></strong> that is appropriate for the situation. Think about any upper or lower limits for the input, as well as whether all numbers make sense as the input. Write the range as an inequality. What does the range mean in this situation? Then, describe how the graph should be modified to show the range that makes sense.</li>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may confuse zeros and horizontal intercepts (\(x\)-intercepts). Watch for students who write the zeros as ordered pairs such as \((25,0)\) rather than \(25\). Emphasize that while these two terms are related, there is a difference. A zero is an input value that makes the function&rsquo;s output \(0\), and the horizontal intercept is the point where the graph of the function meets the horizontal axis. A zero of a function is the \(x\)-coordinate of an \(x\)-intercept of its graph.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite groups to share their responses and explanations. If not already discussed or displayed by students, show examples of graphs that are each adjusted for a domain appropriate for the function represented.</p>
<p>Explain that the graph of a quadratic function may or may not show the vertex, depending on the situation it represents.</p>
<p>Here are graphs representing the functions defined by \(f(n)=n^2+4\) and \(h(t)=576-16t^2\) (in the second and fourth questions), each adjusted for the domain appropriate in the situation. In each graph, the \(y\)-intercept is the vertex, but because a negative domain is not applicable, we don&rsquo;t see a &ldquo;turn&rdquo; in the graph (where the output changes from increasing to decreasing, or vice versa).</p>

<ul>
  <li> The function \(f\) represents the number of squares at step \(n\) of a geometric pattern. Because partial step numbers are not possible, it makes sense for the graph to show discrete points at whole-number input values, rather than a continuous curve that includes all rational numbers for the input. </li>
  <li> The function \(h\) models the height of an object \(t\) seconds after being dropped. Because a negative number of seconds is not meaningful here, assuming the object stops once it hits the ground (at 6 seconds), an appropriate domain for the function would be \(0 \leq t \leq 6\). </li>

Some of the points of this function are (negative 6 comma 0), (negative 4 comma 320) and (negative 2 comma 512) to a maximum at (0 comma 576) then decreasing through (2 comma 512), (4 comma 320) and (6 comma 0).&lt;/p&gt;" height="287" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/22710f1e7cfc5f8d5c2b14fc760a640611ae9322" width="262"></p>
<p>Find the domain of the function.</p>
<ul>
  <li> The <strong><span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip"> domain</span></strong> is the \(t\) values, \(0 \leq t \leq 6\) or only numbers from \(0\) up through \(6\). Negative values of time don&rsquo;t make sense here, so the part of the graph to the left side of the vertical axis has no meaning. The object hits the ground \(6\) seconds after being dropped, so values greater than \(6\) are not meaningful. </li>
</ul>
<p>Find the range of the function.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong><span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip"> range</span></strong> of the height of the function is from the initial height down to the ground. In this case, since the object is being dropped from a height of 576 feet and falls to the ground, the range of the function is [0, 576]. This means that the object's height will be between 0 feet (when it hits the ground) and 576 feet (when it is initially dropped).</li>

<ul>
  <li> The <strong><span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip"> vertex (of a graph)</span></strong> is the peak of the parabola, or the maximum, at the point \((0,576)\). It tells us the time when the height is the greatest. </li>
</ul>
<p>Find the zeros and describe their meaning.</p>
<ul>
  <li> The <strong><span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip"> zero of the function</span></strong> is \(6\). It tells us that the height of the object is \(0\) feet at \(6\) seconds after being dropped, or the time when the object hits the ground. </li>
</ul>
<li> The zero of the function is \(6\). It tells us that the height of the object is \(0\) feet at \(6\) seconds after being dropped, or the time when the object hits the ground. </li>
