<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students learn about the zero product property. They use it to reason about the solutions to quadratic equations that each have a quadratic expression in factored form on one side and 0 on the other side. They see that when an expression is a product of two or more factors and that product is 0, one of the factors must be 0. This fact enables us to find unknown values in the factored expression.</p>
<p>Students also continue to make connections to their earlier work on quadratic functions. They have seen that sometimes we want to find the input values of a function when the output is zero. They also learned that the factored form can help us identify the zeros of a quadratic function and the \(x\)-intercepts of its graph. They have not investigated how or why this form enables us to do so, however. Here, students make use of the structure of a quadratic expression in factored form and the zero product property to understand the connections between the numbers in the form and the \(x\)-intercepts of its graph.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> Given quadratic equations where one side is a product of factors and the other is zero, find the solution(s) and explain (orally and in writing) why the solutions make the equation true. </li>
<li> Explain (in written and spoken language) that the "zero product property" means that if the product of two numbers is 0, then one of the factors must also be 0. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> Explain the meaning of the "zero product property."</li>
<li> Find solutions to quadratic equations when one side is a product of factors and the other side is zero. </li>
</ul>
