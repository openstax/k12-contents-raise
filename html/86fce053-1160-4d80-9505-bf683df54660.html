<h3>Optional Activity</h3>
<p>This optional activity further addresses the skill of choosing an appropriate graphing window when using graphing technology. In an earlier activity, students looked at how adjusting the graphing window affects the usefulness of the graph. Here, they gauge the reasonableness of a graphing window given an equation and a description of a function.</p>
<p>Because exponential functions eventually grow very rapidly, the graph tends to quickly go off the screen if the domain is too large. The graphing window can be adjusted to display large values for the vertical axis, but in doing so, the output values for most of the domain will all look like they are essentially 0.</p>
<p>To decide on the reasonableness of the given graphing boundaries, students may evaluate the function at the endpoints of the domain for the graphing window. Look for students who think carefully about the domain, observing that, based on the context, the equation probably does not model even modest negative values of the input variable. This activity represents scaffolded practice for an important aspect of mathematical modeling.</p>

<p>The equation \(m=20 \cdot (0.8)^h\) models the amount of medicine \(m\) (in milligrams) in a patient&rsquo;s body as a function of hours, \(h\), after injection.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> Without using a graphing tool, decide if the following horizontal and vertical boundaries are suitable for graphing this function.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
    Explain your reasoning.<br>
    \(-10&lt;h&lt;100\)<br>
    \(
    -100&lt;m&lt;1,000\) <br>
<br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> Your answers may vary, but here are some sample responses to compare your answers.<br>
<br>
    No; Sample responses: There is probably no medicine left in the body 100 hours after injection, so it is not helpful to graph all the way to an \(h\) value of 100. And if there was any medicine in the body before injection, it wouldn&rsquo;t be accounted for by this equation, so \(h\)&nbsp;should probably start at 0. The scale for the vertical axis is also unreasonable. The medicine is decreasing in amount, starting from 20 milligrams, so 1,000 for the upper end of the axis is far too large. The negative values for \(m\)&nbsp;are also not needed because a negative amount of medicine would not make any sense here.

    Answers vary. A reasonable graph would have an \(h\)-axis that shows values from 0 to around 20 and an \(m\)-axis showing values from 0 to somewhere in the low 20s. Here is an example :<br>
<br>
    Points plotted on the coordinate plane, showing exponential decay. Horizontal axis from 0 to 22.5, labeled \(h\). Vertical axis from 0 to 22.5, labeled \(m\). <br>
