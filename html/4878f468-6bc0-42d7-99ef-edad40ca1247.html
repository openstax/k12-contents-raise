<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<p>Many sequences start with the terms 2 and 8.</p>
<ol>
<li>
    Find the next two terms of the arithmetic sequence 2, 8, ____, ____.
  </li>
<li>
    Find the next two terms of the geometric sequence 2, 8, ____, ____.
  </li>
<li>
    Find two possible next terms of a sequence 2, 8, ____, ____ that is neither geometric nor arithmetic.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Student Response</h4>

<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding. Both Lessons 4 and 5 include arithmetic and geometric sequences for students to practice identifying and generating, but the focus is on new aspects (spreadsheets and functions), so you&rsquo;ll have to adjust the activities to address this goal.</p>
