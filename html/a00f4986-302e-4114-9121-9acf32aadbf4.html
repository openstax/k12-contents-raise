<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students solve a variety of quadratic equations by integrating what they learned about rewriting quadratic expressions in factored form and their understanding of the zero product property. They begin by analyzing and explaining the steps in a solution strategy, and then they apply their observations to solve other equations.</p>
<p>As students work, notice the equations many students find challenging and those on which errors are commonly made. Discuss these challenges and errors during the activity synthesis.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Display Tyler's four steps in the activity statement for all to see.</p>
<p>Give students one minute of quiet time to study the example. Ask them to be prepared to share at least one thing they notice and one thing they wonder. Give students another minute to discuss their observations and questions with a partner.</p>
<p>Students may notice that:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> The right side is equal to 0 after the first step. </li>
  <li> There are two equations starting in Step 3. </li>
  <li> The product of 11 and &ndash;9 is the constant term in Step 2. </li>
</ul>
<p>Students may wonder:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> why there are two equations in the last two steps.</li>
  <li> where the \(-2n\) went when the expression on the left side was written in factored form.</li>
  <li> whether Tyler's work is correct.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, give students a moment to work quietly on the first four questions. Encourage students to use relevant mathematical vocabulary in their explanations (such as constant term, squared term, factored form, and zero product property).</p>
<p>Before students proceed to questions 5&ndash;9, pause for a class discussion. Ask students to explain each step of Tyler's solving process and record their explanations for all to see. Encourage students to use reasoning language as opposed to position language: for instance, say "he subtracted 99 from both sides" rather than "he moved the 99 over to the other side."</p>
<p>Make sure students recognize that Step 2 in Tyler&lsquo;s work involves finding two factors of &ndash;99 that add up to &ndash;2. Also discuss why there are two equations at the end. Students should recall that if two numbers multiply to equal 0, then one of the factors must be 0.</p>
<p>Ask students to solve as many equations in the second question as time permits.</p>
<h4>Student Activity </h4>
<p>To solve the equation \(n^2 &minus; 2n = 99\), Tyler wrote out the following steps. Analyze Tyler's work by explaining what Tyler did in each step.</p>
<p>Original equation<br>
  \(n^2&minus; 2n = 99\) </p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  \(n^2 &minus; 2n &minus; 99 = 0\) </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> What did Tyler do in Step 1? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Step 1: Subtract 99 from each side.</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  \((n &minus; 11)(n + 9) = 0\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li> What did Tyler do in Step 2? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Step 2: Rewrite the left side in factored form.</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  \(n &minus; 11 = 0\) or \(n + 9 = 0\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li> What did Tyler do in Step 3? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Step 3: Apply the zero product property, which leads to two separate equations.</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  \(n = 11\) and \(n = -9\) </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li> What did Tyler do in Step 4? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Step 4: Solve each equation by performing the same operation on each side.</p>
<p>For questions 5&ndash;9, solve each equation by rewriting it in factored form and using the zero product property.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>\(x^2 + 8x + 15 = 0\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=-3\) and \(x=-5\) because \((x + 3)(x + 5) = 0\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
  <li>\(x^2&minus; 8x + 12 = 5\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=7\) and \(x=1\) because \((x &minus; 7)(x &minus; 1) = 0\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="7">
  <li>\(x^2&minus; 10x &minus; 11 = 0\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=11\) and \(x=-1\) because \((x &minus; 11)(x + 1) = 0\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="8">
  <li>\(49 &minus; x^2= 0\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=7\) and \(x=-7\) because \((7 &minus; x)(7 + x) = 0\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="9">
  <li>\((x + 4)(x + 5) &minus; 30 = 0\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=-10\) and \(x=1\) because \((x + 10)(x &minus; 1) = 0\).</p>
<h4>Student-Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>Solve this equation and explain or show your reasoning.</p>
<p>\((x^2 &minus; x &minus; 20)(x^2+ 2x &minus; 3) = (x^2+ 2x &minus; 8)(x^2&minus; 8x + 15)\)</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x = 5\), \(x = -4\), and \(x = \frac {9}{7}\)</p>
<p>Rewriting each quadratic expression in factored form gives:</p>
<p>\((x &minus; 5)(x + 4)(x &minus; 1)(x + 3) = (x + 4)(x &minus; 2)(x &minus; 5)(x &minus; 3)\) </p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Writing the equation so that it equals zero yields:</p>
<p>\((x &minus; 5)(x + 4)(x &minus; 1)(x + 3) &minus; (x + 4)(x &minus; 2)(x &minus; 5)(x &minus; 3) = 0\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Notice that the factors \((x &minus; 5)\) and \((x + 4)\) appear in each of the terms. This means we can factor those binomials to the front of our expression. This means our expression is a list of factors and not terms.</p>
<p>\((x &minus; 5) (x + 4) [(x &minus; 1)(x + 3) &minus; (x &minus; 2)(x &minus; 3)] = 0\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Now, using the zero product property, we set each of the factors equal to zero and solve.</p>
<p>\((x &minus; 5) = 0\), so \(x = 5\).</p>
<p>\((x + 4) = 0\), so \(x = -4\).</p>
<p>\([(x &minus; 1)(x + 3) &minus; (x &minus; 2)(x &minus; 3)] = 0\)</p>
<p>Solving this equation will take a little more work!</p>
<p>\(x^2 + 2x &minus; 3 &minus; (x^2 &minus; 5x + 6) = 0\)<br>
  \(x^2 + 2x &minus; 3 &minus; x^2 + 5x &minus; 6 = 0\)<br>
  \(7x &minus; 9 = 0\)<br>
  \(7x = 9\)<br>
  \(x = \frac {9}{7}\)</p>
<p>Solving the linear equation gives \(x = \frac {9}{7}\).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Consider displaying the solutions for all to see and discussing only the equations that students found challenging and any common errors.</p>
<p>The last equation is unlike most equations students have seen. Invite students to share how they solved that equation. Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li>"Can we use the zero product property to write \(x + 4 = 0\) and \(x + 5 = 0\)? Why or why not?" (No. The zero product property can only be applied to products that equal 0. The expression \((x + 4)(x + 5) &minus; 30\) has a product for one of its terms, but the expression itself is a difference.)</li>
  <li>"How can it be solved, other than by graphing?" (We can expand the factored expressions using the distributive property and write an equivalent equation: \(x^2 + 9x + 20 &minus; 30 = 0\) or \(x^2+ 9x &minus; 10 = 0\). This last equation can then be written as \((x + 10)(x &minus; 1) = 0\), which allows it to be solved.)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Using Factored Form and the Zero Product Property to Solve Quadratic Equations</h4>
<p>We have seen quadratic equations in many different forms. Let's look at an example in which we find the factored form, and then use the zero product property to solve.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Solve \(x^2 + 3x &minus; 50 = -10\).</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Set the equation equal to 0 by adding 10 to both sides.</p>
<p>\(x^2+ 3x &minus; 40 = 0\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Find the factored form.<br>
  Which numbers have a product of &ndash;40 and a sum of +3?</p>
<p>\((x + 8)(x &minus; 5) = 0\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Use the zero product property to solve.<br>
  Set each factor equal to 0 and solve.</p>
<p>\((x + 8) = 0\;\;\;\;(x &minus; 5) = 0\)</p>
<p>\(x = -8\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;x = 5\)</p>
<p>The solution is \(x = -8\) and \(x = 5\).</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Solve \(x^2+ 12x + 21 = -15\).</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Set the equation equal to 0 by adding 15 to both sides.</p>
<p>\(x^2 + 12x + 36 = 0\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Find the factored form.<br>
  Which numbers have a product of 36 and a sum of 12?</p>
<p>\((x + 6)(x + 6) = 0\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Use the zero product property to solve.<br>
  Set each factor equal to 0 and solve. The factors are the same, so there is one solution.</p>
<p>\((x + 6) = 0\;\;\;\;(x + 6) = 0\)</p>
<p> \(x = -6\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;x = -6\) </p>
<p>The only solution is \(x = -6\).</p>
