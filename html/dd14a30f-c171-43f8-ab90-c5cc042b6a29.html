<h4>Optional Activity (20 minutes)</h4>

<p>The activities in this lesson are an extension of the TEKS expectations.</p>
<p>In this activity, students learn to use graphing technology to graph an equation in function notation, evaluate the
  function at a specific input value, create a table of inputs and outputs, and identify the coordinates of the points
  along a graph. They also revisit how to set an appropriate graphing window.<br></p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Display the equation \(B(x)=10x+25\) for all to see. Ask students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;How would you go about finding the value of \(B(1.482)\)?&rdquo; (Substitute 1.482 into the expression
    \(10x+25\) and evaluate, or use the graph of \(y=10x+25\) to estimate the \(y\)-value when
    \(x\) is 1.482.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How would you find the value of \(x\) that makes \(B(x)=103.75\) true? Try solving the equation."
    (Solve \(10x+25=103.75\), or use the graph of \(y=10x+25\) to estimate the \(x\)-value when \(y\) is
    103.75.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Explain that while it&rsquo;s possible to use a graph to find or estimate unknown input or output values, it is hard
  to be precise when using a hand-drawn or printed graph. We can evaluate the expression or solve the equation
  algebraically, but computing by hand can get cumbersome (though a calculator can take care of the most laborious
  part). Let's see how graphing technology can help us!</p>
<p>The digital version of this activity includes instructions for using the Desmos Math Tool to graph an equation,
  change the graphing window, and find the output of a function for a given input. If students will be using different
  graphing technology, consider preparing alternate instructions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Demonstrate how to graph \(B(x)=10x+25\), change the graphing window, and find \(B(4)\) on the
    graph.</li>
  <li>Ask students to find the value of \(x\) when \(B(x)\) is 100. Then, demonstrate some ways (other
    than approximating visually) to solve for \(x\) given \(B(x)=100\): 
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
      <li>Trace the line. Coordinates appear as we move along the line. Stop when the \(y\)-coordinate is 100 and see
        what the \(x\)-coordinate is.</li>
      <li>Type \(y=100\) in the expression list. A horizontal line appears. Find the intersection of this line and
        the graph of \(B\).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Ask students to use one or both of these strategies to complete the activity.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share any insights they had while using the graphing tool and techniques to evaluate expressions
  and solve equations. In what ways might the tool and techniques be handy? When might they be limited?</p>
<p>Also discuss any issues that students encountered while completing the task&mdash;technical or otherwise.</p>
<p>If desired, consider showing another way to obtain input-output pairs of a function in Desmos.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assign a new input variable, say \(n\), to function \(B\). If we enter \(n,B(n)\) in the expression
  list, activate a slider for \(n\), and enable the option to label points, the graph will show the coordinate pair
  for any value of \(n\).</p>

  <h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
  <p>Give students additional time to share their insights in small groups before the whole-class discussion. Invite
    groups to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using the graphing tool and to rehearse what they will say
    when they share with the whole class. Rehearsing provides students with additional opportunities to speak and
    clarify their thinking, and will improve the quality of explanations shared during the whole-class discussion.

<h3>4.5.4: Self Check</h3>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold"><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the
      concepts explored in the activity.</em></p>
      <p class="os-raise-text-bold">QUESTION:</p>
        <p>The function \(D\) is defined by the equation \(D(x)=2.5x+12\).</p>
        <p dir="ltr">Which describes the window that can be used to find the value of \(x\) when \(D(x)=23.25\) using
          graphing technology and gives the correct value of \(x\)?</p>

      </td>
      <td>
       Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: The value 23.25 is the output value, not the input value.
          The window must include the value of \(D(x)\) and the estimated value of \(x\). The answer is: Graph
          \(y=2.5x+12\), \(y=23.25\); window: \(x\) from 0 to 10, \(y\) from 20 to 25; \(x=4.5\).

      <td>
        That&rsquo;s correct! Check yourself: Graph each equation using a window for \(y\) close to the given value
          and a window for \(x\) close to an estimated value. The value of \(x\) where the lines meet is 4.5.

      <td>
        Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: be sure to graph the full equation for \(D(x)\), using a
          window for \(y\) close to the given value and a window for \(x\) close to an estimated value. The answer is:
          Graph \(y=2.5x+12\), \(y=23.25\); window: \(x\) from 0 to 10, \(y\) from 20 to 25; \(x=4.5\).
