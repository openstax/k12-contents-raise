<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students are <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/22f3e55f9eda684af17e597e112cc658518dfe77" target="_blank">given cards</a> displaying scatter plots of data that can be fit by linear models with varying accuracy. Cards show data that are random, poorly fit by a linear model, well fit by a linear model, and better fit by another type of function, such as quadratic or exponential. Students should begin to recognize these differences and the connection to the correlation coefficient.</p>
<p>A sorting task gives students opportunities to analyze representations, statements, and structures closely and make connections.</p>
<p>Monitor for different ways groups choose to categorize the scatter plots, but especially for categories that distinguish between plots that would be modeled well with a linear function and those that would not.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Tell them that in this activity, they will sort some cards into categories of their choosing. When they sort the scatter plots, they should work with their partner to come up with categories. Distribute one copy of the blackline master to each group.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Your teacher will give you a set of cards that show scatter plots of data. Sort the cards into 2 categories of your choosing. Be prepared to explain the meaning of your categories. Then, sort the cards into 2 categories in a different way. Be prepared to explain the meaning of your new categories.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Scatter plots that look linear: C, D, F, G. Scatter plots that are not very linear: A, B, E, H, I, J</li>
  <li>Generally increasing: E, F, G, I. Generally decreasing: A, C, D, J. Not really increasing or decreasing: B, H</li>
</ul>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Now, display the scatterplots with the lines of best fit and \(r\) values included (see images below). <br>

  After displaying the graphs, give students 1 minute of quiet time to think, and then 1 minute to discuss the things they notice with their partner, followed by a whole-class discussion.</p>
<p>Among the things students should notice are:</p>
<li>The sign of \(r\) is the same as the sign of the slope of the line of best fit.</li>
<li>The values for \(r\) seem to go from &ndash;1 to 1.</li>
<li>The closer \(r\) is to 1 or &ndash;1, the stronger the linear relationship between the variables.</li>
<li>The closer \(r\) is to 0, the weaker the linear relationship between the variables.</li>

<p>Emphasize with students that the sign of the correlation coefficient matches the sign of the slope of the line of best fit, but the value for \(r\) is not otherwise related to the slope. If \(r=0.8\), the line of best fit will have a positive slope, but whether the slope is 0.2 or 2,000 is not clear without examining the data.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select groups of students to share their categories and how they sorted their equations. You can choose as many different types of categories as time allows, but ensure that one set of categories distinguishes between plots that would be modeled well with a linear function and those that would not. Attend to the language that students use to describe their categories and equations, giving them opportunities to describe their equations more precisely. Highlight the use of terms like linear model, fit, and non-linear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the second part of the activity, encourage partners or groups to share their observations from the scatter plots, line of best fit, and \(r\)-values. Use questioning about the signs of the slopes and the \(r\)-values and the \(r\)-value numbers and the closeness of points to the line of best fit to elicit the sample responses. Write the four properties on the board/screen.</p>

<h4>Correlation Coefficient</h4>
<p>The correlation coefficient is a number between \(-1\) and \(+1\) (including \(-1\) and \(+1\)) that measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship. The correlation coefficient is denoted by the letter&nbsp;\(r\). Several scatter plots are shown below. The value of the correlation coefficient for the data displayed in each plot is also given.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When is the value of the correlation coefficient positive?</p>
<ul>
  <li>The correlation coefficient is positive when as the \(x\)-values increase, the \(y\)-values also tend to increase.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>When is the value of the correlation coefficient negative?</p>
<ul>
  <li>The correlation coefficient is negative when as the&nbsp;\(x\)-values increase, the \(y\)-values tend to decrease.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Is the linear relationship stronger when the correlation coefficient is closer to 0 or to 1 (or \(-1\))?</p>
<ul>
  <li>As the points form a stronger negative or positive linear relationship, the correlation coefficient gets farther from 0. Students note that when all of the points are on a line with a positive slope, the correlation coefficient is \(+1\). The correlation coefficient is \(-1\) if all of the points are on a line with a negative slope.&nbsp;</li>

<p>Which of the three scatter plots below shows the strongest linear relationship? Which shows the weakest linear relationship? Explain your answers.<br></p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p>The strongest linear relationship would be Scatter Plot 3. The points are closest to having a linear model. The weakest linear relationship would be Scatter Plot 2 because the points are spread apart the most and are less likely to have a strong linear relationship.</p><br>
