<p>Many of the situations we have seen that are characterized by exponential growth can also be viewed as functions. Review why we can think of them as functions and how they compare to other functions students have studied.</p>
<p>Consider a bacteria population \(p\), described by the equation \(9p=1,000 \cdot 2^t\), where \(t\)&nbsp;is the number of hours after it is first measured.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Complete the sentence for this situation: _____ is a function of _____.&rdquo; (The number of bacteria is a function of time, or \(p\)&nbsp;is a function of \(t\).) </li>
<li>&ldquo;How is \(p\)&nbsp;related to the function \(f\)&nbsp;given by \(f(t)=1,000 \cdot 2^t\)?&rdquo; (\(p=f(t)\))</li>
<li>&ldquo;How are these equations similar to or different from the equations you&rsquo;ve written previously, without function notation?&rdquo; (They express the relationships the same way. Both equations can be used to produce a table or graph or to answer questions about the bacteria population. The notation \(p=f(t)\) makes explicit that \(p\)&nbsp;depends on \(t\).) </li>
<li>&ldquo;How are the exponential functions here similar to or different from linear functions we saw earlier in the course?&rdquo; (Both functions represent relationships where one quantity is determined by another quantity, and there is only one possible output for every input. They are different in that linear functions grow by addition, and exponential functions grow by multiplication.) </li>
</ul>
