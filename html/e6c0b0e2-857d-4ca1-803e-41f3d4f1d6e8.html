<p>In this lesson, you will further develop the idea of equivalent equations by applying the concept of acceptable moves. Additionally, you will encounter equations that have no solutions with moves that appear to be acceptable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explain why some algebraic moves create equivalent equations but some do not.</li>
  <li>Describe how equivalent equations are related to the steps of solving equations.</li>
  <li>Explain what it means for an equation to have no solutions and recognize such an equation.</li>
</ul><span>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:<br></span>
