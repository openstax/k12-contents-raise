<h4>Write a System of Inequalities for a Situation</h4>
<p>For questions 1â€“4, use the following scenario to write, graph, and find solutions to a system of inequalities.</p>
<blockquote>Christy sells her photographs at a booth at a street fair. At the start of the day, she wants to have at least 25 photos to display at her booth. Each small photo she displays costs her $4, and each large photo costs her $10. She doesn&rsquo;t want to spend more than $200 on photos to display.</blockquote>

<p>The solution of the system is the region of the graph that is shaded the darkest. The boundary line sections that border the darkly shaded section are included in the solution, as are the points on the \(x\)-axis from \((25, 0)\) to \((50, 0)\).</p>
<p>To determine if 10 small and 20 large photos would work, we look at the graph to see if the point \((10, 20)\) is in the solution region. We could also test the point to see if it is a solution of both equations.</p>
<p>It is not, so Christy would not display 10 small and 20 large photos.</p>

  <p>To determine if 20 small and 10 large photos would work, we look at the graph to see if the point \((20, 10)\) is in the solution region. We could also test the point to see if it is a solution of both equations.</p>
  <p>It is, so Christy could choose to display 20 small and 10 large photos.</p>
  <p>Notice that we could also test the possible solutions by substituting the values into each inequality.</p>
