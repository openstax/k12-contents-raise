<div>Students will complete the following questions to practice the skills they have learned in this lesson.<br></div>
<p>For questions 1â€“4, use the situation and graph below:</p>
 
  <p>Andre bought a new bag of cat food. The next day, he opened it to feed his cat. The graph shows how many ounces were left in the bag on the days after it was bought.</p>
<p><img alt="Line on coordinate plane, origin O. Horizontal axis from 0 to 44 by 4&rsquo;s, days since bag was bought. Vertical axis 0 to 64 by 8&rsquo;s, ounces of cat food. Line passes through 0 comma 56 and 24 comma 16." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="238" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/8a41839540c92dd378bcb27baf29707c44cd53ac" width="315"><br></p>
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="1"> 
    <li>How many ounces of food were in the bag 12days after Andre bought it? &nbsp;</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong> 36. When \(x\) is 12, the \(y\) value is 36. </p><br></p>
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2"> 
    <li> How many days did it take for the bag to contain 16 ounces of food?</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>24. When \(y\) is 16, the \(x\) value is 24.<br><br></p>
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3"> 
    <li>How much did the bag weigh before it was opened?.</li>
  </ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>56. When \(x\) is 0, the \(y\) value is 56.<br><br></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4"> 
    <li>Approximately many days did it take for the bag to be empty?</li>
</ol>
    <p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>33. When \(y\) is 0, the \(x\) value is 33.<br> </p><br>
  
<p>For #5-9, use the problem and graph below:<br><br></p>
<p>A group of hikers is progressing steadily along an uphill trail. The graph shows their elevation (or height above sea level), in feet, at each distance from the start of the trail, in miles.</p>
<div><img alt="Graph of a line. Elevation, feet. Distance along trail, miles." height="179" role="image" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b8eb3dec29ba5c5c9029dfa3cbe813a4df970361" title="mamS5H5Jno6yyY8XAKvjyoLY" width="248"></div>   
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5"> 
  <li>What is the slope of the graph?. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>250. Use points \((0,500)\) and \((2,1000)\)</p> 
<p> \(m=\frac{1000-500}{2-1}=\frac{500}{2}=250\) </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6"> 
  <li>What does the slope tell us about this situation?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>The change in elevation as the hikers hike more miles.</li>
  <li>The change in miles as the elevation increases.</li>
  <li>Only the distance along the trial (miles).</li>
  <li>Only the elevation (feet).</li>  
</ul>
<p> <strong>Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The change in elevation as the hikers hike more miles<strong><br></strong><br></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="7"> 
      <li>Choose the
    equation that represents the relationship between the hikers' distance from the
    start of the trail, \(x\), and their elevation, \(y\).</li></ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>\(y=250x+500\). The slope is 250. The \(y\)-intercept, when \(x=0\), is 500.<br></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="8">
  <li>A kindergarten teacher bought $21 worth of stickers and cardstock for his class. The stickers cost $1.50 a sheet, and the cardstock cost $3.50 per pack. The equation&nbsp;\( 1.5s+3.5c=21 \) represents the relationship between sheets of stickers, \(s\), packs of cardstock, \(c\), and the dollar amount the kindergarten teacher spent on these supplies.&nbsp;
  <p><img alt="Line on grid, origin O. Horizontal axis, 0 to 18 by 2&rsquo;s, sheets of stickers. Vertical axis, 0 to 10 by 2&rsquo;s, packs of cardstock.

  </li>
</ol>  
  <p>What does the vertical intercept, (0,6), mean in this situation?</p>
<ul>
  <li>0 sheets of stickers and 6 packs of cardstock were bought.</li>
  <li>6 sheets of stickers and 0 packs of cardstock were bought.</li>
  <li>7 sheets of stickers and 3 packs of cardstock were bought.</li>
  <li>14 sheets of stickers and 6 packs of cardstock were bought.</li>

</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>0 sheets of stickers and 6 packs of cardstock were bought.</p><br>
