<p>For #5-9, use the
    problem and graph below:<br><br></p>
<p>A group of hikers is progressing steadily along an uphill trail.
    The graph shows their elevation (or height above sea level), in feet, at
    each distance from the start of the trail, in miles.</p>

    <p><br></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5"> 
<li>What is the slope of the graph?. </li></ol>

  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>250</p>
  <p><br></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6"> 
<li>What does the
    slope tell us about this situation?</li></ol>
<ul>
  <li>The change in
      elevation as the hikers hike more miles.</li>
  <li>The change in miles as the elevation
      increases.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The change in elevation as the hikers hike more
      miles<strong><br></strong><br>
