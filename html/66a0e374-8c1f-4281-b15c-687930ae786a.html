      Andre solved the companion equation and found \(3 = x\). Then, he tested a number greater than 3. That created a false mathematical statement so he concluded that any number greater than 3 would not be a solution.

      Priya solved the companion equation and found \(x = 3\). Then, she reasoned that the left side of the equation, \(4x + 3\), could be either negative or positive while the right side of the equation, \(18 - x\), would always be positive - if negative \(x\) values for are substituted into the expressions. So, the possible values for \(x\) need to include both positive and negative numbers. That happens when the \(x\) values are less than 3.

  <p> Compare your answer: <br> Your answer may vary, but here are some samples.</p>
  <p>Inequality A: \(\frac15p\gt&minus;10\)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>\(p&gt;-50\). Sample reasoning (after solving \(\frac15p=-10\) to get \(p=-50):\)
      <ul>
        <li>
          Using Andre's strategy: Test a value more than or less than -50, and check to see if that value gives a true statement when substituting back to the original inequality.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using Priya's strategy: If \(p\) is a negative number that is far away from 0, say -100, then \(\frac15p\) will be less than, not greater than, -10. This means the solutions must include positive numbers, so the solutions must be greater than -50.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p>Inequality B: \(4(x+7)\leq4(2x+8)\)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Sample reasoning using Priya's strategy (after solving \(4(x+7)=4(2x+8)\) and getting \((x=-1)\):
      <ul>
        <li>
          After dividing each side by 4, the left side of the inequality has \(x\), while the right side has \(2x\). This means the expression on the left side will be less than that on the right when \(x\) includes positive numbers, so \(x\) must be greater than or equal to -1. (In other words, for most negative values of \(x\), \(2x\) will be less than \(x\), which would make the inequality untrue.)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Inequality C: \(&minus;9n\lt36\)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sample reasoning using Priya's strategy (after solving \(-9n=36\) to get \(n=-4\)):
      <ul>
        <li>
          If \(n\) includes large positive numbers, then \(-9n\) will be smaller than 36, so \(n\) must include positive numbers which are greater than -4.
        </li>
        <li>
          If \(n\) is less than -4, then it would include negative numbers like -10, which means the value of \(-9n\) would be a positive number that is greater than 36, which makes the inequality untrue. So the solution must be greater than -4.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Inequality D: \(\frac{c}{3}\lt&minus;2(c&minus;7)\)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sample reasoning using Priya's strategy (after solving \(\frac{c}{3}=-2(c&minus;7)\) and getting \(c=6)\):

    <li>
      The right side of the inequality has \(-2c\) while the left side has \(\frac13c\). If \(c\) is a large positive number, \(-2c\) will be less than \(\frac13c\). If \(c\) is a negative number, \(-2c\) will be positive and greater than \(\frac13c\), so the solution must include negative numbers which are less than 6.
    </li>
    </li>
  </ul>
