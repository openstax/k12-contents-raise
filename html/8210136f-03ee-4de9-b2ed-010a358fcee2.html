<h4>Real-World Applications</h4>
<p>In this unit, your student will be learning how to solve quadratic equations using several methods. In the previous unit, students saw how quadratic functions can represent a variety of situations such as the height of a ball thrown into the air over time.</p>
<p>Look at this example.</p>
<p>A ball is thrown straight up, from 3 meters above the ground, with a velocity of 14 meters/second. When does it hit the ground?</p>
<p>The equation \(h = - 5t^2 + 14t + 3\) represents the height, \(h\), for time, \(t\), in seconds since the ball was thrown.</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(h = - 5t^2 +14t + 3\)</p>
<p>And the ball will hit the ground when the height is zero:</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(- 5t^2 + 14t + 3 = 0\)</p>
<p>In this unit, your student will learn to use the quadratic formula. The formula can be used to find the solutions to any quadratic equation in the form of \(ax^2+bx+c=0\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are numbers and \(a\) is not 0.</p>
<p>Here is the quadratic formula.</p>
<p>\(x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2- 4ac}}{2a}\)</p>
<p>The quadratic formula can be used to find the time when the ball hits the ground by solving \(- 5t^2 +14t + 3 = 0\), in which \(a=-5\), \(b=14\), and \(c=3\).</p>
<p>Substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) into the formula.</p>
<p>\(x=\frac{-(14) \pm \sqrt{(14)^2- (4)(-5)(3)}}{2(-5)}\)</p>
<p>Evaluate each part of the expression.</p>
<p>\(x=\frac{-14 \pm \sqrt{196+ 60}}{-10}\)</p>
<p>\(x=\frac{-14 \pm \sqrt{256}}{-10}\)</p>
<p>\(x=\frac{-14 \pm 16}{-10}\)</p>
<p>Write each equation separately.</p>
<p>\(x=\frac{-14+16}{-10}\) and \(x=\frac{-14-16}{-10}\)</p>
<p>Simplify.</p>
<p>\(x=\frac{2}{-10}=-\frac{1}{5}\) and \(x=\frac{-30}{-10}=3\)</p>
<p>Find the solution(s).</p>
<p>The equation has two solutions, \(x=-\frac{1}{5}\) and \(x=3\). The solution \(x=-\frac{1}{5}\) does not make sense for this problem because \(x\) represents time and time cannot be negative. The solution \(x=3\) means the ball hits the ground 3 seconds after being thrown in the air. The solution is \(x=3\).</p>
<p><strong>Here is a task to try with your student:</strong></p>
<p>Solve \(2x^2-13x+20=0\) using the quadratic equation.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>\(a=2\), \(b=-13\), and \(c=20\).</p>
<p>\(x=\frac{-(-13) \pm \sqrt{(-13)^2- (4)(2)(20)}}{2(2)}\)</p>
<p>\(x=\frac{13 \pm \sqrt{169- 160}}{4}\)</p>
<p>\(x=\frac{13 \pm 3}{4}\)</p>
<p>\(x=\frac{13+3}{4}=4\) and \(x=\frac{13-3}{4}=2.5\)</p>
<p>The solutions are \(x=4\) and \(x=2.5\).</p>
<h4>Video Lesson Summaries</h4>
<p>Here are the video lesson summaries for Unit 9: More Quadratic Equations. Each video highlights key concepts and vocabulary that students learn across one or more lessons in the unit. The content of these video lesson summaries is based on the written Lesson Summaries found at the end of lessons in the curriculum. The goal of these videos is to support students in reviewing and checking their understanding of important concepts and vocabulary. Here are some possible ways families can use these videos:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>
    Keep informed on concepts and vocabulary students are learning about in class.
  </li>
  <li>
    Watch with their students and pause at key points to predict what comes next or think up other examples of vocabulary terms.
  </li>
