<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>Previously, students used area diagrams to expand expressions of the form \((x+p)(x+q)\) and generalized that the
  expanded expressions take the form of \(x^2+(p+q)x+pq\). In this lesson, they see that the same generalization can be
  applied when the factored expression contains a sum and a difference (when \(p\) or \(q\) is negative) or two
  differences (when both \(p\) and \(q\) are negative).</p>
<p>Although they have encountered an algebraic approach, students still benefit from drawing diagrams to expand
  unfamiliar factored expressions. Area diagrams are intuitive for visualizing the product of two sums, but they are
  less intuitive for visualizing the product of two differences (for example, \((x-5)^2\)) or of a sum and a difference
  (for example, \((x+3)(x-4)\)). Subtraction can be represented by removing parts of a rectangle and finding the area of
  the remaining region, but this strategy can get complicated when both factors are differences.</p>
<p>At this point, students transition from thinking about rectangular diagrams concretely, in terms of area, to thinking
  about them more abstractly, as a way to organize the terms in each factor. (Students made similar transitions from
  area diagrams to abstract diagrams in middle school, for example, when they learned to distribute the multiplication
  of a number or a variable-positive and negative-over addition and subtraction.)</p>
<p>Students also learn to use the terms standard form and factored form. When classifying quadratic expressions by their
  form, students refine their language and thinking about quadratic expressions. In an upcoming lesson, students will
  graph quadratic expressions of these forms and study how features of the graphs relate to the parts of the
  expressions.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Comprehend the terms &ldquo;standard form&rdquo; and &ldquo;factored form&rdquo; (in written and spoken
    language). </li>
  <li> Use rectangular diagrams to reason about the product of two differences or of a sum and difference and to write
    equivalent expressions. </li>
  <li> Use the distributive property to write quadratic expressions given in factored form in standard form. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Rewrite quadratic expressions given in factored form in standard form using either the distributive property or a
    diagram. </li>
  <li> Know the difference between &ldquo;factored form&rdquo; and &ldquo;standard form.&rdquo; </li>
</ul>

    <p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are
  only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.
  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p>
