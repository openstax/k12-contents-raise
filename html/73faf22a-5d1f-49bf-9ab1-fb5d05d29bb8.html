<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
  <p>Previously, students have studied the structure of equations concretely and contextually. In this activity, they
    shift to reasoning symbolically and abstractly about linear equations in two variables.</p>
  <p>Students are prompted to match equations in standard forms to pairs of slopes and  \( y \) -intercepts. They could go about making the matches in various ways. Here
    are a few likely strategies, from less reliant on structure to more reliant on structure:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Substituting the coordinates of the given  \( y \) -intercepts into each
      equation and seeing which one produces true equations.</li>
    <li>Calculating the  \( y \) -values when  \(x \)  is 0 and  \( x \)  is 1. The former gives the \( y \) -intercept. Subtracting the latter from the former gives the slope.
    </li>
    <li>Graphing each equation (either by hand or using technology) and analyzing the graph.</li>
    <li>Rearranging the equation into slope-intercept form,  \( y=mx+b \) , and
      identifying the  \( m \)  and  \( b\) .</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Others may notice that when isolating \(y\) in an equation in standard form, the constant term in the resulting
    equation is \( \frac{c}{b} \) and the coefficient of \( x \) is \( \frac{-A}{B} \), and that these values tell
    them the vertical intercept and the slope. In addition to making use of structure, students who make and apply these
    observations also practice expressing regularity through repeated reasoning.</p>
  <p>Making graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically.</p>
  <p>As students work, monitor the strategies they use. Encourage those who approach the task by substituting values
    into the equations to consider rearranging equations or otherwise using the structure of the equations.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>

<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>For numbers 1-2, use the equations below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>These are the equations from the activity. Each equation is in the form \(Ax+By=C\)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>\( 4x - 3y = -3 \)<br>
  \( 12x - 4y = 8 \)<br>
  \( 8x + 2y = 16 \)<br>
  \( 3x - y = -1\)<br>
  \( 4x - 3y = 6 \)
</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li>For each equation, graph the equation and, on the same coordinate plane, graph the line passing through \((0,0)\) and (A,B). For example, graph the first equation −4x+3y=3 and also the line through \((0,0)\) and \((−4,3)\). Then graph the other equations and the points \((0, 0)\) and \((A, B)\) the same way. Pay attention to any patterns in the graphs.
Use the graphing tool or technology outside the course. Graph the equation that represents this scenario using the Desmos tool below. 
</li> 
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong> The two lines are  perpendicular.</p>
<p>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. <br>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> The two lines are always perpendicular.</p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
  <p>Students will likely use the strategy of rewriting the equations in slope-intercept form. Common mistakes here
    include isolating  \( x \)  rather than  \( y
      \) , changing the sign of only one term when dividing by a negative number, and dividing only one of two
    terms by the coefficient of  \( y \) . (For these last two mistakes, remind
    students of the work in the Warm-up.)</p>
  <p>Students who recognize that the slope of a line with equation  \( Ax+By=C \) 
    is  \( \frac{- A}{B} \)  and that the  \( y
      \) -intercept is  \( \frac{C}{B} \)  may also write the wrong
    signs or get a ratio reversed. Students who use this strategy are likely shortcutting the process of isolating  \( y \) . Asking them to isolate  \( y \) 
    for one equation can help them identify errors.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>

  <p>Select students to present their strategies. Sequence the order of presentation as listed in the Activity
    Narrative. After each strategy is presented, ask if other students approached it the same way and consider
    discussing questions such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&ldquo;How would you describe the matching process or the strategy? Was it fairly efficient or laborious? Was it
      prone to errors?&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;If the list of slopes and  \( y \) -intercepts were not available
      for you to choose from, would you still be able to determine the slope and  \( y
        \) -intercept?&rdquo; (Yes, except those who rely on the first strategy, using the coordinate values of
      each  \( y \) -intercept on the list to test the equations.)</li>
    <li>(For students who use graphing technology) &ldquo;Would you still use graphs to make the matches if the graphing
      needed to be done by hand?&rdquo;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Highlight that it is helpful and efficient to use the structure of an equation to get insights about the properties
    of its graph. At this stage, it is not essential that students recognize that the slope of an equation of the form
     \( Ax+By=C \)  is  \( \frac{- A}{B} \) 
    and that it crosses the  \( y \) -axis at  \(
      \frac{C}{B} \) . Students should, however, recognize that solving for  \( y
      \)  involves a predictable process and the resulting equation makes the slope and  \( y \) -intercept visible</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong> -15</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
<li>Explain your reasoning. <br>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p> 
<p><strong>Strategy 1: Solve for \(y\).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Subtract the \(x\) term from both sides.<br>
  Subtract \(5\) from both sides.<br>
  \(5x - 5x - y =15 -5x\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 </strong>- Simplify.<br>
\(- y =15 -5x\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Divide both sides by the coefficient of \(y\).<br>
  Divide both sides by \(-1\).<br>
\(\frac{-y}{-1}=\frac{15\ -5x}{-1}\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Simplify.<br>
  \(y = 5x -15\)<br>
  The slope is the coefficient of \(x\), so the slope is 5. The \(y\)-intercept is the constant, which is −15.<br><br>
<strong>Strategy 2: Use standard form. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Identify A, B, and C.<br>
  In \( 5x - y =15 \), \( A=5 \), \( B = -1 \), \( C =15 \).<br>
  Slope: \( -\frac{A}{B}=-\frac{5}{-1}=5 \)<br>
  \( y \)-intercept: \( \frac{C}{B}=\frac{15}{-1}=-15 \)
</p>
