<h4>Student Activity </h4>

<ol>
<li> Write an equation to represent the relationship between the step number and the number of squares in the pattern. Briefly describe how each part of the equation relates to the pattern. </li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(y=n^2+n\) or equivalent because there is an \(n\)-by-\(n\) array of small squares, which gives \(n^2\), and then there is a row of \(n\) squares in the lower right.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li> Is the relationship between the step number and number of squares a quadratic function? Explain how you know. </li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution </strong>button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The relationship is a quadratic function because the number of squares could be expressed as \(n^2+n\), which is a quadratic expression.</p>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>Points to Emphasize</h5>
<p>Emphasize the idea that in a pattern of shapes, the step number is the input. Use student examples or a think-aloud to show strategies for writing expressions for a visual pattern.</p>
