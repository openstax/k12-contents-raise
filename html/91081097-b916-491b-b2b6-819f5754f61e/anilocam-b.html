<p>In this lesson, you
  will continue to develop your understanding of
  solving systems by elimination. You will be given a system that represents the
  quantities and constraints in a situation and learn to interpret, in context,
  the solutions to the individual equations and to the system. Ultimately, the
  context will be used to make sense of the sum of the two equations and why it
  shares a solution with the equations in the given system. </p>
<p>Below are the knowledge and skills you will practice in this lesson. Before you begin, read each one and rate how much you currently know about each one. It&rsquo;s okay if your ratings are low; the purpose of this is to check in with yourself about what you do or do not yet know.</p>
<p><strong>Can you...</strong></p>
