<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>Solve each equation by rewriting it in factored form and using the zero product property. Be prepared to explain your reasoning.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>\(x^2+ 12x + 11 = 0\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=-1\) and \(x=-11\)<br>
  The equation \(x^2 + 12x + 11 = 0\) can be written as \((x + 11)(x + 1) = 0\), which means \(x + 11 = 0\) or \(x + 1 = 0\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>\(x^2&minus; 3 = 1\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=-2\) and \(x=2\)<br>
  The equation \(x^2&minus; 3 = 1\) can be written as \(x^2 &minus; 4 = 0\), which is \((x + 2)(x &minus; 2) = 0\), which means \(x + 2 = 0\) or \(x &minus; 2 = 0\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>\(x^2&minus; 6x + 7 = -2\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=3\)<br>
  The equation \(x^2&minus; 6x + 7 = -2\) can be written as \(x^2&minus; 6x + 9 = 0\), which is \((x &minus; 3)(x &minus; 3) = 0\), which means \(x &minus; 3 = 0\).</p>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>Press Pause</h5>
<p>If students are still making substantial errors with factoring, spend some time reviewing student work from cool downs and providing additional practice opportunities through practice problems.</p>
