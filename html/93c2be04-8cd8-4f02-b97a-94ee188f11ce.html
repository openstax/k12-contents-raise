<h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>
<p>In an earlier lesson, students learned that equivalent equations are equations with the same solution. They practiced
  identifying and writing equivalent equations by performing some acceptable moves. Students also recognized that, when
  solving one-variable equations, they are essentially writing a series of equivalent equations that lead to the
  solution.</p>
<p>This lesson serves two main goals. The first goal is to further develop the idea of equivalent equations. Students
  think about and articulate how they know that the equations produced using acceptable moves are indeed equivalent. The
  process is an opportunity to practice constructing logical arguments and critiquing the reasoning of others.</p>
<p>The second goal is to refamiliarize students with equations with no solutions (which they encountered in grade 8) and
  with a move that might appear acceptable (dividing each side of an equation by the same variable expression) but
  would, in fact, lead us to the wrong conclusion.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explain (orally and in writing) why performing certain operations on an equation may create equivalent equations
    but performing other operations may not.</li>
  <li>Illustrate that dividing by a variable is not used in solving equations because it can lead to equations that have
    fewer solutions than the original equation.</li>
  <li>Demonstrate that equations that are not true for any value of the variable(s) do not have solutions.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Explain why some algebraic moves create equivalent equations but some do not.</li>
  <li>Describe how equivalent equations are related to the steps of solving equations.</li>
  <li>Explain what it means for an equation to have no solutions and recognize such an equation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners
</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A1(E) internalize new basic and academic language by using and reusing it in meaningful ways in speaking and writing activities that build concept and language attainment 
  </li>
  <li>A1(G) demonstrate an increasing ability to distinguish between formal and informal English and an increasing knowledge of when to use each one commensurate with grade-level learning expectations
  </li>
  <li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment 
  </li>
  <li>A2(G) understand the general meaning, main points, and important details of spoken language ranging from situations in which topics, language, and contexts are familiar to unfamiliar 
  </li>
  <li>A2(H) understand implicit ideas and information in increasingly complex spoken language commensurate with grade-level learning expectations
  </li>
  <li>A3(B) expand and internalize initial English vocabulary by learning and using high-frequency English words necessary for identifying and describing people, places, and objects, by retelling simple stories and basic information represented or supported by pictures, and by learning and using routine language needed for classroom communication
  </li>
  <li>A3(G) express opinions, ideas, and feelings ranging from communicating single words and short phrases to participating in extended discussions on a variety of social and grade-appropriate academic topics
  </li>
</ul>
