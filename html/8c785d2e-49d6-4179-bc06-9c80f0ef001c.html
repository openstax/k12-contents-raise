<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>Previously, students were given quadratic expressions in vertex form and asked to visualize the location of the vertex and the direction of the opening of the graph representing each expression. In this lesson, they reason the other way around and think about what expressions would produce graphs with particular vertices. Students look more closely at how changing the \(h\) and the \(k\) in a quadratic expression of the form \(a(x&minus;h)^2+k\) translates the graph, and recall that the coefficient \(a\) affects the direction of the opening of a parabola.</p>
<p>Students continue to reason abstractly with expressions and graphs, but in one of the activities they also reconnect abstract expressions and quantities to a context. They continue to consolidate the ideas, structure, and generalizations from the past few lessons and apply them in new ways.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Create a quadratic function by changing the vertex of an existing function given its equation, graph, and a description. </li>
  <li> Describe informally (orally and in writing) the effect on the graph of a quadratic function when performing simple algebraic transformations. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Describe how changing a number in the vertex form of a quadratic function affects its graph. </li>
</ul>

<h4> Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<div>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS.  The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.<br>&nbsp;<br>
	<ul>
	<li>ELPS 1(E) internalize new basic and academic language by using and reusing it in meaningful ways in speaking and writing activities that build concept and language attainment</li>
	<li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
	<li>ELPS 3(B) expand and internalize initial English vocabulary by learning and using high-frequency English words necessary for identifying and describing people, places, and objects, by retelling simple stories and basic information represented or supported by pictures, and by learning and using routine language needed for classroom communication</li>
	<li>ELPS 3(D) speak using grade-level content area vocabulary in context to internalize new English words and build academic language proficiency</li>
	<li>ELPS 3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions</li>
	</ul>
