<p>Ask students to examine the graphs and use them to help summarize what graphs can tell us about the domain and range of functions. Ask students to complete the following prompts as thoroughly as they can.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I can learn about the domain and range of a function from a graph by looking for . . .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A graph may not always show all that is needed to fully describe the domain and range, however. For example, it may not show . . .</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the day’s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
