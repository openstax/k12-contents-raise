<p>Ask students to examine the graphs and use them to help summarize what graphs can tell us about the domain and range of functions. Ask students to complete the following prompts as thoroughly as they can.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I can learn about the domain and range of a function from a graph by looking for . . .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A graph may not always show all that is needed to fully describe the domain and range, however. For example, it may not show . . .</p>
