<h4>Answering Questions About Situations With the Quadratic Formula</h4>
<p>Here is an example of someone solving a <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="&ldquo;1.0&rdquo;" data-store="glossary-tooltip">quadratic equation</span> that has no solutions:</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  \((x+3)^2+9=0\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  \((x+3)^2=-9\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  \(x+3=\pm \sqrt{-9}\)</p>
<p>Study the example. At what point did you realize the equation had no solutions?</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> For two numbers to add up to 0, they have to be opposites. Since the number 9 is positive, the other number must be negative, which a square cannot be. </li>
</ul>
<p>Explain how you know the equation \(49+x^2=0\) has no solutions.</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> A square is always positive, so a square plus a positive number must also be positive and can never equal zero. </li>
</ul>

  <p>Here is how to solve this word problem using the <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="&ldquo;1.0&rdquo;" data-store="glossary-tooltip">quadratic formula</span>:</p>
  <p>To know how much time it would take the object to reach 15 meters, we could solve the equation \(15=-5t^2+25t\).</p>
  <ul class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li> Rewriting it in standard form gives \(-5t^2+25t-15=0\). The expression on the left side of the equation cannot be written in factored form, however. </li>
    <li> Completing the square isn't convenient because the coefficient of the squared term is not a perfect square and the coefficient for the linear term is an odd number. </li>
    <li> Let's use the quadratic formula, using \(a=-5\), \(b=25\), and \(c = -15\)! </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Step 1<br>
    \(t=\frac {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2- 4ac}}{2a}\)</p>
  <p>Step 2<br>
    \(t=\frac{-25 \pm \sqrt{25^2- 4(-5)(-15)}}{2(-5)}\)</p>
  <p>Step 3<br>
    \(t=\frac{-25 \pm \sqrt{325}}{-10}\)</p>
  <p>The expression \(\frac{-25 \pm \sqrt{325}}{-10}\) represents the two exact solutions of the equation.</p>
  <p>We can get approximate solutions by using a calculator, or by reasoning the \(\sqrt{325} \approx 18\).</p>
  <p>The solutions tell us that there are two times after the launch when the object is at a height of 15 meters: at about 0.7 seconds (as the object is going up) and 4.3 seconds (as it comes back down).</p>
