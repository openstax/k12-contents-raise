  <p>It is natural to forget things, which is why it’s important to practice drawing information out of memory: the more you practice this, the better you’ll be able to do on your tests! </p>
</div>

<p>Here is a diagram that shows the picture with a frame that is the same width all the way around.</p>
<p>The picture is 7 inches by 4 inches. The frame is created from 10 square inches of framing material (in the form of a rectangle measuring 4 inches by 2.5 inches).</p>
