<p>In this lesson, students used exponential functions to answer questions about different situations. In a previous lesson, they saw that a function \(f\) defined by \(f(t)=240(\frac13)^t\) represents the area of algae in square yards after \(t\)<em>&nbsp;</em>weeks of treatment. Discuss how the equation could be used to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>produce a graph.</li>
  <li>find the area of the algae 6 weeks after treatment.</li>
  <li>find out when the area of the algae would drop below 10 square yards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask students what \(f(1)=80\) and \(f(2)=\frac{80}{3}\) mean in this context. To reiterate the importance of choosing an appropriate graphing window, ask students to give examples of a graphing window that would be appropriate (or inappropriate) for this function. Time permitting, demonstrate the outcomes of their suggestions using graphing technology.</p>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
