<h4> Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this culminating lesson, students use polynomials to model dimensions and areas of rectangles. Both activities in the lesson use the dimensions and areas of rectangles to apply the skills of working with polynomials learned throughout the unit. </p>
<p>In the first activity, students are given diagrams of rectangles with side lengths labeled. They complete a table to find the missing measures of length, width, or area. </p>
<p>In the second activity, students are given a table of measures of rectangles, similar to the table in the previous activity. In this activity, they will not have the visual of the rectangles. Also, they will be given the area of rectangles and asked to find the dimensions. This will require division of polynomials or factoring. </p>
<p>In the third activity, students create their own table with given measures. Each student trades tables with a partner and works to find the missing measures. Students check their answers with their partner. A discussion after the activity can include having students share the methods they used to create the table. </p>
<p>Students have an opportunity to apply the skills of working with polynomials as they add, multiply, divide, and factor polynomials to find the missing measures of rectangles.</p>
