<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity complements the previous one. Students first examine what happens to the values of an exponential function \(f\) when the input is increased by 1. If \(f\) is an exponential function defined by \(f(x)=a \cdot b^x\), then its value changes by a factor of \(b\). Similarly, if the input is increased by 7, then the function value increases by a factor of \(b^7\). More generally, an exponential function always changes by equal factors over equal intervals.</p>
<p>Students may have little trouble recognizing how the output values change when dealing with numerical input values, but they may find it challenging to generalize their observations. Focus the discussion on this transition and on using properties of exponents to extend their observations toward generalized cases.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here is a table that shows some input and output values of an exponential function \(g\). The equation \(g(x)=3^x\) defines the function.</p>

<li> How does \(g(x)\) change every time \(x\) increases by 1? Show or explain your reasoning.<br>
<br>
<strong>Answer: </strong> The output values increase by a factor of 3. For example: When we divide two consecutive output values, the quotient is always 3.
  </li><br>
<li> Choose two new input values that are consecutive whole numbers and find their output values. Record them in the table. How do the output values change for those two input values?<br>
<br>
<strong>Answer: </strong> \(g(10)=3^{10}\) and \(g(11)=3^{11}\). The output still grows by a factor of 3 when the input increases by 1 (from 10 to 11).

<li>Look at the change in output values as the \(x\)&nbsp;increases by 1. Does it still agree with your earlier findings? Show your reasoning.<br>

<strong>Answer: </strong> Yes, the outputs still increase by a factor of 3. By rules of exponents, we know that \(3x \cdot 3=3^{x+1}\). (Or by rules of exponents, we know that \(\frac {3^{x+1}}{3^x}=3^{x+1-x}\), which equals 3.)

  Yes, the outputs still increase by a factor of 27. By rules of exponents, we know that \(3x \cdot 3^3=3^{x+3}\). (Or by rules of exponents, we know that \(\frac{3^{x+3}}{3^x}=3^{x+3-x}\), which equals \(3^3\) or 27.)

<h4>Student-Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>For integer inputs, we can think of multiplication as repeated addition and exponentiation as repeated multiplication:</p>
<p>\(3 \cdot 5=3+3+3+3+3\) and \(3^5=3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3\).</p>
<p>We could continue this process with a new operation called tetration. It uses the symbol \(\uparrow \uparrow\), and it is defined as repeated exponentiation:</p>
<p>\(3 \uparrow \uparrow 5=3^{3 \wedge 3 \wedge 3 \wedge 3}\).</p>
<p>Compute \(2 \uparrow \uparrow 3\) and \(3 \uparrow \uparrow 2\). If \(f(x)=3 \uparrow \uparrow x\), what is the relationship between \(f(x)\) and \(f(x+1)\)?</p>
<h4> Extension Student Response</h4>
<p>We have \(2 \uparrow \uparrow 3=2^{2 \wedge 2}=24=16\) and \(3 \uparrow \uparrow 2=3^3=27\).</p>
<p>The numbers output by this function get large absurdly fast, even in comparison to exponential functions. We calculated \(f(2)=27\) above, and now \(f(3)=3^{f(2)}=3^{27}=7,625,597,484,987\).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share what they noticed about values of \(g\) for consecutive whole numbers. If not mentioned by students, point out the pattern that as the \(x\)-value increases by 1, the output changes by a factor of 3. For example: \(g(5)\) is 3 times \(g(4)\), \(g(8)\) is 3 times \(g(7)\), and so on.</p>
<p>Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;What do we have when dividing the outputs for two consecutive \(x\)-values, such as \(\frac{g(5)}{g(4)}\) or \(\frac{g(8)}{g(7)}\)?&rdquo; (a quotient of 3) </li>
<li>&ldquo;How are the two outputs \(g(x+1)\) and \(g(x)\) related, then? (\(g(x+1)\) is \(g(x)\) times 3, or when we divide \(g(x+1)\) by \(g(x)\), the quotient is 3.) </li>
<li>&ldquo;How can we use the rules of exponents to show that this is always the case?&rdquo; \((g(x)=3^x\), so \(g(x+1)=3^{x+1}\). When dividing two powers with the same bases, we can subtract the exponents. Dividing the two, we have \(\frac{3^{x+1}}{3^x}\), which is 3.) </li>
<li>&ldquo;Does this reasoning work if the function has a different initial value, say \(h\) given by \(h(x)=5 \cdot 3^x\)?&rdquo; (Yes, \(\frac{5 \cdot 3^{x+1}}{5 \cdot 3^x}\) still equals 3.) </li>
<li>&ldquo;What happens to the output of \(g\) when \(x\) increases by 2?&rdquo; (\(g(x)\) increases by a factor of 3 twice, or \(3^2\).) &ldquo;What about when it increases by 5?&rdquo; (\(g(x)\) increases by a factor of 3 five times.) </li>
<li>&ldquo;What happens to the output when \(x\) increases by \(a\)?&rdquo; (\(g(x)\) increases by a factor of 3 \(a\) times, or \(3^a\). The rule of exponents can help us here as well. If we divide \(g(x+a)\) by \(g(x)\), we have: \(\frac {3^{x+a}}{3^x}=3^a\).) </li>
</ul>
<p>Consider using a graph of \(g\) to help students visualize growth of \(g\) over equal intervals of \(x\). The successive quotients of the outputs are always 3.</p>

<h4> Determining the Growth Rate of Exponential Functions</h4>
<p>For the table below, assume the function \(f\) is defined for all real numbers. Calculate \(\triangle f = (x+1)&minus;f(x)\) in the last column. (The symbol \(\triangle\) in this context means &ldquo;change in.&rdquo;) What do you notice about \(\triangle f\)? Could the function be linear or exponential?

<p>For each row, you subtract \(f(x)\) values. The first row would be \(6- 2 =4\), then \(18 - 6 =12\), then \(54 - 18 =36\), and then \(162 - 54 = 108\). Since the rate of change isn&rsquo;t consistent, it is not a linear function.&nbsp; Exponential functions have a growth factor or a repeated rate that the terms are being multiplied by. If you divide consecutive terms, you will find the growth rate is 3. Notice that the change between consecutive terms also has a growth rate of 3.</p>
<p>Since this function is exponential, an equation will have the form \(f(x) = initial \;\ value \;\ (growth \;\ rate)^x\). The growth rate is 3. The initial value is the same as the \(y\)-intercept, or where \(x=0\). \(f(0)\) is given in the table, so the initial value is 2. The equation for this table would be \(f(x) = 2(3)^x\).</p>
<h4>Try It: Determining the Growth Rate of Exponential Functions</h4>

<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to check your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to write the equation of an exponential function from a graph:</p>
<p>The graph seems to be exponential. If you find the rate of change between consecutive points, you find the graph is exponential and the rate of change is 2 since the \(y\)-values increase by a factor of 2 every time the \(x\)-values increase by 1. Since the graph crosses the \(y\)-axis at \((0,1)\), that is the initial value. The equation for this graph is \(f(x) = 2^x\).</p>
