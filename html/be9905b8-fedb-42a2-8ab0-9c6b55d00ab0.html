                <li>How does self-care benefit relationships?
                </li>

            <p>Take a moment to assess the health of your relationships. Who are the people who make you smile, who boost your confidence, who truly listen when you need to talk, and who want only the best for you? Investing in these relationships is likely to make you happier and healthier. Relationships are two-way streets. How committed are you to your relationships? How much effort do you put into nurturing your relationships?
            </p>
            <p>How confident are you in building relationships and working with others in school? Take this quick survey to figure it out, ranking questions on a scale of 1—4, 1 meaning “least like me” and 4 meaning “most like me.” These questions will help you determine how these concepts relate to you right now. As you are introduced to new concepts and practices, it can be informative to reflect on how your understanding changes over time.

            <p>Research has shown that friends provide a sense of meaning or purpose in our lives, and that having a healthy social life is important to staying physically healthy. In a meta-analysis of the research results from 148 studies of over 300,000 participants, researchers found that social relationships are important in improving our lifespan. Social support has been linked to lower blood pressure and better immune system functioning. The meta-analysis also showed that social support operates on a continuum: the greater the extent of the relationships, the lower the health risks.<a href="https://openstax.org/books/preparing-for-college-success/pages/6-1-the-benefits-of-healthy-relationships#ch11rfin-27" target="_blank">1</a>

            <p><strong>Questions to Consider:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>What are the benefits of working in groups?
                </li>

            <p>Working in groups on projects and assignments often gets a bad rap, because it sometimes can lead to an unequal distribution of labor. However, with proper planning, group work actually supports individual success, as much as that of the group. 
            </p>

            <p class="os-raise-indent"><strong>Enhanced Learning</strong></p>
            <p class="os-raise-indent">Group work provides opportunities for participants to share knowledge and ideas. Through collaboration and discussion with partners, you can deepen your own understanding of a topic. </p>
            <p class="os-raise-indent"><strong>Improved Problem-Solving Skills</strong></p>
            <p class="os-raise-indent">Working in groups allows students to pool diverse skills and experiences to tackle complex problems and challenges. By brainstorming ideas, analyzing options, and evaluating solutions together, groups can arrive at more creative and effective solutions.</p>
            <p class="os-raise-indent"><strong>Preparation for Real-World Collaboration</strong></p>
            <p class="os-raise-indent">Group work promotes essential skills such as communication, teamwork, leadership and conflict resolution. When working in a group, you can practice clear communication, active listening, negotiation and shared responsibilities. These are all extremely valuable workforce skills in addition to their value in the classroom.</p>
        
            <p>Conflict during group work does not have to be inevitable. With proper planning, clear roles and responsibilities, and a communication plan, your group can minimize a majority of issues that can arise.

            <h4>Conflict Resolution and Mediation</h4>
            <p>Conflict is a natural part of relationships, but learning how to resolve conflicts constructively is crucial to maintaining healthy connections. By developing these skills, you’ll be better equipped to navigate conflicts effectively, build stronger connections with others, and create a more inclusive and vibrant community. 
            </p>
            <p><strong>Conflict Resolution Skills</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Active Listening</strong>- Active listening involves giving your whole attention to the speaker, making eye contact, and using nonverbal communication (such as nodding your head) to indicate you are listening. Sometimes we get so focused on how we want to respond, we’re not able to fully concentrate on what someone else is saying. Understanding someone else’s perspective starts with listening.</li>
                <li><strong>Use “I” Statements</strong>- When expressing how you feel, avoid accusatory statements or blaming language. For example, say, “I feel frustrated when doing group projects because I’m unclear about individual assignments” instead of “Group projects suck, because everyone else is lazy. No one else does any work.”</li>
                <li><strong>Brainstorm Solutions Together</strong>- Collaborate with the other person to brainstorm solutions to the conflict. Focus on finding “win-win” solutions that address each of your needs and interests. </li>
                <li><strong>Take a “time out”</strong>- If emotions escalate during a conflict, take a break to cool off. Reflect on why you may feel tense or upset. Step away from the situation to regain composure before continuing the discussion. </li>
                <li><strong>Focus on the Future</strong>- Instead of dwelling on past grievances, focus on finding a solution that moves the relationship forward. Place your focus on moving forward rather than trying to find fault.</li>
                <li><strong>Practice Empathy</strong>- Put yourself in the other person’s shoes and try to understand their perspective. Reflect on all the things about your life that they don’t know; they have their own experiences that you may be totally unaware of. Try to practice kindness and take the high road. </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Opportunities for Practice</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Reflect on a recent conflict you experienced, and identify which conflict resolution skills you used (or could have used) to address the situation more effectively. Write down your reflections and discuss them with a peer or mentor.
                </li>
                <li>Engage in a perspective-taking activity with a friend or family member. Take turns sharing your experiences, perspectives, and feelings about a specific topic or issue. Actively listen to each other without judgment.
                </li>
                <li>Perform an act of kindness for someone in your community. This could be as simple as offering a respectful compliment, lending a helping hand, or expressing gratitude for their presence in your life. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Reflection Questions
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>How did practicing empathy and conflict resolution skills impact your relationships and interactions with others?
                </li>
                <li>What steps can you take to promote positivity, empathy, and understanding in your school or community?
