<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm up activity introduces the idea of reversing the FOIL process to factor a trinomial back into its factored form.</p>
<h4> Launch</h4>
<p>Introduce the first activity by identifying the trinomial \(q^2 + 10q + 24\). Allow 2&ndash;3 minutes for students to write down their answers, completing the table. Once they have finished, review the solution to ensure their table is correct. Emphasize that we are looking for the factors that multiply to 24 and have a sum of 10. Once students identify the correct factors, display the factored expression.</p>
<p>As a check, use FOIL to multiply the expression the students just found. This will demonstrate why they were searching for factors that multiplied to 24 and added to 10.</p>
<h4> Student Activity</h4>
<p>We are going to factor the trinomial \(q^2 + 10q + 24\) by reversing the process of FOIL.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to look at these factors to see which of them would fit in the boxes and multiply to make the trinomial \(q^2 + 10q + 24\) that we started with in the beginning.</p>
<p>\((q+\square)(q+\square)\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Which pair of factors fits the situation? What is the factored expression?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(4\), \(6\); \((q + 4)(q + 6)\)</p>
<p>So, by undoing FOIL, we found that the trinomial \(q^2 + 10q + 24\) factors to the expression \((q + 4)(q + 6)\).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>The FOIL process is a way of multiplying two binomials. By thinking about reversing this process, students can start to see how a trinomial might be rewritten into its factored form.</p>
