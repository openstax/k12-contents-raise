<h4>Modeling Situations Using Direct Variation&nbsp;</h4>
<p>When two quantities are related by a proportion, we say they are proportional to each other. Another way to express this relation is to talk about the variation of the two quantities. We will discuss direct variation here.</p>
<p>Lindsay gets paid $15 per hour at her job. If we let s be her salary, in dollars per hour, and h be the number of hours she has worked, we could model this situation with the equation</p>
<p>\( s=15h \)</p>
<p>Lindsay&rsquo;s salary is the product of a constant, 15, and the number of hours she works. We say that Lindsay&rsquo;s salary varies directly with the number of hours she works. Two variables vary directly if one is the product of a constant and the other.</p>

  <p><strong>Direct Variation</strong></p>
  <p>For any two variables \( x \) and \( y \), y varies directly with \( x \) if&nbsp;</p>
  <p>\( y=kx \), where \( k&ne;0 \)</p>
  <p>The constant \( k \) is called the constant of variation.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>In applications using direct variation, generally we will know values of one pair of the variables and will be asked to find the equation that relates \( x \) and \( y \).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how to model an equation using direct variation for application problems.<br>
</p>
<br>
<div class="os-raise-graybox">
  <p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Write the formula for direct variation.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Substitute the given values for the variables.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3 </strong>- Solve for the constant of variation.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4 </strong>- Write the equation that relates \(x\) and \(y\) using the constant of variation.<br>
  </p>
</div>
<br>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an application problem:</p>
<p>The cost of a pizza, \( y \), varies directly with its diameter, \( x \), and an 8-inch pizza costs $12. What is the equation that relates \( x \) and \( y \)?</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Write the formula for direct variation.<br>
  \( y = kx \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Substitute the given values for the variables.<br>
  \( 12 = k(8) \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 </strong>- Solve for the constant of variation.<br>
  \( k= \frac{12}{8}= \frac{3}{2} \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 </strong>- Write the equation that relates x and y using the constant of variation.<br>
  \(y = \frac32 x \)<br>
