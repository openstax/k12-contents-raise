<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Create drawings, tables, and graphs that represent the area of a garden. </li>
  <li> Recognize a situation represented by a graph that increases and then decreases. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 7.1.1: Noticing New Patterns of Change </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you determined patterns in tables based on how the \(y\)-values changed as the \(x\)-values changed. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 7.1.2: The Relationship Between Length and Area </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you examined different combinations of lengths and widths of a rectangle and their respective areas given an amount of fencing. You realized that the closer the rectangle was to a square, the larger the area. </li>
    <li> 7.1.2: Self Check </li>
    <li> 7.1.2: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 7.1.3: Plotting Measurements </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you looked at how a function that wasn&rsquo;t linear or exponential changed by increasing and then decreasing.</li>
    <li> 7.1.3: Self Check </li>
    <li> 7.1.3: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 7.1.4: The Input and Output of a Function </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you completed a table where values again increased and then decreased, rather than always increasing or always decreasing like in linear and exponential functions. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following<strong> practice</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 7.1.5: Practice </li>
</ul>
