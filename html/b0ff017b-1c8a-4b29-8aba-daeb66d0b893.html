<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students multiply expressions of the form \((x + m)\) and \((x - m)\). They discover that the expanded product of such factors can be expressed as a difference of two square numbers: \(x^2- m^2\). Students use diagrams and the distributive property to make sense of their observations.</p>
<p>In the last question, they have an opportunity to notice that an expression in the form \((x + m)^2\) is not equivalent to \(x^2+ m^2\), to discourage overgeneralizing. Later in the lesson, they will transform quadratic expressions in standard form into factored form and vice versa.</p>
<p>To answer the first two questions, some students may simply evaluate the expressions rather than reasoning about their structure. For example, to see if \((10 + 3)(10 - 3)\) is equivalent to \(10^2- 3^2\), they may calculate \(13 \cdot 7\) and \(100 - 9\) and see that both are 91. Ask students to see if they could show that this is not a coincidence. Could they show, for example, that \((50 + 4)(50 - 4)\) would also be equivalent to \(50^2-4^2\)?</p>
<p>As students work, look for those who expand the factored expression using the distributive property and leave the partial products unevaluated to show the equivalence of the two expressions.</p>

<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Extending Your Thinking</h5>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Explain how your work in the previous questions can help you mentally evaluate \(22 \cdot 18\).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(22 \cdot 18\) can be written as \((20 + 2)(20 - 2)\), which is equivalent to \(202 - 22\), which is \(400 - 4\), or 396.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Explain how your work in the previous questions can help you mentally evaluate \(45 \cdot 35\).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(45 \cdot 35\) can be written as \((40 + 5)(40 - 5)\), which is equivalent to \(40^2-5^2\), which is \(1600 - 25\), or 1575.</p>
<p>Here is a shortcut that can be used to mentally square any two-digit number. Let's take \(83^2\), for example.</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> 83 is \(80 + 3\). </li>
  <li> Compute \(80^2\) and \(3^2\), which gives 6400 and 9. Add these values to get 6409. </li>
  <li> Compute \(80 \cdot 3\), which is 240. Double it to get 480. </li>
  <li> Add 6409 and 480 to get 6889. </li>
</ul>
<p>Try using this method to find the squares of some other two-digit numbers. (With some practice, it is possible to get really fast at this!)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Explain why this method works.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Any two-digit number can be written as \(a + b\), where \(a\) is 10 times the first digit and \(b\) is the second digit. We are interested in squaring \(a + b\):</p>
<p>\((a + b)^2=(a + b)(a + b)\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(= a^2+ab +ab +b^2\) by the distributive property</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(= a^2+ 2ab +b^2\) by combining like terms</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(= a^2+b^2+2ab\) because addition is commutative</p>
<br>
<p>We get the \(a^2 + b^2\) from squaring \(a\) and \(b\) and adding them, and the \(2ab\) from multiplying the two values and doubling them.</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may struggle to generalize the pattern after just a few examples. Before starting the activity synthesis, provide additional factored expressions for students to expand, for instance: \((x + 3)(x - 3)\), \((2x + 1)(2x - 1)\), \((4x + 5)(4x - 5)\), and \((6 - x)(6 + x)\).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>To help students generalize their observations, display the expression \((x + m)(x - m)\) and a blank diagram that can be used to visualize the expansion of the factors. Ask students what expressions go in each rectangle.</p>

<br>
<p>Illustrate that when the terms in each factor are multiplied out, the resulting expression has two squares, one with a positive coefficient and the other with a negative coefficient (\(x^2\) and \(m^2\)) and two linear terms that are opposites (\(mx\) and \(-mx\)). Because the sum of \(mx\) and \(-mx\) is 0, what remains is the difference of \(x^2\) and \(m^2\), or \(x^2 - m^2\). There is now no linear term.</p>
<p>Emphasize that knowing this allows us to rewrite into factored form any quadratic expression that has no linear term and that is a difference of a squared variable and a squared constant. For example, we can write \(x^2-9\) as \((x + 3)(x - 3)\) because we know that when the latter is expanded, the result is \(x^2-9\).</p>
<p>Use the last question to point out the importance of paying attention to the structure of these expressions (the subtraction in the first expression, the presence of both addition and subtraction in the second). For example, we can't use any patterns observed in this activity to rewrite \(x^2+9\) in factored form.</p>

<h4>Recognizing the Expanded Product of the Difference of Two Squares</h4>
<p>Mathematically, something special happens when two binomials that are conjugates are multiplied. In other words, the product of an expression of the form (\(a - b)(a + b)\) results in a unique expression called a difference of two squares. Here are some examples of these special products.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Let's look at the expression \((12 + 5)(12 - 5)\). We want to determine if it is equivalent to \(12^2-5^2\).</p>
<p>We can use the distributive property of multiplication over addition, or FOIL process, to multiply.</p>
<p>\((12 + 5)(12 - 5)\) <br><br>
  \(\begin{array}{rcl} &amp;=&amp;12^2-12\left(5\right)+5\left(12\right)-5^2\\&amp;&amp;\\&amp;=&amp;12^2-60+60-5^2\\&amp;&amp;\\&amp;=&amp;12^2-5^2\\&amp;&amp;\end{array}\)<br>
  So, \((12 + 5)(12 - 5)\) is equivalent to \(12^2-5^2\).</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Let's look at a different example using a <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">variable</span>.</p>
<p>\((x + 7)(x - 7)\)</p>
<p>Is this equivalent to \(x^2-7^2\)?</p>
<p>\((x + 7)(x - 7)\)<br><br>

  \(\begin{array}{rcl} &amp;=&amp;x^2-7x+7x-7^2\\&amp;&amp;\\&amp;=&amp;x^2-7^2=x^2-49\\&amp;&amp;\end{array}\)<br>
  This can also be shown using a diagram.</p>

<p>You have studied this process earlier when you learned the difference of squares.</p>
<p>In this lesson, we will reverse this process to rewrite the <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="&ldquo;1.0&rdquo;" data-store="glossary-tooltip">standard form</span> of a <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="&ldquo;1.0&rdquo;" data-store="glossary-tooltip">quadratic expression</span> into its <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="&ldquo;1.0&rdquo;" data-store="glossary-tooltip">factored form</span>.</p>

It does not work for an expression such as \(x^2+25\). (In fact, there is no way to multiply two binomials that would result in this expression.)</p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>
<p>Is \((x + 5)^2\) equivalent to \(x^2+25\)?</p>
<p>Let's find the equivalent expression for \((x + 5)^2\) or \((x + 5)(x + 5)\).</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}\left(x+5\right)^2&amp;=&amp;\left(x+5\right)\left(x+5\right)\\&amp;&amp;\\&amp;=&amp;x^2+5x+5x+25\\&amp;&amp;\\&amp;=&amp;x^2+10x+25\\&amp;&amp;\end{array}\)<br>
  Since \(x^2+ 10x + 25\) is not equivalent to \(x^2+25\), these expressions are not the same.</p>
