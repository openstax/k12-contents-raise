<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>Before this lesson, students have considered (even if only peripherally) input and output values that would make
  sense in the context of a function. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li> When analyzing the cost of buying bagels, it was intuitive to consider only positive whole numbers for the input.
  </li>
  <li> When studying the total number of barks of a dog as a function of time, it was natural to consider only positive
    whole numbers for the output. </li>
  <li> When looking at the height of a projectile as a function of time, it made sense to limit the input from the
    launch of the object to the moment the object hits the ground. </li>
</ul>
<p>In this lesson and the next one, students focus their attention on possible input and output values, framing them as
  the domain and range of a function. In this lesson, they identify the domain and range of functions and describe them
  using words, lists of numbers, or inequalities (if appropriate). In the next lesson, students will relate the domain
  and range of a function with features of its graph.</p>
<p>Students&rsquo; analyses of inputs and outputs continue to be grounded in context, allowing many chances to reason
  quantitatively and abstractly. In an optional activity, there is an opportunity to study the domain of a function
  without a context.</p>
<p>The insights students gain here will help them later in the unit and throughout the course as they make sense of
  other kinds of functions: piecewise-defined, exponential, and quadratic. These understandings will also expand
  students&rsquo; capacity to model with mathematics.</p>
<h4> Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Given a description of a function that represents a situation, determine reasonable domain and range. </li>
  <li> Understand that the domain of a function is the set of all possible inputs and the range is the set of all
    possible outputs. </li>
</ul>
<h4> Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Describe the &ldquo;domain&rdquo; and &ldquo;range&rdquo; of a function. </li>
  <li> When given a description of a function in a situation, determine a reasonable domain and range for the function.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Required Preparation</h4>
<p>Graphing technology is required for the optional activity 4.11.4 "Using Graphs to Determine the Domain of a
  Function." Acquire devices that can run Desmos (recommended) or other graphing technology. It is ideal if each student
  has their own device. (Desmos is available under Math Tools.)</p>
<h4> Lesson Vocabulary</h4>
