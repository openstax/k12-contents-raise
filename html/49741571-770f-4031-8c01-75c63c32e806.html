<p>To help students consolidate the ideas in the lesson, discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li>"How does the zero product property help us find the solutions to \((x&minus;3)(x+4)=0\)?" (It tells us that either \(x&minus;3=0\) or \(x+4=0\), and each of these equations can be solved easily.) </li>
  <li>"Can you explain why the solutions to \((x&minus;3)(x+4)=8\) are not 3 and &ndash;4?" (The zero product property only works when the product of the factors is zero. When the product is any other number, we can&rsquo;t conclude that each factor is that number.) </li>
  <li>"The expression \(x^2&minus;x&minus;12\) is equivalent to (x+3)(x&minus;4). Can we apply the zero product property to solve \(x^2&minus;x&minus;12=0\)?" (Only if we rewrite the expression on the left in factored form first. We can&rsquo;t use the zero product property when the expression is not a product of factors.) </li>
  <li>"Can we solve \(x^2&minus;x &minus;12=0\) by performing the same operation to each side of the equation?" (No, doing that doesn&rsquo;t help us isolate the variable.) </li>
</ul>
