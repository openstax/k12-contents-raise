<p>The event, Punkin Chunkin, started off in a field in Delaware. The point of the event is to create a device with no motor that will throw a pumpkin as far as possible. Punkin Chunkin machines vary from catapults to complicated machines. In order to hit a target or maximize the distance a pumpkin goes, quadratic functions are used to graph, plan, and evaluate a pumpkin&rsquo;s trajectory or path.</p>
<p>You will recognize patterns that are represented by quadratic functions, rather than linear or exponential functions. As you proceed through this lesson, you will explore quadratic functions and their graphs. You will learn that a quadratic function can be written in standard, factored, or vertex form and each form provides a valuable way to identify key characteristics about quadratic graphs.</p>
