<p>Review the following key ideas about what to remember when solving quadratic equations and using the plus-minus sign.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Any positive number has two square roots, one positive and one negative, because there are two numbers that can be squared to make that number. (For example, \(6^2\) and \((-6)^2\) both equal 36, so 6 and -6 are both square roots of 36.) </li>
  <li> The square root symbol \((\sqrt{\;\;})\) can be used to express the positive square root of a number. For example, the square root of 36 is 6, but it can also be written as \(\sqrt{36}\) because \(\sqrt{36} \cdot \sqrt{36}=36\). </li>
  <li> To express the negative square root of a number, say 36, we can write -6 or \(- \sqrt{36}\). </li>
  <li> When a number is not a perfect square (for example, 40), we can express its square roots by writing \(\sqrt{40}\) and \(- \sqrt{40}\). </li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
