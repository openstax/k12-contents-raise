        <p>In this lesson, you will manipulate equations and solve for a variable. You will also begin to determine which forms of equations are more useful than others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Solve for a particular variable, given an equation.</li>
          <li>Determine the more useful form of an equation.</li>
          <li>Explain the phrase &ldquo;to solve for a variable.&rdquo;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
