<p>Invite students to reflect on how the relationship between the side lengths and the area of a rectangle differs from other relationships they&rsquo;ve seen. Consider asking students to comment on:</p>
<ul>
  <li> the values in the table relating the length and the area of the rectangle </li>
  <li> the graph representing the length&ndash;area relationship </li>
  <li> the rule that relates the input and output of the function </li>
</ul>
<p>It is not essential that students frame their observations in precise ways at this point. Their capacity to do so will be developed in the coming lessons.</p>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
