<p>Invite students to reflect on how the relationship between the side lengths and the area of a rectangle differs from other relationships they&rsquo;ve seen. Consider asking students to comment on:</p>
<ul>
  <li> the values in the table relating the length and the area of the rectangle </li>
  <li> the graph representing the length&ndash;area relationship </li>
  <li> the rule that relates the input and output of the function </li>
</ul>
<p>It is not essential that students frame their observations in precise ways at this point. Their capacity to do so will be developed in the coming lessons.</p>
