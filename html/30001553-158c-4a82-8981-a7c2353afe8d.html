<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity allows students to compare and contrast the two patterns visually and to make sense of the graphs and
  use them to answer questions in the context of the genie&rsquo;s offer. They recall that a quantity that grows by
  adding the same amount at each step forms a line when plotted, and they see an example where a quantity that grows by
  the same factor at each step forms a curve when plotted.</p>
<br>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Tell students they will now consider what the two offers look like graphically. One of the questions asks students
  about the vertical intercept. If needed, review the meaning of the term.</p>

  <p>Before revealing the task, begin by displaying only the graphs that show how the amount of money in the purses
    changes. Give students 1&ndash;2 minutes to write their own mathematical questions about the situation. Invite
    students to share their questions with the class. Listen for and amplify any questions seeking to determine which
    purse is the better choice or those that reference specific critical points on the graphs. This will build student
    understanding of the language of mathematical comparisons and help ensure students interpret the task correctly.</p>
</div>
<br>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here are graphs showing how the amount of money in each of the purses change. Remember, Purse A starts with $1,000
  and grows by $200 each day. Purse B starts with $0.01 and doubles each day.</p>
<p><img alt="Graph of an exponential function, origin O. number of days and amount in dollar."

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Which graph shows the amount of money in Purse A? Which graph shows the amount of money in Purse B? Explain how
    you know. <br><br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> The graph containing \(P\) is Purse B, and the graph containing \(Q\) is Purse A. Sample
    explanation: Purse B starts with less money than Purse A, so its graph will be lower at the beginning.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> Points \(P\) and \(Q\) are labeled on the graph. Explain what they mean in terms of the genie&rsquo;s offer.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> Point \(P\) says that 9 days after the genie has appeared, Purse B contains $5.12. Point
    \(Q\) says that 5 days after the genie has appeared, Purse A contains $2,000.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> What are the coordinates of the vertical intercept for each graph? Explain how you know. <br><br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> For Purse A, the vertical intercept is \((0,1,000)\) because when the genie appears (day
    0), the purse has $1,000. For Purse B, the vertical intercept is \((0,0.01)\) because it only contains $0.01 when
    the genie appears.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> When does Purse B become a better choice than Purse A? Be prepared to show your reasoning. <br><br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> According to the graphs, on day 19 and afterward, Purse B is worth more than Purse A. This
    can be seen on the graph since Purse B has a greater \(y\)-coordinate for the first time when \(x\) is 19.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> Knowing what you know now, which purse would you choose? Be prepared to show your reasoning. <br><br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here are some samples: Purse B is worth more after 19 days, but
    there may be other considerations students may take into account.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>While on a beach, your friend discovers a different genie. This genie also offers two purses to choose from, and he
  gives you the following graph to show how the money in each purse will grow. The set of triangular marks that lie on a
  line represent values in Purse A, and the set of square marks that make a curve represent those in Purse B.</p>
<p><img alt="Graph of 2 functions on grid."
    src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/af054ac5d2c2686ff0434298ac81349b314fe1e4" width="600"></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
  <li>The genie is still deciding how many days he will let the money in the purses grow. Help your friend plan a
    strategy for picking the purse with more money while the genie thinks.<br><br>
    <strong>Answer: </strong>Compare your answer:
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The vertical intercept for Purse B is lower, so Purse B starts off with less money than Purse A. The values in Purse
  B stay lower than the values in Purse A until day 10, when they appear to be the same. So Purse A is better up to day
  10, and after that point Purse B becomes a better choice.</p>
<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, okay,&rdquo; the genie smiles, disappointed. &ldquo;I will give you an even more enticing deal.&rdquo;
  He explains that Purse B stays the same, but Purse A now increases by $250,000 every day. Which purse should you
  choose?<br><br>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> Purse B surpasses Purse A on day 30, with about $10.7 million in Purse B and only about $7.5
  million in Purse A. So it&rsquo;s better to choose Purse A if the amounts grow for less than 30 days, and it&rsquo;s
  better to choose Purse B if they grow for 30 days or more.
</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Due to the exponential nature of the problem, the scale for the vertical axis makes it difficult to accurately
  estimate vertical coordinates of points from the graph. Remind students that they know how the value of each purse is
  calculated, so they may use calculations similar to those in the previous activity to compute actual dollar values.
</p>
<p>If color versions of the materials are not available, it may be difficult to determine which points correspond with
  which purse. Encourage students to imagine connecting the dots (perhaps using a ruler for Purse A) to distinguish the
  two sets of points.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their responses with the class. Discuss how they interpreted the points on the graphs and
  the intersection of the two graphs.</p>
<p>To highlight the power of using graphs to illustrate what is happening in a situation, ask, &ldquo;You have used
  calculations and graphs to compare the genie&rsquo;s offers. Did using graphs help? Did they add new insights to the
  offers?&rdquo; (The graphs give a clear visual representation of how the amount of money in each purse grows. It is
  easier to tell when Purse B becomes a better option than Purse A and how different the two values are at different
  points in time. They de-emphasize the actual numbers, so they give a very clean comparison of the two situations.)</p>
<p>Consider asking students to explain to a partner their response and reasoning to the last question: &ldquo;Knowing
  what you know now, which purse would you choose? Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <div class="os-raise-graybox">

<p>Both equations have a 2 and an \(x\) in them, but in \(y = 2x\), \(x\) is multiplied by 2, and in \(y = 2^x\), 2 is
  the base and \(x\) is the exponent. If you graph the equations together on the same grid, it makes it easier to
  discuss the key features and compare the graphs.</p>

<ul>
  <li> The graphs intersect at \((1, 2)\) and \((2, 4)\). </li>
  <li> \(y=2x\) has a \(y\)-intercept of \((0, 0)\). \(y=&szlig;2^x\) has a \(y\)-intercept of \((0, 1)\).&nbsp; </li>

<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to compare and contrast the graphs of \(y=3x+1\) and \(y=3^x\):</p>
<p>First, you need to graph both equations on the same plane.</p>
<p><img

<p>Then you can compare key features of the graph, like points where they are equal and intercepts. Answers may vary,
  but here is a sample answer. Your answer may include all or part of the sample.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li> The functions are equal at their \(y\)-intercept \((0,1)\) and also at \((1.6, 5.8)\).&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
  <li>\( y=3x+1\) is linear and is greater when \(0&lt;x&lt;1.6\).&nbsp; </li>
