<h4>Finding a Perpendicular Line Given an Equation and Point</h4>
<p>In this section, you will use what you know about writing the equation of a line given the slope and a point to write the equation of perpendicular lines. The graph shows the equation of the line \( y = 2x - 3 \). The point \( P(-2, 1) \) is also plotted. You can use the fact that perpendicular lines have slopes that are opposite reciprocals to find a line that is perpendicular to line \(l\) and goes through point \( P(-2, 1) \).</p>

<p>From the equation, you know the slope of the line is 2. The second line will pass through \( P(-2, 1) \) and have slope \( - \frac{1}{2} \). To graph the line, start at \( (-2, 1) \) and count out the rise and run. The slope is \( \frac{rise}{run}=\frac{-1}{2} \). Count out the rise, \( -1 \), and run, 2, and plot the point. You can graph the line as shown. Line \( n \) is perpendicular to line \( l \) and goes through point \( (-2, 1) \). </p>

<p>To find the equation of a line perpendicular to a line through a given point algebraically, you can use what you know about finding the equation of a line given the slope and a point.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Write an equation of a line perpendicular to \( y = 2x - 3 \) that contains the point \( (-2, 1) \). Write the equation in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p><b>Step 1 - </b> Find the slope of the given line.<br>
  The line is in slope-intercept form \( y = 2x - 3 \)<br>
  \( m=2 \) </p>
<p><b>Step 2 - </b> Find the slope of the perpendicular line<br>
  perpendicular lines have the inverse slope<br>
  \( m_1 = -1/2 \) </p>
<p><b>Step 3 - </b>Identify the point<br>
  The given point is \( (-2, 1) \)<br>
  \( (x_1, y_1) = (-2, 1) \) </p>
<p><b>Step 4 - </b>Substitute values into the point-slope form \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \)<br>
  Simplify<br>
  \( \begin{array}{rcl}y - y_1 &amp;=&amp; m(x - x_1) \\ y-1 &amp;=&amp; -\frac{1}{2}(x - (-2)) \\ y-1 &amp;=&amp; -\frac{1}{2}(x + 2) \\ y-1 &amp;=&amp; -\frac{1}{2}x - 1\end{array} \)</p>
<p><b>Step 5 - </b>Write the equation in slope-intercept form<br>
  \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x\) </p>
