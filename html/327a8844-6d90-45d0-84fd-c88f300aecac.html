<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>In the warm-up, students saw that some systems have infinitely many solutions. In this activity, they encounter a situation that can be represented with a system of equations, but the system has no solutions. Students write equations to represent the two constraints in the situation and then solve the system algebraically and graphically.</p>
<p>As students work, notice the different ways they reach the conclusion that the systems have no solutions. Identify students with varying strategies and ask them to share later.</p>

<h4>Launch</h4>

<p>Keep students in groups of 3&ndash;4 and provide access to graphing technology.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>


<p>A recreation center is offering special prices on its pool passes and gym memberships for the summer. On the first day of the offering, a family paid $96 for 4 pool passes and 2 gym memberships. Later that day, an individual bought a pool pass for herself, a pool pass for a friend, and 1 gym membership. She paid $72.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> Write a system of equations that represents the relationships between pool passes, gym memberships, and the costs. Be sure to state what each variable represents. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>\(\left\{\begin{array}{rlc}4p+2g&amp;=&amp;96 \\ 2p+1g&amp;=&amp;72\end{array}\right.\)</p>
<p>where \(p\) is the price of each pool pass and \(g\) is the price of a gym membership for 1 person.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li> Find the price of a pool pass and the price of a gym membership by solving the system algebraically. Be prepared to show your reasoning. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The system has no solutions. For example: Solving by elimination or substitution leads to a false equation (such as \(0=24\)).</p>

<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>Invite previously identified students to share their response to the second question. Record or display their reasoning for all to see. After each student shares, ask if anyone else reasoned the same way.<br></p>

<p>Next, select other students to share their observations about the graphs. Ask students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;How can we tell from the graphs that there are no solutions?&rdquo; (The lines are parallel.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How can we tell for sure that the lines are parallel and never intersect?&rdquo; (The slope of both graphs is \(-2\), but they have different intercepts.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Why do parallel lines mean no solutions?&rdquo; (A solution is a pair of values that satisfy both equations and are on both graphs. There are no points that are on both lines simultaneously.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;What does &lsquo;no solutions&rsquo; mean in this situation, in terms of price of pool passes and gym memberships?&rdquo; (The prices for a pool pass and for a gym membership are different for the two purchases.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some ways to think about the situation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The family purchased twice the number of of pool passes and gym memberships as the individual did, but they did not pay twice as much, so the prices of passes and memberships must have been different for the two purchases.</li>
  <li>The person who bought half as many passes and memberships did not pay half as much, which meant that different prices applied to the two transactions.</li>
  <li>The special rates for a family of 4 did not apply to the individual, hence the different prices.</li>
</ul>

<p>Use this routine to support reading comprehension of this problem. Ask students to keep their books or devices closed and display only the image and the task statement without revealing the questions that follow. Use the first read to orient students to the situation. After a shared reading, ask students: &ldquo;What is this situation about?&rdquo; (A recreation center sells pool passes and gym memberships.) After the second read, students list any quantities that can be counted or measured, without focusing on specific values (total amount of money paid by the family and by the individual, the number of pool passes and number of gym memberships purchased by each). During the third read, the questions are revealed. Invite students to discuss possible strategies, referencing the relevant quantities named after the second read.</p>

<h4>Solving an Inconsistent System of Equations</h4>
<p>Now that we have several methods for solving systems of equations, we can use the methods to identify inconsistent systems. Recall that an inconsistent system consists of parallel lines that have the same slope but different \(y\)-intercepts. They will never intersect. When searching for a solution to an inconsistent system, we will come up with a false statement, such as \( 12 = 0 \).<br></p>
<p>Solve the following system of equations. </p>
<p>\( x = 9 - 2y \) <br>\( x+2y =13 \)</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong> </p>
<p>We can approach this problem in two ways. Because one equation is already solved for \( x \), the most obvious step is to use substitution. </p>
<p>\( x+2y =13 \) <br>\( (9-2y)+2y =13 \) <br>\( 9+0y =13 \)<br>\( 9=13  \)</p>
<p>Clearly, this statement is a contradiction because \( 9 \neq 13 \). Therefore, the system has no solution. </p>
<p>The second approach would be to first manipulate the equations so that they are both in slope-intercept form. We manipulate the first equation as follows:</p>
<p>\( x = 9 - 2y \)<br>\( 2y = -x + 9x\)<br>\( y= -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{9}{2} \)</p>
<p>We then convert the second equation expressed to slope-intercept form. </p>
\( x + 2y = 13 \)<br>\( 2y = -x + 13\)<br>\( y= -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{13}{2} \)
<p>Comparing the equations, we see that they have the same slope but different \(y\)-intercepts. Therefore, the lines are parallel and do not intersect. </p>
<p>\( y= -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{9}{2} \)<br>\( y= -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{13}{2} \)<br></p>
<h4>Try It: Solving an Inconsistent System of Equations</h4>
<p>Solve the following system of equations. If there is no solution, explain how you know.</p>
<p>\( 9x +3y = -24 \)<br>\( 6x +2y = 14 \)</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Here is how to solve this system of equations:</p>
<p>To solve using elimination, we must first make the coefficients of one of the variables the same to use subtraction.</p>
<p>\( 2(9x +3y) = 2(-24) \)<br>\( 3(6x +2y) = 3(14) \)</p>
<p>After simplifying, we have:</p>
<p>\( 18x +6y = -48 \)<br>\( 18x +6y = 42 \)</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s subtract the equations:</p>
<p>\( 18x +6y = -48 \)<br>\( 18x +6y = 42 \)<br>\( 0 = -90 \)</p>
<p>Since this equation can never be true, the system has no solutions.</p>
<p>Using another method, you can also write each equation in slope-intercept form:</p>
<p>\( y = -3x - 8 \)<br>\( y = -3x - 7 \)</p>
<p>Since the equations have the same slope and different \(y\)-intercepts, we know that the system has no solution.</p>
