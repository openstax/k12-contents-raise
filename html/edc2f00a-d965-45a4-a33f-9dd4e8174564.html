<h4>Reasoning about Solution Sets to Linear Inequalities</h4>
<p dir="ltr">You can derive a lot of information about the solution set to an inequality by studying the inequality itself. <br></p>
<p dir="ltr">Let&rsquo;s look at the inequality shown.</p>
<p dir="ltr">\(12x&gt;-3(x&minus;1)\)</p>
<p dir="ltr">The left side of the inequality contains \(12x\). The right side of the inequality contains \(-3x\).</p>
<p dir="ltr">We can think to ourselves: &ldquo;What values of \(x\) would make \(12x\) greater than \(-3x\)?&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If \(x\) is a large positive number, then \(12x\) will still be positive. If \(x\) is a large positive number, then \(-3x\) will be a negative number. This makes the inequality true, so the solution set must include large positive numbers.</p><br>
<p dir="ltr">Let&rsquo;s solve the related equation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">\(\begin{array}{rcl}12x&amp;&gt;&amp;-3(x-1)\\12x\;&amp;=&amp;\;&ndash;3(x\;&ndash;\;1)\\12x\;&amp;=&amp;\;&ndash;3x\;+3\\15x\;&amp;=&amp;\;3\\x\;&amp;=&amp;\;\frac{3}{15}\end{array}\)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since we know that the solution set must include large positive numbers, then \(x &gt; \frac{3}{15}\) must be the solution to the inequality.</p>
