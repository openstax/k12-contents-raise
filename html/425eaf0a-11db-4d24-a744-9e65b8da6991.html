<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>The goal of this activity is for students to recognize that rewriting a quadratic expression from standard form to vertex form essentially entails completing the square.</p>
<p>Students had quite a bit of experience completing the square, mostly in the context of solving equations, in which they know to add or subtract the same number from both sides of an equation to keep the equation true. Here, students are dealing with expressions and need to be careful to keep each expression equivalent to the original. If they add a number to the expression, they need to remember to subtract the same number to keep the value of the expression unchanged.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Give students quiet time to think about the first two questions and then time to share their thinking with a partner.</p>
<p>Pause for a class discussion after the second question and invite one or more students to demonstrate their strategy. Highlight approaches that involve completing the square. If no students took that approach, display and discuss the following:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> \(x^2&minus;6x+2\) </li>
  <li> \(x^2&minus;6x+9&minus;9+2\) </li>
  <li> \((x&minus;3)^2&minus;7\) </li>
</ul>
<p>Then, ask students to proceed with the rest of the activity. Provide access to devices that can run Desmos or other graphing technology.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>You've expanded from factored form to standard form. To learn how to convert from standard form to vertex form (of a quadratic expression), start by going backward and convert a quadratic from vertex form to standard form.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Rewrite \((x+5)^2+1\) in standard form.</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x^2+10x+26\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Rewrite \((x&minus;3)^2&minus;7\) in standard form.</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x^2&minus;6x+2\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Think about the steps you took, and about reversing them. Try converting one or both of the expressions in standard form back into vertex form. Explain how you go about converting the expressions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> To convert \(x^2&minus;6x+2\) back to vertex form, you can complete the square by adding 9 and then subtracting 9 so that the expression remains unchanged. The part that is a perfect square, \(x^2&minus;6x+9\), can be written as \((x&minus;3)^2\), and then there is the \(2&minus;9\), which equals -7.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>Test your strategy by rewriting \(x^2+10x+9\) in vertex form.</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \((x+5)^2&minus;16\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>Let's check the expression you rewrote in vertex form. Use the Desmos graphing tool or technology outside the course to graph both \(x^2+10x+9\) and your new expression.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
  <li>Does it appear that both expressions define the same function?</li>
</ol>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> Yes </li>
  <li> No </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes<br>
  Both expressions seem to produce the same graph.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" class="os-raise-noindent" start="2" type="a">
  <li>If you convert your expression in vertex form back into standard form, do you get \(x^2+10x+9\)?</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \((x+5)^2&minus;16=x^2+10x+25&minus;16\), which is \(x^2+10x+9\).</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may wonder why they need to both add and subtract a number from the standard form expression in order to complete the square. In previous lessons, students completed the square while solving an equation, often adding the same number to each side of the equal sign to maintain equality. Here, there is no equal sign. Emphasize that each move must generate an equivalent expression. Show a few expressions such as 5, \(5+0\), \(5&minus;2+2\), \(5+7&minus;7\), \(5+8\), and \(5+8&minus;3\). Ask them which ones are equal to 5. Next, ask them to write two more expressions that include the number 5 and also equal 5. Encourage students to notice that the sum of the numbers excluding 5 must be 0.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their graph and response to the last question. Emphasize that while graphing is a quick way to check whether two expressions define the same function, it is not always reliable. If we make an algebraic error, the graph would almost certainly show it. But having two graphs that appear to be identical does not prove that two expressions are indeed equivalent. We can only be sure that two expressions define the same function by showing equivalence algebraically. For example, when students convert the expression in vertex form back to standard form, does it produce the original expression?</p>
<p>Make sure students understand that whatever operation is performed on an expression to complete the square, it should not change the value of the expression. Adding opposites (for example, 9 and -9, or -25 and 25), or adding and subtracting the same number, has the effect of adding 0, which keeps the original and the transformed expressions equivalent.</p>

<h4>Standard to Vertex Form</h4>
<p>Different forms are useful for finding different characteristics of quadratic functions.</p>
<p>Practice writing \(x^2+8x-7\) into vertex form (of a quadratic expression).</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Work to complete the square:<br>
  \(b=8\), so \((\frac{b}{2})^2=(\frac{8}{2})^2=16\). </p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Add the value to create the perfect square, and subtract the value from the original constant (this is like adding 0).<br>
  \(x^2+8x+16-7-16\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Factor the trinomial and simplify.<br>
  \((x+4)^2-23\)</p>

<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to write the quadratic expression in vertex form:</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
