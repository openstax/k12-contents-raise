<h2>Activity (20 minutes)</h2>
<p>In this activity, students write and graph equations to represent two constraints in the same situation and use tables and graphs to see possible values that satisfy the constraints. The work prompts them to think about a pair of values that simultaneously meets multiple constraints in the situation, which in turn helps them make sense of the phrase &ldquo;a solution to both equations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monitor for these likely strategies for completing the tables, from less precise to more precise:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Guessing and checking</li>
  <li>Using the graph (by identifying the point with a given \( x \)- or \( y \)-value and estimating the unknown value, or using technology to get an estimate)</li>
  <li>Substituting the given value of one variable into the equation and solving for the other variable</li>
</ul>
<p>Identify students who use each strategy and ask them to share later.</p>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2 and provide access to graphing technology. Explain to students that they will now examine the same situation involving two quantities (raisins and walnuts), but there are now two constraints (cost and weight).</p>
<p>Give students 3&ndash;4 minutes of quiet time to complete the first set of questions about the cost constraint, and then pause for a whole-class discussion. Select previously identified students to share their strategies, in the order listed in the Activity Narrative. If one of the strategies is not mentioned, bring it up. </p>
<p>Ask a student who used the graph to complete the table to explain how exactly they used the graph. For example: &ldquo;How did you use the graph of \( 4x+8y=15 \) to find \( y \) when \( x \) is 2?&rdquo; Make sure students recognize that this typically involves hovering over different points on the graph or tracing the graph to get the coordinates. </p>
<p>Ask students to proceed with the remainder of the activity. If time permits, pause again after the second set of questions (about the weight constraint) to discuss how the strategies for completing the second table are like or unlike those for completing the first table. Alternatively, give students a minute to confer with their partner before moving on to the last question.</p>

    <br>
<h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>
<p>Some students might think that the values in the second table need to reflect a total cost of $15. Clarify that the table represents only the constraint that Diego bought a total of 2 pounds of raisins and walnuts.</p>
<p>The idea of finding an \( (x,y) \) pair that satisfies multiple constraints should be familiar from middle school. If students struggle to answer the last question, ask them to study the values in the table. Ask questions such as: &ldquo;If Diego bought 0.25 pound of raisins, would he meet both the cost and weight requirements?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Which combinations of raisins and walnuts would allow him to meet both requirements? How many combinations are there?&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>Invite students to share their response and reasoning for the last question. Display the graphs representing the system (either created by a student or as shown in the Student Response). Discuss with students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Can you find other combinations of raisins and walnuts, besides 0.25 pound and 1.75 pounds, that meet both cost and weight constraints?&rdquo; (No)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How many possible combinations of raisins and walnuts meet both constraints? How do we know?&rdquo; (One combination, because the graphs intersect only at one point.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Explain to students that the two equations written to represent the constraints form a<em> </em><strong>system of equations</strong>. We use a curly bracket to indicate a system, like this: </p>
<p>\( \begin{cases}\begin {align} 4x + 8y &amp;= 15\\ x+ \hspace{2mm}y&amp;=2 \end{align} \end{cases} \)</p>
<p>Highlight that the solution to the system is a pair of values (in this case, pounds of raisins and walnuts) that meet both constraints. This means the pair of values is a solution to both equations. Graphing is an effective way to see the solution to both equations, if one exists.</p>

  <h4>Solve Systems of Linear Equations
  </h4>
  <p>In Unit 1, you learned how to solve linear equations with one variable. Now we will work with two or more linear equations grouped together, which is known as a system of linear equations.</p>
  <p>An example of a system of two linear equations is shown below. We use a brace to show the two equations are grouped together to form a system of equations.</p>
  <p>\(\left\{\begin{array}{l}2x\;+\;y\;=\;7\\x\;-\;2y\;=\;6\end{array}\right.\)</p>
  <p>A linear equation in two variables, such as \( 2x + y = 7 \), has an infinite number of solutions. Its graph is a line. Remember, every point on the line is a solution to the equation, and every solution to the equation is a point on the line.</p>
  <p>To determine if an ordered pair is a solution to a system of two equations, we substitute the values of the variables into each equation. If the ordered pair makes both equations true, it is a solution to the system.</p>
  <p>To solve a system of two linear equations, we want to find the values of the variables that are solutions to both equations. In other words, we are looking for the ordered pairs (x, y) that make both equations true. These are called the solutions to a system of equations.</p>
  <p>To determine if an ordered pair is a solution to a system of two equations, we substitute the values of the variables into each equation. If the ordered pair makes both equations true, it is a solution to the system.</p>
  <h5>Example</h5>
<p>Determine whether the ordered pair is a solution to the system\( \left\{\begin{array}{l}x\;-\;y\;=\;-1\\2x\;-\;y\;=\;-5\end{array}\right. \).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>
    \( (-2, -1) \)
  </li>
  <li>
    \( (-4, -3) \)
  </li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>Here is how to do this:</p>
<p>\(\left\{\begin{array}{c}x-y=-1\\2x-y=-5\end{array}\right.\)</p>
<p>We substitute \(x=-2\) and \(y=-1\) into both equations. </p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rr}
x-y=-1 & 2x-y=-5 \\
-2-(-1) \stackrel{?}{=} -1 & 2\cdot(-2)-(-1)\stackrel{?}{=} -5 \\
-1=-1 \checkmark & -3 \neq -5
\end{array}\)
</p>
<p>(-2,-1) does not make both equations true. </p> 
   <p> (-2,-1) is not a solution.  </p>
<p>We substitute \(x=-4\) and \(y=-3\) into both equations.</p>
<p>
\(\begin{array}{rr}x-y=-1 & 2x-y=-5 \\
  -4-(-3) \stackrel{?}{=} -1  & 2(-4)-(-3) \stackrel{?}{=} -5 \\
   -1=-1 \checkmark & -5=-5 \checkmark \end{array}\)

</p>
<p>\((-4,-3)\) is true for both equations. It is a solution.</p>

<h3>Solve a System of Linear Equations by Graphing</h3>
<p>The graph of a linear equation is a line. Each point on the line is a solution to the equation. For a system of two equations, we will graph two lines. Then we can see all the points that are solutions to each equation. And by finding what the lines have in common, we&rsquo;ll find the solution to the system.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong><strong>:</strong> Solve the system by graphing \(\left\{\begin{array}{l}2x\;+\;y\;=\;7\\x\;-\;2y\;=\;6\end{array}\right.\)</p>
<p><b>Step 1.</b> Graph the first equations.</p>
<p>To graph the
                first line, write the equation in slope-intercept form.
              \(2x+y=7\)
              \(Y=-2x+7\)
\(M=-2 b=7\) </p>
<p>\(\left\{\begin{array}{l}2x+y=7\\x-2y=6\end{array}\right.\) <br>

<p><b>Step 3.</b> Determine whether the lines intersect, are parallel, or are the same line. </p>
<p>Look at the
graph of the lines.<br>
The lines
                intersect.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b>.
Identify the solution to the system. </p>
<ul>
  <li>If the lines intersect, identify the point of
    intersection. Check to make sure it is a solution to both equations. This is
    the solution to the system.<br>
  </li>
  <li>If the lines are parallel, the system has no
    solution.<br>
  </li>
  <li>If the lines are the same, the system has an infinite
    number of solutions. </li>
</ul>
<p>Since the 
                lines intersect, find the point of intersection.
              Check the
    point in both equations.</p>


      <p>The lines
                intersect at (4,-1).

    <p><strong>Step 3 - </strong> Determine whether the lines intersect. <br>
    The lines intersect at one point.    </p>
    <p><strong>Step 4 - </strong> Identify the solution to the system. </p>
<ul>
      <li> If the lines intersect, identify the point of intersection. This is the solution to the system. </li>
    </ul>
      <p>The lines intersect at \((3, 2)\). </p>
      <p><strong>Step 5 -</strong> Check the solution in both equations. <br>
