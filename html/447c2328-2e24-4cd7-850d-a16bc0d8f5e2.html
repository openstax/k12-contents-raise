      <li> Each number is half of the previous number. We can find the next number by multiplying the current number by \(\frac12\) or by 0.5, or by dividing by 2. </li>
      <li> The non-zero digits of the decimals are powers of 5 (\(5^1\), \(5^2\), \(5^3\), etc.), and each time there is an additional decimal place. </li>
      <li> 0.5 can be written as \(\frac{5}{10}\), 0.25 as \(\frac{25}{100}\), and 0.125 as \(\frac{125}{1,000}\). The numerators are powers of 5, and the denominators are powers of 10, so the next two numbers are \(\frac{5^4}{10^4}\), which is \(\frac{65}{10,000}\) or 0.0625, and \(\frac{5^5}{10^5}\), which is \(\frac{3,125}{100,000}\) or 0.03125. </li>
