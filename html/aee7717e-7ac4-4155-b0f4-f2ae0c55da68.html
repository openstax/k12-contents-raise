<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3><br>
  <h4>Student Activity</h4>
   <p>Use the following scenerio for questions 1 and 2.</p>
  <blockquote><p>Lin&rsquo;s job pays $8.25 an hour plus $10 of transportation allowance each week. She has to work at least 5 hours a week to keep the job, and she can earn up to $175 per week, including $10 to cover transportation per week.</p></blockquote>
    


<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li>Represent this situation mathematically. If you use variables, specify what each one means.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p>Your answer may vary, but here is an example.</p>
<p>\(8.25h\;+\;10\;\leq\;175\) and \(h\;\geq\;5\), where \(h\) represents the number of hours Lin works in a week.</span></span></p>
  

      
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
    <li>How many hours per week can Lin work? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p>Your answer may vary, but here is an example.</p>
<p>At least 5 hours and at most 20 hours (or \(5\leq\;h\;\leq20\)). For example: The maximum amount she could earn, not including the transportation allowance, is $165. That amount is equal to 20 hours of work, \(\frac{165}{8.25}=20\)."</p>
   




    

  <h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
  <h5>More Chances</h5>
  <p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
  <p>Students will have more opportunities in Lesson 2.12 (Solving Problems with Inequalities in Two Variables) to write inequalities to represent a situation.</p>
