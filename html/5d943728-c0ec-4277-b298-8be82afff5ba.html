<li>Use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation to find its slope and y-intercept.</li>
<li>Find the x- and y-intercepts of a line when given its equation.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are still struggling, be sure to reach out to your teacher for additional help. Nobody is good at problems like this the first try. Keep at it and it will get easier.</p>
