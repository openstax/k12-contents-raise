<h4> Writing Exponential Decay Functions</h4>
<p>A car sells for $4,000 and loses \(\frac18\) of its value each year. Write a function that gives the car&rsquo;s value, \(V(t)\), \(t\)&nbsp;years after it is sold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the car loses \(\frac18\) of its value each year, it keeps \(\frac78\) of its value from year to year, so the growth factor is \(\frac78\).</p>
<p>\(V(t)=4000 \cdot (\frac{7}{8})^t\)</p>

<p>Here is how to write the exponential function:&nbsp;</p>
<p>The starting amount is $1,000. The computer loses \(\frac15\) of its value each year, so it maintains \(\frac45\) of its value. The growth factor is \(\frac45\).</p>
<p>The function is then \(V(t)=1000 \cdot (\frac{4}{5})^t\).</p>
