<h4> Writing Exponential Decay Functions</h4>
<p>Example 1</p>
<p>Data has been entered into a table that shows exponential decay.&nbsp; How would you write the equation that represents this model?&nbsp;</p>
<table class="os-raise-horizontaltable">

<p>The formula for exponential decay is \(y=a \cdot (1-b)^x\) where a is the starting value and \(b\) is the amount that value decreases each unit of time \(x\).</p>
<p>The pattern for the decay is starting at 200 and then decreasing by 12 with only 12 remaining. The equation is \(y=200 \cdot (1-\frac12)^x\) or \(y=200 \cdot (\frac12)^x\).</p>

<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 2</p>
<p>A car sells for $4,000 and loses \(\frac18\) of its value each year. Write a function that gives the car&rsquo;s
  value, \(V(t)\), \(t\) years after it is sold.</p>
<p>Since the car loses \(\frac18\) of its value each year, it keeps \(\frac78\) of its value from year to year, so the
  growth factor is \(\frac78\).</p>
<p>\(V(t)=4000 \cdot (\frac{7}{8})^t\)</p>

    <p>This ball is more bouncy. Each bounce of this ball reaches a height that is about 0.7 times that of the previous
      bounce \((51.5 \div 73.5 \approx 0.7)\). The tennis ball in the earlier task loses about half of its height with
      each bounce. </p>

  <p>Here is how to write the exponential function:&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The starting amount is $1,000. The computer loses \(\frac15\) of its value each year, so it maintains \(\frac45\) of its value. The growth factor is \(\frac45\).</p>
  <p>The function is then \(V(t)=1000 \cdot (\frac{4}{5})^t\).</p>
