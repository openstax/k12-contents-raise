<p>In this activity, whenever you see &#128172;, stop and share your responses with your partner. If you have different responses, try to come to a consensus.</p>
<p>For questions 1-3, use the instructions below.</p>
<blockquote>Use the simulation screen labeled “Variables”. Note you can switch between simulation screens using the toolbar located below the area model.</blockquote>


<p>Use the <em>Variables Screen</em> to answer the following questions.</p>
<p>
  1. Play around with entering your own variable expressions, then answer the following. <br> <br>
  a. In an area model, how do the partial products (interior numbers) get calculated?<br> <br>
  b. In an area model, how does the total area get calculated?<br> <br>
  c.  How do the partial products relate to the total area of the area model? <br>
</p>


<p>
  2. Use the sim to model 6(x+8). What is the total area of this rectangle? Represent the total area in multiple ways. &#128172;<br>

  3. Use the sim to model \((x+3)(x-5)\). What is the total area of this rectangle? Represent the total area in multiple ways. &#128172;<br>

   <br>


</p>
<p>
  4. Challenge yourself to work through levels 1 - 4 of the <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/area-model-algebra/latest/area-model-algebra_en.html?screens=4" target="_blank">Area Model Algebra Game</a>! <br>
</p>


<p>5. How is multiplying variable expressions using an area model similar to multiplying numbers using an area model? <br>

    <h4>Extension</h4> 

    <p>
      Challenge yourself to work backwards and factor an algebraic expression!

    The Area Model sim is playing tricks on you! It gives you the partial products, but not the side lengths. What numbers and/or variables must be on the outside of this rectangle? </p>
