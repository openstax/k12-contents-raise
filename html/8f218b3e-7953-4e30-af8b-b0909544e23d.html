<p>Use the <em>Variables Screen</em> to answer the following questions.</p>
<p>
  1. Play around with entering your own variable expressions, then answer the following. <br>
  a. In an area model, how do the partial products (interior numbers) get calculated?<br>
<br>
  b. In an area model, how does the total area get calculated?<br>
  c.  How do the partial products relate to the total area of the area model? <br>
</p>


<p>
  2. Use the sim to model 6(x+8).<br>

  What is the total area of this rectangle? Represent the total area in multiple ways. &#128172;<br>
</p>

<p>
  3. Use the sim to model \((x+3)(x-5)\). <br>
  <img height="300" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/6b94112d13fd4e2278fecf9f89d55f70d1566205"><br>
   What is the total area of this rectangle? Represent the total area in multiple ways.   &#128172;<br>

  4. Challenge yourself to work through levels 1-4 of the <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/area-model-algebra/latest/area-model-algebra_en.html?screens=4" target="_blank">Area Model Algebra Game</a>! <br>
  In this challenge, students are given different rectangular scenarios that involve variables and asked to determine partial products, dimensions, etc. Students may choose their level of difficulty/challenge.

<p>5. How is multiplying variable expressions using an area model similar to multiplying numbers using an area model? <br>

    The Area Model sim is playing tricks on you! It gives you the partial products, but not the side lengths. What numbers and/or variables must be on the outside of this rectangle? </p>
