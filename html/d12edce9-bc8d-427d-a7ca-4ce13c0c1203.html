<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity complements the previous one. For a situation characterized by exponential growth, a larger base value \(b\) means faster growth. For a situation characterized by exponential decay, however, a smaller value of \(b\) (between 0 and 1) corresponds to faster decay. Understanding how the parameter \(b\) influences the graph of an exponential function will prepare students to make sense of and model situations involving repeated percentage change later in the unit.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Present the following scenario: &ldquo;Suppose you are presented with four functions, \(m\), \(n\), \(p\), and \(q\),<em>&nbsp;</em>that describe the amount of money, in dollars, in a bank account as a function of time \(x\), in years. If the account is yours (and more money is better), which function would you choose? Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here are equations defining the functions.</p>
<p>\(m(x)=200 \cdot (\frac{1}{4})^x\)</p>
<p>\(n(x)=200 \cdot (\frac{1}{2})^x\)</p>
<p>\(p(x)=200 \cdot (\frac{3}{4})^x\)</p>
<p>\(q(x)=200 \cdot (\frac{7}{8})^x\)</p>
<p>Give students quiet think time and ask students to share their responses. Ask a student who chose the first option and one who chose the last option to share their reasoning. Tell students they will now consider the options graphically before confirming their choice.</p>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Provide access to graphing technology.</p>
<h5> Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<div>
<p>In groups of 2, students should take turns explaining their reasoning of how they matched the equations to the graphs. Display the following sentence frames for all to see: &ldquo;The equation _____ matches graph _____ because . . .&rdquo; and &ldquo;I noticed _____ , so I matched . . . .&rdquo; Encourage students to challenge each other when they disagree. When monitoring the discussions, point out key words and phrases such as &ldquo;the bases are less than 1,&rdquo; &ldquo;slowly decaying,&rdquo; or &ldquo;more vertical curve.&rdquo; This will help students solidify their understanding of how the &ldquo;b&rdquo; affects the graph.</p>
</div>

<h5> Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>
<div>
<p>Differentiate the degree of difficulty by beginning with more accessible values. When presenting the scenario, begin by displaying only \(m(x)\) and \(p(x)\) for students to consider briefly before revealing the remaining functions. In addition, some students may benefit from revisiting findings from the warm-up, in which after spending \(\frac13\) of the gift money, Jada had \(\frac23\) left.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Sample reasoning: The functions are all exponential, and the bases are all less than 1, so the graphs will be decreasing. The most rapidly decreasing will be the one with the smallest base, and the least rapidly decreasing will be the one with the largest base. </p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Focus the discussion on the connection between the numbers in the equation (especially the \(b\)) and the features of the graph. Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;In the first question, what does the point that the graphs share on the \(y\)-axis say about the situation?&rdquo; (All of the accounts started with $200.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;How does Graph A compare to Graph D?&rdquo; (Graph A appears more horizontal, so the function is decaying at a slower rate.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;What does the largest factor (\(\frac78\)) tell us? To which graph does it correspond?&rdquo; (The function loses only \(\frac18\) of its value when \(x\) increases by 1, so it is decaying the most slowly. Graph A must be the graph of \(q(x)=200 \cdot (\frac{7}{8})^x\) since it shows the slowest decay.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;What might a graph representing a function \(v\) given by \(v(x)=200 \cdot (\frac{99}{100})^x\) look like?&rdquo; (It would look very close to a horizontal line because nearly all of its value remains as \(x\) increases by 1, so it is decaying very slowly.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;What might a graph representing a function \(w\) given by \(w(x)=200 \cdot (\frac{1}{100})^x\) look like?&rdquo; (It will go toward 0 extremely quickly because it loses \(\frac{99}{100}\) of its value each time \(x\) increases by 1, so it is decaying very quickly.)</li>
<li>Emphasize that, in situations characterized by exponential growth (when \(b&gt;1\)), a larger value of \(b\) means a curve that is more vertical. In situations characterized by exponential decay, where \(b\) is between 0 and 1, the closer \(b\) is to 1, the more the graph approaches a horizontal line. Conversely, the smaller the value of \(b\), the more swiftly it heads toward 0 (the more vertical the curve is) before it flattens out and approaches a horizontal line.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Matching Exponential Functions and Graphs</h4>
<p>For each of the following, match each function with one of the graphs in the picture below.</p>

<p>Remember, the equation for an exponential function is \(y=a\cdot b^x\). The \(a\) will affect the \(y\)-intercept. When \(b&lt;1\), there is exponential decay. The closer \(b\) is to 0, the faster it decays. The closer \(b\) is to 1, the slower it decays. When \(b&gt;1\), the larger the value of \(b\), the faster it grows.</p>

<p>In the graph above, which function, \(f(x)=a \cdot b^x\), has the largest value for \(a\)?</p>
<p>Write down your answer. Then select the <strong>Solution </strong>button to check your work.</p>
<h5> Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to identify which has the largest value for \(a\):</p>
<p>In the function \(f(x)=a \cdot b^x\), \(a\) changes the \(y\)-intercept. The function with the largest \(y\)-intercept is C. It crosses the \(y\)-axis at the highest point.</p>
