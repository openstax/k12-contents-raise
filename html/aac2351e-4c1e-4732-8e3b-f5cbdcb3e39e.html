<h3> Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>Here, students make sense of a graph representing a situation characterized by exponential decay. They justify why the amount of insulin in a patient&rsquo;s body could change exponentially and use the graph to answer questions about the situation. The numbers, chosen explicitly to provide a realistic model of the insulin context, are more complex than what students have seen so far. They will need to apply their understanding both to identify the growth factor and to write an expression showing how much insulin remains after \(m\) minutes.</p>
<p>In this activity, students are building skills that will help them in mathematical modeling (MP4). They don&rsquo;t decide which model to use, but students have an opportunity to figure out how to justify that an exponential model is a good model for the data. Also, they are prompted to construct an equation to represent the model in a scaffolded way.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Explain that insulin is a hormone that is needed to process glucose (sugar) in the body. For people with diabetes, a disorder in which the body cannot process glucose properly or does not produce enough insulin, injections of insulin are sometimes needed. Once in the bloodstream, insulin breaks down fairly rapidly, so additional injections are needed over the course of a day to control the person&rsquo;s glucose.</p>
<p>Display the graph for all to see. Ask students to observe the graph and be prepared to share one thing they notice and one thing they wonder. Give students a moment to share their observations and questions with a partner.</p>

  <p> Use this routine to support reading comprehension without solving for students. Be sure to display the task statement along with the corresponding graph representing the situation. Use the first read to orient students to the situation. Ask students to describe what the situation is about without using numbers (a diabetic patient who receives insulin). Use the second read to identify quantities and relationships. Ask students what can be counted or measured without focusing on the values. Listen for, and amplify, the important quantities that vary in relation to each other in this situation: amount of insulin and time in minutes. After the third read, ask students to brainstorm possible strategies to answer the questions.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>A patient who is diabetic receives 100 micrograms of insulin. The graph shows the amount of insulin, in micrograms, remaining in his bloodstream over time, in minutes.</p>

  <li>
    Scientists have found that the amount of insulin in a patient&rsquo;s body changes exponentially. How can you check if the graph supports the scientists&rsquo; claim?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong> If the insulin decays exponentially, that means that after each minute, the same fraction of insulin will decay and remain. So one way to check if this prediction matches the data is to see what fraction of insulin decays (or remains) after the first minute, then after the second minute, and so on. If these fractions are the same, then the graph supports the scientists&rsquo; claim.

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may notice that the insulin values decrease by \(\frac{1}{10}\) each minute and say, in response to the first two questions, that \(\frac{1}{10}\) of the original insulin remains after each minute. Ask them what \(\frac{1}{10}\) of 10 micrograms (mcg) is. Then ask them if that is the amount of insulin that remains after 1 minute. If needed, ask them what fraction of 10 mcg is the amount of insulin that remains after 1 minute. Is that the same as the fraction of 9 mcg of insulin that remains after 2 minutes?</p>
<h4> Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their responses with the class. If not already mentioned in students&rsquo; explanations, highlight the connections between the equation, the graph, and the quantities in the situation. Ask students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;How can we use an equation to express the micrograms of insulin in the body (\(I\)) after \(m\) minutes using an equation?&rdquo; \((I=10 \cdot (\frac{9}{10})^m)\)
  </li>
  <li>&ldquo;Where can we see the 10 mcg in the graph?&rdquo; (the vertical intercept)
  </li>
  <li>&ldquo;What about the \(\frac{9}{10}\)?&rdquo; (The coordinates tell us that \(\frac{1}{10}\) of insulin gets removed each minute, so \(\frac{9}{10}\) of it, which is most of it, is left in the body every minute. The amount of insulin decays relatively slowly, which shows in the points dropping gradually.)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Also consider asking:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Will there be any insulin remaining in the bloodstream an hour after the injection?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;If so, when will the body completely run out of insulin?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>These are difficult questions to answer. The mathematical model will never reach 0 because a positive quantity multiplied by \(\frac{9}{10}\) is always positive. Practically speaking, however, the insulin given to the patient will eventually disappear, unless a new dose is injected. The model also doesn&rsquo;t account for any insulin that the body produces naturally. This is a good opportunity to remind students that mathematical models are simplified descriptions of reality.</p>

<h4>More Exponential Models</h4>
<p>The graph shows the amount of a chemical in a patient&rsquo;s body at different times, measured in hours since the levels were first checked.</p>
<p>Could the amount of this chemical in the patient be decaying exponentially? Explain how you know.</p>
<p><img alt="Graph of a function on grid, origin O. Horizontal axis, time in hours, from 0 to 8 by 1's. Vertical axis, chemical in milligrams, from 0 to 1,200 by 200's.&lt;br&gt; Labeled plotted coordinates as follows: 0 comma 1,000, 1 comma 600, 2 comma 360, with 6 additional points plotted following a similar trend." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/6067169e5114ec7c6decefb23c92843d3d582b07"></p>
<p>The graph does seem to have the shape of exponential decay. To confirm if the chemical in the patient is decaying exponentially, you can find the growth factor. Since terms are usually multiplied by the growth factor, you can divide consecutive terms to see if there is the same growth factor each time.</p>
<p>Since \(\frac{600}{1000}=\frac{360}{600}=\frac{6}{10}\), the growth factor is \(\frac{6}{10}\). Therefore, it is decaying exponentially, and the equation is \(y = 1000 (\frac{6}{10})^x\), where \(y\) is the amount of chemical in mg in the patient and \(x\) is the time in hours.</p>

<p>Write down your answer. Then select the<strong> Solution </strong>button to check your work.</p>
<h5>Solution:</h5>
<p>Here is how to check the table to see if it represents an exponential relationship:</p>
<p>Just like the values of a graph, you can divide consecutive terms to find the growth factor. If each set of consecutive terms has the same ratio, the relationship is exponential. In this situation, dividing consecutive terms results in \(\frac{600}{300}=\frac{1200}{600}=\frac{2400}{1200}=2\). Therefore, the situation represents exponential growth and can also be represented by the equation \(y= 300(2)^x\), where \(y\) is the number of people who have read a book and \(x\) is the number of months.</p>
