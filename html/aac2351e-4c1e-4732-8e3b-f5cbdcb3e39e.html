<h3> Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>Here, students make sense of a graph representing a situation characterized by exponential decay. They justify why
  the amount of insulin in a patient’s body could change exponentially and use the graph to answer questions about
  the situation. The numbers, chosen explicitly to provide a realistic model of the insulin context, are more complex
  than what students have seen so far. They will need to apply their understanding both to identify the growth factor
  and to write an expression showing how much insulin remains after \(m\) minutes.</p>
<p>In this activity, students are building skills that will help them in mathematical modeling (A.1(D)). They don’t
  decide which model to use, but students have an opportunity to figure out how to justify that an exponential model is
  a good model for the data. Also, they are prompted to construct an equation to represent the model in a scaffolded
  way.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Explain that insulin is a hormone that is needed to process glucose (sugar) in the body. For people with diabetes, a
  disorder in which the body cannot process glucose properly or does not produce enough insulin, injections of insulin
  are sometimes needed. Once in the bloodstream, insulin breaks down fairly rapidly, so additional injections are needed
  over the course of a day to control the person’s glucose.</p>
<p>Display the graph for all to see. Ask students to observe the graph and be prepared to share one thing they notice
  and one thing they wonder. Give students a moment to share their observations and questions with a partner.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>A patient who is diabetic receives 100 micrograms of insulin. The graph shows the amount of insulin, in micrograms,
  remaining in his bloodstream over time, in minutes.</p>

    Scientists have found that the amount of insulin in a patient’s body changes exponentially. How can you check
    if the graph supports the scientists’ claim?<br/><br/><strong>Answer:</strong> If the insulin decays
    exponentially, that means that after each minute, the same fraction of insulin will decay and remain. So one way to
    check if this prediction matches the data is to see what fraction of insulin decays (or remains) after the first
    minute, then after the second minute, and so on. If these fractions are the same, then the graph supports the
    scientists’ claim.

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may notice that the insulin values decrease by \(\frac{1}{10}\) each minute and say, in response to the
  first two questions, that \(\frac{1}{10}\) of the original insulin remains after each minute. Ask them what
  \(\frac{1}{10}\) of 10 micrograms (mcg) is. Then ask them if that is the amount of insulin that remains after 1
  minute. If needed, ask them what fraction of 10 mcg is the amount of insulin that remains after 1 minute. Is that the
  same as the fraction of 9 mcg of insulin that remains after 2 minutes?</p>
<h4> Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their responses with the class. If not already mentioned in students’ explanations,
  highlight the connections between the equation, the graph, and the quantities in the situation. Ask students:</p>
<ul>
<li>“How can we use an equation to express the micrograms of insulin in the body (\(I\)) after \(m\) minutes
    using an equation?” \((I=10 \cdot (\frac{9}{10})^m)\)
  </li>
<li>“Where can we see the 10 mcg in the graph?” (the vertical intercept)
  </li>
<li>“What about the \(\frac{9}{10}\)?” (The coordinates tell us that \(\frac{1}{10}\) of insulin gets
    removed each minute, so \(\frac{9}{10}\) of it, which is most of it, is left in the body every minute. The amount of
    insulin decays relatively slowly, which shows in the points dropping gradually.)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Also consider asking:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Will there be any insulin remaining in the bloodstream an hour after the injection?”</li>
<li>“If so, when will the body completely run out of insulin?”</li>
</ul>
<p>These are difficult questions to answer. The mathematical model will never reach 0 because a positive quantity
  multiplied by \(\frac{9}{10}\) is always positive. Practically speaking, however, the insulin given to the patient
  will eventually disappear, unless a new dose is injected. The model also doesn’t account for any insulin that
  the body produces naturally. This is a good opportunity to remind students that mathematical models are simplified
  descriptions of reality.</p>

        That’s correct! Check yourself: The shape of the graph is exponential, it has a \(y\)-intercept of 1,
        and since it passes through (1, \(\frac13\)), it has a growth factor of \(\frac13\).

<h4>More Exponential Models</h4>
<p>The graph shows the amount of a chemical in a patient’s body at different times, measured in hours since the
  levels were first checked.</p>
<p>Could the amount of this chemical in the patient be decaying exponentially? Explain how you know.</p>
<img alt="A graph showing acetaminophen levels (mg) decreasing over 8 hours; starting at 1000 mg at 0 hours, dropping to 750 mg at 1 hour, 562.5 mg at 2 hours, and continuing downward." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/6067169e5114ec7c6decefb23c92843d3d582b07"/><br/>
<p>The graph does seem to have the shape of exponential decay. To confirm if the chemical in the patient is decaying
  exponentially, you can find the growth factor. Since terms are usually multiplied by the growth factor, you can divide
  consecutive terms to see if there is the same growth factor each time.</p>
<p>Since \(\frac{600}{1000}=\frac{360}{600}=\frac{6}{10}\), the growth factor is \(\frac{6}{10}\). Therefore, it is
  decaying exponentially, and the equation is \(y = 1000 (\frac{6}{10})^x\), where \(y\) is the amount of chemical in mg
  in the patient and \(x\) is the time in hours.</p>
<p>As the time continues, the amount of chemical in the patient is approaching 0 mg. We can see this in the graph as the data points approach the \(x\)-axis where \(y = 0\). The equation of the line that the data points approach is called the asymptote. In this example it is \(y = 0\). </p>
<h4>Try It: More Exponential Models</h4>

  growth? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</p>

<p>Write down your answer. Then select the<strong> Solution </strong>button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution:</h5>
<p>Here is how to check the table to see if it represents an exponential relationship:</p>
<p>Just like the values of a graph, you can divide consecutive terms to find the growth factor. If each set of
  consecutive terms has the same ratio, the relationship is exponential. In this situation, dividing consecutive terms
  results in \(\frac{600}{300}=\frac{1200}{600}=\frac{2400}{1200}=2\). Therefore, the situation represents exponential
  growth and can also be represented by the equation \(y= 300(2)^x\), where \(y\) is the number of people who have read
  a book and \(x\) is the number of months.</p>
