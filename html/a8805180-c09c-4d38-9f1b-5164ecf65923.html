<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students continue to make sense of their earlier observations about the connection between the factored form of a quadratic expression and the \(x\)-intercepts of its graph. They study two very similar expressions: x(x+4) and x(x-4). They evaluate each at different \(x\)-values. The expressions are chosen so that students can shift their focus from the numbers to the operations, attending to precision along the way.</p>
<p>Students notice that for \(x(x+4)\), the \(x\)-values that produce a 0 output are 0 and -4, and for \(x(x-4)\), those values are 0 and 4. This helps to explain why the signs of the \(x\)-intercepts are the opposite of the signs in the factors. In an upcoming unit, they will further develop this understanding algebraically, in terms of the zero product property. For now, it suffices that they verify the \(x\)-intercepts by evaluating the quadratic expression at the predicted values and checking that the outputs are 0.</p>
<p>Students also observe, by looking for regularity in repeated reasoning, that the horizontal location of the vertex of the graph can be identified once the \(x\)-intercepts are known: it is exactly halfway between the intercepts. This suggests that a quadratic expression in factored form can help us "see" both the \(x\)-coordinates of the \(x\)-intercepts and the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex of the graph. Some students may notice the horizontal location of the vertex could be determined using the halfway point between any two points with the same \(y\)-coordinate because the graphs have reflection symmetry across a vertical line through the vertex.</p>
<p>As students work, look for those who use the table to determine the \(x\)-intercepts, rather than by plotting the points first. Invite those students to share their strategy during the synthesis.</p>
<p>In this activity, students are generalizing the relationship between the zeros on the graph of a function and the factored form of the function so technology is not an appropriate tool.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Display for all to see the equations defining \(f\) and \(g\):</p>
<p>\(f(x)=x(x+4)\) and \(g(x)=x(x-4)\)</p>
<p>Poll the class to gather some predictions about the graphs that represent the two functions and display the results for all to see:</p>
<ul>
  <li> In what ways would the graphs be alike? </li>
  <li> In what ways would they be different? </li>
</ul>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Ask partners to split the work on the first question (with one person analyzing function \(f\) and the other person analyzing function \(g\)) and then working together to plot the points and make observations in the last question.</p>
<p>If needed, remind students that the vertex of a graph is the point at which the graph changes direction from increasing to decreasing, or from decreasing to increasing.</p>
<p>Since this activity was designed to be completed without technology, ask students to put away any devices.</p>
<p>If desired, distribute coordinate grids (or graph paper) and colored pencils so that each student has access to two different colors for creating their graphs in the last question.</p>

<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li> The \(x\)-intercept of both graphs is at \((0,0)\). </li>
  <li> The graphs seem to be a reflection of each other across the \(y\)-axis. </li>

</ul>
<h4> Activity Synthesis </h4>
<p>Discuss how students use the completed tables to help them find the \(x\)-intercepts and the vertex of each graph. If not already mentioned in students' explanations, highlight that:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The \(x\)-values that produce 0 for the output are the zeros of the function. They tell us where the graph intersects the \(x\)-axis. For \(f(x)=x(x+4)\), those values are 0 and -4, so the \(x\)-intercepts are \((0,0)\) and \((-4,0)\). For \(g(x)=x(x-4)\), those values are 0 and 4, so the \(x\)-intercepts are \((0,0)\) and \((-4,0)\). </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li> The vertex tells us the point where the function reaches its maximum or minimum value. We can see the minimum value in each table. In the first table, \(f(-2)\) is the lowest value. Because the values on one side of \(f(-2)\) mirror those on the other, we can reason that -4 is the lowest value of the function \(f\). In the second table, \(g(2)\) is the lowest value. </li>
  <li> The vertex is halfway between each pair of \(x\)-intercepts. </li>
</ul>
<p>If time permits, consider asking students how they think the graphs of the functions given by \(p(x)=(x-1)(x-3)\) and \(q(x)=(x+1)(x+3)\) will compare.</p>
<ul>
  <li> "Where will their \(x\)-intercepts be?" (\((1,0)\) and \((3,0)\) for the graph of function \(p\), and \((-1,0)\) and \((-3,0)\) for the graph of function \(q\).) </li>
  <li> "Where will the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex of each graph be?" (2 for the graph of \(p\) and -2 for that of \(q\).) </li>
  <li> "How do we find the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex?" (Evaluate \(p(2)\) and \(q(-2)\).) </li>
  <li> "The \(y\)-intercept of both graphs is \((0,3)\). What is another point on each graph with the same \(y\)-coordinate?" (The point 2 units to the right of the vertex of \(p\) will have the same \(y\)-coordinate, so \((4,3)\). The point (-4,3) is on the graph of \(q\).) </li>
</ul>
<p>Clarify that a table of values won't always show the maximum or minimum values of a function. It also won't always help us identify the \(x\)-intercepts of a graph or the zeros of a quadratic function, especially if the zeros are not integers or the given expressions are more complex. Students will learn other ways to find the zeros of any function in another unit later in the course.</p>

<p>Here is how to determine the vertex from the table:</p>
<p>The zeros are located at \((5, 0)\) and \((9, 0)\).
  The vertex will be halfway between the two zeros. This occurs at \(x = 7\).</p>
<p>The point in the table at \(x = 7\) is \((7, 8)\).</p>
<p>This is the vertex.</p>
