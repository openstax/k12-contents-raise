          The equation&nbsp;\( 4(x-2) = 100 \)&nbsp;is a true equation for a particular value of&nbsp;\( x \). Explain why&nbsp;\( 2(x-2) = 50 \)&nbsp;is also true for the same value of&nbsp;\( x \). 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
      <p>Compare your answer:<br>If&nbsp;\( 4(x&minus;2) \) and 100 are equal, then multiplying&nbsp;\( 4(x&minus;2) \) by \( \frac{1}{2}\) and multiplying 100 by \( \frac{1}{2} \) will give two results that are also equal, so \( 2(x&minus;2)=50 \) must be true.</p>

      <p>Use the following information for questions 2 and 3.<p>
      <p>To solve the equation \( 7.5d=2.5d \), Lin divides each side by \( 2.5d \), and Elena subtracts \( 2.5d \) from each side.</p>

          Will both moves lead to the solution? Be prepared to show your reasoning.

      </ol>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
      <p>Compare your answer:</p>
      <p>No. For example: Lin's move won't work. Dividing by \( 2.5d \) gives \( 3=1 \), which is not true. Dividing by the variable we are trying to solve makes us think there is no solution. Subtracting \( 2.5d \) from both sides gives \( 5d=0 \).</p>
