          <li>The equation <span class="math math-repaired">\( 4(x-2) = 100 \)</span> is a true equation for a particular value of <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span>. Explain why <span class="math math-repaired">\( 2(x-2) = 50 \)</span> is also true for the same value of <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span>.
          </li>
          <li>To solve the equation <span class="math">\( 7.5d=2.5d \)</span>, Lin divides each side by <span class="math math-repaired">\( 2.5d \)</span>, and Elena subtracts <span class="math math-repaired">\( 2.5d \)</span> from each side.

      <h3>Student Response</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
          <li>If <span class="math math-repaired">\( 4(x-2) \)</span> and 100 are equal, then multiplying <span class="math math-repaired">\( 4(x-2) \)</span> by <span class="math math-repaired">\( \frac12 \)</span> and multiplying 100 by <span class="math math-repaired">\( \frac12 \)</span> will give two results that are also equal, so <span class="math math-repaired">\( 2(x-2)=50 \)</span> must be true.</li>
          <li>
            <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
            </ol>
            <ul>
              <li>No. For example: Lin&rsquo;s move won&rsquo;t work. Dividing by <span class="math math-repaired">\( 2.5d \)</span> gives <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3=1 \)</span>, which is not true. Dividing by the variable we are trying to solve for makes us think there is no solution.</li>
              <li><span class="math math-repaired">\( d=0 \)</span></li>

        <h3>Response to Student Thinking</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="body">
        <h4>Points to Emphasize</h4>Address student misconceptions about dividing by a variable at the beginning of the next lesson. If students struggle with division in the first part of the cool-down, look for moments to emphasize the procedure of doing the same thing to both sides in Lessons 1.8 and 1.9.
