<p>Here are three patterns of dots.</p>
<p>Pattern A</p>
<p><img alt="A pattern of dots. Step 0 has no dots. Step 1 has a column of 2 dots. Step 2 has two columns of 2 dots. Step 3 has three columns of 2 dots." height="96" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/194e1b67c3ffd41194a6988591af6534b3030885" width="365"/></p>
<p>Pattern B</p>
<p><img alt="A pattern of dots. Step 0 has 1 dot. Step 1 has a row of 2 dots. Step 2 has 2 rows of dots. In the bottom row are 3 dots and in the top row are 2 dots.

Row 2 has 3 dots and row 3 has 3 dots." height="110" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/195f89d68ad7960983a0a610fb34162825a1ef6e" width="365"/></p>
<p>Pattern C</p>
<p><img alt="A pattern of dots. Step 0 has 1 dot. Step 1 has a row of 3 dots. Step 2 has 3 rows of 3 dots. Step 3 has 3 rows of 9 dots." height="110" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c5b538a1b4584d059bc5042f1366aa61bd9ba29b" width="461"/></p>
<p>Which pattern shows a quadratic relationship between the step number and the number of dots? Explain how you know algebraically and in complete sentences. </p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Pattern B shows a quadratic relationship.Â </p>
<ul>
<li> The number of dots is the step number squared plus 1, or \(n^2+1\). </li>
<li> Pattern A is growing linearly. It is growing by 2 each time. Pattern C is growing by a factor of 3 each time, so it is growing exponentially. </li>
<li> Pattern B is growing by 1, then by 3, and then by 5, which is the pattern we saw in other examples of quadratic relationships in the lesson. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
