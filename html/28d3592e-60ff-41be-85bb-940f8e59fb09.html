<p>Some key takeaways from this lesson are the ideas that real-life situations are often represented by systems of equations. Systems, like other equations, can be represented by tables, graphs, and verbal descriptions.</p>
<p>To help students see these points, discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> How are the solutions to systems of equations connected to the graph of the system? </li>
  <li> How can you find the solution to a system of equations using tables? </li>
  <li> Can you think of any other situations that can be modeled by systems of equations? </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell students that expressions, equations, and inequalities are mathematical models. A model is a mathematical representation of a real-life situation. When people create models, they rely on the information they have, but they also make assumptions and decisions that affect the models. If the information or assumptions change, the model would also change.</p>
<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
