<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>Your teacher will give you a set of cards containing descriptions of situations and graphs. Match each situation with a graph that represents it. Record your matches and be prepared to explain your reasoning.</p>
<p>Use the cards to answer questions 1&ndash;4. Match each graph representation to the description of the situation characterized by exponential change. Then choose the relationship between the number of years since purchase and the value.</p>
