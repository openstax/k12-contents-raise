<h4>Cool-Down (5 minutes)<br><br></h4>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<p dir="ltr">On the same coordinate grid:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Partner A draws a vertical line, and Partner B draws a horizontal line.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Each partner labels their line with its equation in slope-intercept form.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">Pass your paper to your partner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Check your partner&rsquo;s graph and equation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Draw a point on your partner&rsquo;s paper that is not on the line. Label the point \( P \).<br><br><span>3. Draw a line parallel to the original line that goes through point \( P \). Label the line with its equation.</span></p>
<p>4. Draw a line perpendicular to the original line that goes through point \( P \). Label the line with its equation.<br><span>Enter the equation here:</span></p>
<p>Share your graphs and equations with your partner. Decide if they are correct.</p>
<h4>Student Response</h4>

<p>1.&nbsp;<span>Partner A&rsquo;s equation is of the form \( x =\) #, and Partner B&rsquo;s equation is of the form \( y =\) #.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>2. Point&nbsp;\( P \) shouldn&rsquo;t be on the partner&rsquo;s initial line.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;</span><span>The equation of your line will depend on where you drew it on the coordinate grid, but it should have the same slope (0 or undefined) as the first equation.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;</span><span>The equation of your line will depend on where you drew it on the coordinate grid, but it should have a slope that is not the same as the first equation.</span></p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>The purpose of the discussion is to elicit conversation about equations of lines parallel or perpendicular to horizontal or vertical lines.</p>

<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;What do you notice about the equations of vertical lines?&rdquo; (They are of the form \( x = a&nbsp;\).)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;What do you notice about the equations of lines perpendicular to vertical lines?&rdquo; (They are of the form \(&nbsp;y = b&nbsp;\).)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;What do you notice about the equations of horizontal lines?&rdquo; (They are of the form \(&nbsp;y = b&nbsp;\).)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;What do you notice about the equations of lines perpendicular to horizontal lines?&rdquo; (They are of the form \(&nbsp;x = a&nbsp;\).)</li>
</ul>

<h4><span>Response to Student Thinking</span><br></h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>

<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p><br>
