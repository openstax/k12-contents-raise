<p dir="ltr">Han is about to mow some lawns in his neighborhood. His lawn mower has a 5-gallon fuel tank, but Han is not sure how much gasoline is in the tank.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He knows, however, that the lawn mower uses 0.4 gallon of gasoline per hour of mowing.</p>

<li>\(x\;\leq\;\frac5{0.4}\) or \(x\;\geq\;12.5\) and \(x\;\geq\;0\). If the tank is completely full, Han can mow for at most 12.5 hours without refilling. If it is completely empty, he can mow for 0 hours. It is not possible for Han to mow for a negative number of hours.</li>
