<p>The focus for this unit is on proactivity &mdash; the ability to connect with other people.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li> In the Unit 7 Overview and Readiness lesson, students will see an example of how this trait is modeled through a real-world scenario.&nbsp; </li>
  <li> In each lesson&rsquo;s Teacher Guide, you will be provided with links to tips that may help you foster this trait in students. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Why Does Proactivity Matter?</h4>
<p>Proactive people don&rsquo;t accept the world as it is or wait for direction from others to initiate change. Instead, they take matters into their own hands, acting to make the world better for themselves and others. They speak truth to power, take charge to solve problems, and champion new ideas. For instance, there&rsquo;s evidence that proactivity is one of the qualities that distinguished the greatest American presidents from their peers. And there&rsquo;s also evidence that it&rsquo;s a trait you can develop.</p>
<h4>How Do I Encourage Proactivity in My Students?</h4>
<p>Consider some of these suggestions for promoting proactivity in your classroom:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Model it. When something isn&rsquo;t working, question why. Replace &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the way we&rsquo;ve always done it&rdquo; with &ldquo;what if we tried it a different way?&rdquo; For example, if you think your street could use sprucing up, organize a block cleanup or a neighborhood flower planting. </li>
  <li> Celebrate it. Applaud proactivity when you see it to help others recognize the behavior and associate it with a positive response: &ldquo;I love how you dive into projects ahead of schedule and bring people together&mdash;I think you could organize a meeting of the American Association of Anarchists!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
  <li> Enable it. Invite young people to point out problems even if they don&rsquo;t have a solution. Ask a question and give everyone in the room a chance to answer, so they all have a voice. Criticize yourself out loud, which shows people you&rsquo;re open to being challenged. </li>
</ul>
