    Alan is loading a pallet with boxes that each weigh 45 pounds. The pallet can safely support no more than 900 pounds. How many boxes can he safely load onto the pallet?
  </li>
</ol>
<div>
  <p> ____ boxes or less</p>
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>20</p>
  <p>Each box weighs 45 pounds. The total amount of weight the pallet can support is 900 pounds.<br>
    Let \(b\) represent the number of boxes that can safely be loaded onto the pallet.<br>
    The equation is : 45b&le;900<br>
    Solve for \(b\) : b&le;20<br>
    The number of boxes that can be safely loaded onto the pallet is less than or equal to 20.

    The elevator in Yehire&rsquo;s apartment building has a sign that says the maximum weight is 2100 pounds. If the average weight of one person is 150 pounds, how many people can safely ride the elevator?

</ol>
<div>
  <p> a maximum of ___ people</p>
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>14</p>
    
    <p>An average person's weight is 150 pounds.  The total amount of weight the elevator can hold is 2100 pounds.<br>
      Let \(p\) represent the number of people that can safely ride the elevator at one time.<br>
      The equation is: 150p&le;2100
      Solve for \(p\): p&le;14
      The number of people that can safely ride the elevator at one time is less than or equal to 14.

  <li>
    Andre is looking at apartments with three of his friends. They want the monthly rent to be no more than $2,360. If the roommates split the rent evenly among the four of them, what is the maximum rent each will pay?
  </li>
</ol>
<div>
  <p> $____</p>
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>590</p>
  <p>
    There are 4 people that want to rent an apartment together.  The total amount they want to pay for rent per month is $2360.<br>
    Let \(r\) represent the amount of rent each person will pay.<br>
    The equation is: 4r&le;$2360 <br>
    Solve for \(r\): r&le;$590<br>
    Each of the 4 people will pay a maximum of $590 per month for rent to stay under the total amount of $2360.

  <li>
    Arleen got a $20 gift card for the coffee shop. Her favorite iced drink costs $3.79. What is the maximum number of drinks she can buy with the gift card?
  </li>
</ol>
<div>
  <p> ____ drinks</p>
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong> 5</p>
  <p>Each drink costs $3.79. The total amount she has to spend is $20.<br>
    Let \(d\) represent the number of drinks that can be purchased using the gift card.<br>
    The equation is: $3.79d&le;$20 <br>
    Solve for \(d\): d&le;5.28<br>
    She can buy a maximum of 5 drinks, which would cost $3.79 x 5 = $18.95.  That would leave $20 - $18.95 = $1.05 on the gift card, which is not enough to buy a 6th drink.</p>

    Teegan likes to play golf. He has budgeted $60 next month for the driving range. It costs him $10.55 for a bucket of balls each time he goes. What is the maximum number of times he can go to the driving range next month?
  </li>
</ol>
<div>
  <p> ____ times</p>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> 5</p>
  
    <p>Each bucket of balls costs $10.55.  His total budget for the month is $60.<br>
      Let \(n\) represent the number of times he can visit the driving range without going over his budget.<br>
      The equation is: $10.55n&le;$60 <br>
      Solve for \(n\): n&le;5.69<br>
      He can go to the range 5 times, which would cost $10.55 x 5 = $52.75. He would be under budget by $60 - $52.75 = $7.25, which is not enough money for a 6th trip to the range.</p>

    Ryan charges his neighbors $17.50 to wash their car. How many cars must he wash next summer if his goal is to earn at least $1500?
  </li>
</ol>
<div>
  <p> ____ cars</p>
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>86</p>
  <p>He charges $17.50 for each wash.  He wants to make at least $1500.<br>
    Let \(c\) represent the number of cars he has to wash to make at least $1500.<br>
    The equation is: $17.50c&le;$1500 <br>
    Solve for \(c\): c&le;85.71<br>
    He has to wash 86 cars to make at least $1500.  If he washes 85 cars he will make 85($17.50)=$1487.50, which is lower than his goal.  If he washes 86 cars he will make 86($17.50)=$1505, which is higher than his goal. </p>

    Jake&rsquo;s water bill is $24.80 per month plus $2.20 per ccf (hundred cubic feet) of water. What is the maximum number of ccf Jake can use if he wants his bill to be no more than $60?
  </li>
</ol>
<div>
  <p> ____ ccf</p>
  <p><strong><br>Answer: </strong>16</p>
  <p>He pays a flat monthly fee of $24.80 plus an additional cost of $2.20 per ccf that he uses each month. He wants his bill to be no more than $60.<br>
  Let \(w\) represent the amount of water he uses each month.<br>
  The equation is: $24.80+$2.20w&le;$60<br>
  Solve for \(w\): $2.20w&le;35.20<br>
  Solve for \(w\): w&le;16<br>
  He can use less than or equal to 16 ccf of water per month and keep his bill under $60.

  <li>
    Look at the inequality \(5m + 6 &lt; 14 - 2m\). Which of the following is NOT true?
    <ul>
      <li>If \(m\) is a negative number, then \(5m + 6\) could be a positive or negative number.</li>
      <li>If \(m\) is a negative number, then \(14 - 2m\) will always be positive.</li>
      <li>If \(m\) is a positive number, then \(5m + 6\) will always be positive.</li>
      <li>If \(m\) is a negative number, then \(14 - 2m\) will always be negative.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<div>
  <p><strong><br>Answer: </strong>If <em>m</em> is a negative number, then 14 &minus; 2m will always be negative</p>
  <p>
    Substitute in -1  and -2  for \(m\) to evaluate statement a.<br>
    \(5m+6\) <br>
    \(5(-1)+6=-5+6=1\)<br>
    \(5(-2)+6=-10+6=-5\)<br>
    Statement a is true because when \(m\) is -1, \(5m+6\)  is positive, but any negative number smaller than -1, will make it negative, so \(5m+6\) could be a positive or negative number.<br>
    <br>
    Substitute in  -1 for \(m\) to evaluate statement b.<br>
    \(14−2m\)<br>
    \(14-2(-1)=14+2=16\)<br>
    Statement b is true because when \(m\) is -1, \(14−2m\)  is positive, and any negative number would make the expression positive because subtracting a negative number always results in a positive number. <br>

    Substitute in 1 for \(m\) to evaluate statement c.<br>
    \(5m+6 \)<br>
    \(5(1)+6=5+6=11\)<br>
    Statement c is true. If \(m\) is a positive number, then any other positive number will make 5m+6 positive number.<br>
    <br>
    Because statement b is true for If \(m\) is a negative number, then \(14−2m\) will always be positive, statement d has to be false because \(14−2m\) can not be a negative number when \(m\) is negative.  <br>
    <br>
    Statement d is the false statement.
