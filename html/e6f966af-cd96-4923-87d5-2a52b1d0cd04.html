<p>Your answers may vary, but here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li> The graph cannot represent Description A because the phone is retaining only \(\frac15\) of its value, which is less than half, and the vertical coordinate of the second point on the graph is more than half of the vertical intercept. </li>
<li> If the camera loses \(\frac25\) of its value each year, then its value is \(\frac35\) that of the previous year. The vertical intercept seems to be 1,200, and \(\frac35\) of 1,200 is about 700, which is roughly the vertical coordinate of the second point. </li>
