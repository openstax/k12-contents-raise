<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>A flag ceremony is held at a Fourth of July event. The height of the flag is a function of time.</p>
<p>Here are some graphs that could each be a possible representation of the function.</p>

<li>Graph D: The flag starts out on the ground, is raised up a couple of meters, and then is lowered back to the ground. This happens repeatedly.</li>
<li>Graph E: The flag starts out at 0.5 meter above the ground and is raised up bit by bit, with a brief pause before it is raised farther.</li>
<li>Graph F: The flag starts out on the ground and is raised up at a constant speed for 3 seconds. It stops abruptly and comes back down at a constant speed. Then, 2 seconds later, it stops at 3 meters above the ground.</li>

<p>If we assume that time is measured in seconds and the height is measured in meters, this graph would not represent the height of a flag raised at a flag ceremony. The graph shows the flag being at all heights between 0 and 6 meters at the same time (3 seconds), which is impossible. </p>

      This graph does not represent a function. A function has only one output for every input. If we assume that time is measured in seconds and the height is measured in meters, this graph shows many possible outputs when the input is 3 seconds.

<h4>Extending Your Thinking </h4>
<p>Suppose an ant is moving at a rate of 1 millimeter per second and keeps going at that rate for a long time.
      If time, \(x\), is measured in seconds, then the distance the ant has traveled in millimeters, \(y\), is \(y=1x\). If time, \(x\), is measured in minutes, the distance in millimeters is \(y=60x\). </p>

<p>It could, depending on the unit of time being used and the scale of the horizontal and vertical axes. If the time is measured in months, for instance, each point on the graph could represent a time value that is just a tiny bit more than 3 months—say, 3 months and 1 second, 3 months and 2 seconds, and so on. A horizontal change of 1 second would not be visible when the horizontal units are measured in months, so all input-output pairs marking the height of the flag at each second would appear to be stacked exactly on top of one another.</p>
