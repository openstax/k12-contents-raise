<p>We studied quantities that decrease or decay by the same factor repeatedly. Use examples from activities in the lesson, or use a new example like this one. Here is a graph showing the amount, in mg, of a medicine in a person&rsquo;s body at different times, measured in hours after taking the medicine. Every hour, \(\frac25\) of the medicine is broken down by the body.</p>

<p>Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;What is the vertical intercept, and what does it mean in this context?&rdquo; (400. It is the milligrams of medicine in the person&rsquo;s body right after taking the pill.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;How can you tell from the graph that \(\frac25\) of the medicine is broken down after one hour?&rdquo; (The amount of medicine after 1 hour dropped by 160 mg, and 160 is \(\frac25\) of 400.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;How can you tell from the graph that \(\frac35\) remained after each hour?&rdquo; (240 is \(\frac35\) of 400, 144 is \(\frac35\) of 240, and so on.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;What is an equation representing the amount of medicine in mg, \(m\), \(t\)&nbsp;hours after taking the medicine?&rdquo; (\(m=400(\frac{3}{5} )^t)\)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Why does it make sense to write \((\frac{3}{5})^t\)?&rdquo; (\(\frac35\) of the medicine remained after every hour, so for \(t\) hours, we multiply the 400 by \(\frac35\), \(t\) times.) </li>
  <li>“What is the horizontal asymptote, and what does it mean in this context?” (\(y = 0\). As time progresses, the amount of medicine in a person’s body approaches 0 mg.)
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the day’s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
