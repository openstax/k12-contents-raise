<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm-up addresses a common confusion among students mistaking the expression \(2^x\) for the expression \(x^2\). One good way to address this confusion is by evaluating the expressions for different values of \(x\)<em>,</em> which is the path students are likely to take here. Another way to illustrate the distinction is by graphing, though students are less likely to take this approach.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Display the task for all to see and ask students to read it quietly to themselves. Ask what they think Lin means by <em>equivalent.</em> They may remember from earlier grades, or they may guess based on contrasting her statement with Diego&rsquo;s statement. Before they start working, be sure that students understand <em>equivalent </em>to mean equal no matter what value is used in place of \(x\).</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Lin and Diego are discussing two expressions: \(x^2\) and \(2^x\).</p>
<p>Lin says, &ldquo;I think the two expressions are equivalent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diego says, &ldquo;I think the two expressions are only equal for some values of \(x\).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do you agree with either of them? Explain or show your reasoning.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;I agree with Diego. Sample explanation: If we find the value of \(x^2\) and \(2^x\) for different values of \(x\),&nbsp;say 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can see that they are not always equal. As the table shows, they are only equal sometimes, for example, when \(x\)&nbsp;is 2 and 4.</p>

<p>Possible questions for discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;For what values of \(x\)&nbsp;are the two expressions equal?&rdquo; (when \(x\)&nbsp;is 2 and when \(x\)&nbsp;is 4) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;Besides substituting different values of \(x\), are there other ways to tell if the two expressions are equal for all values of \(x\)&nbsp;or only some values of \(x\)?&rdquo; (One way might be to think about possible values the expressions could take when \(x\)&nbsp;is an odd number. \(2^x\) means 2 multiplied by itself \(x\)<em>&nbsp;</em>times. When \(x\)<em>&nbsp;</em>is an odd number, the value of \(2^x\) will be even because of the multiplication by 2. But multiplying an odd-number \(x\)&nbsp;by itself, as in \(x^2\), will result in an odd number, so we know that in those instances the expressions are not equal. Another way might be to graph the equations \(y=x^2\) and \(y=2^x\) on the same coordinate plane and examine the graphs.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;Which expression grows more quickly?&rdquo; (For positive values of \(x\),&nbsp;\(2^x\) grows much more quickly than \(x^2\).) </li>
</ul>
