<h4>Using Key Points to Graph Quadratics</h4>
<p>We saw that vertex form is especially helpful for finding the vertex of a graph of a quadratic function. For example,
  we can tell that the function \(p\) given by \(p(x)=(x-3)^2+1\) has a vertex at \((3,1)\).</p>

<p>We also noticed that, when the squared expression \((x-3)^2\) has a positive coefficient, the graph opens upward.
  This means that the vertex \((3,1)\) represents the minimum function value.</p>
<p>But why does the function \(p\) take on its minimum value when \(x\) is 3?</p>
<p>Here is one way to explain it: When \(x=3\), the squared term \((x-3)^2\) equals 0, as \((3-3)^2=0^2=0\). When \(x\)
  is any other value besides 3, the squared term \((x-3)^2\) is a positive number greater than 0. (Squaring any number
  results in a positive number.) This means that the output when \(x \neq 3\) will always be greater than the output
  when \(x=3\), so the function \(p\) has a minimum value at \(x=3\).</p>
<p>This table shows some values of the function for some values of \(x\). Notice that the output is the least when
  \(x=3\) and it increases both as \(x\) increases and as it decreases.</p>

<p>The squared term sometimes has a negative coefficient, for instance: \(h(x)=-2(x+4)^2\). The \(x\) value that makes
  \((x+4)^2\) equal 0 is -4, because \((-4+4)^2=0^2=0\). Any other \(x\) value makes \((x+4)^2\) greater than 0. But
  when \((x+4)^2\) is multiplied by a negative number (-2), the resulting expression, \(-2(x+4)^2\), ends up being
  negative. This means that the output when \(x-4\) will always be less than the output when \(x=-4\), so the function
  \(h\) has its maximum value when \(x=-4\).</p>

<p>Remember that we can find the \(y\)-intercept of the graph representing any function we have seen. The
  \(y\)-coordinate of the \(y\)-intercept is the value of the function when \(x=0\). If \(g\) is defined by
  \(g(x)=(x+1)^2-5\), then the \(y\)-intercept is \((0,-4)\) because \(g(0)=(0+1)^2-5=-4\). Its vertex is at
  \((-1,-5)\). Another point on the graph with the same \(y\)-coordinate is located the same horizontal distance from
  the vertex but on the other side.</p>

  <p>Here is how to find another point on the curve:</p>
  <p>One way to find another point on the curve is to use symmetry.</p>
  <p>Since the vertex is \((-3, -5)\) and one point on the curve is \((5, 61)\), there is another point on the other
    side of the vertex. Keep in mind, the \(y\)-coordinate will remain at 61. To find the \(x\)-coordinate, we need to
    determine how far apart horizontally the vertex and the other point are located from each other. There are 8 units
    from -3 to 5, so the new point will also be 8 units from -3 but to the left. Thus, the \(x\)-coordinate will be at
    -11. So, there is another point at \((-11, 61)\).</p>
