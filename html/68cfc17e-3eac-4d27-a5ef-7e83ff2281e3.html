<h4>Lesson Narrative </h4>
<div>
  <p>In a previous lesson, students learned that the
    solutions to a system of linear inequalities can be represented graphically
    with overlapping regions.</p>
  <p>In this lesson, students take a closer look at
    whether points on the boundary lines of the system&rsquo;s solution region are
    included in the solutions. Analyzing graphs and communicating observations
    about them require attention to precision. Students also apply these insights
    to solve more challenging contextual problems. This work involves making sense
    of the information needed to solve the problems.</p>
</div>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher
  Facing) </h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li><span>Analyze given information about a situation
        involving multiple constraints to determine what additional information is
        needed to solve problems.</span></li>
    <li>Explain (orally and in writing) how to tell if a
      pair of values is a solution to the system, given a system of inequalities and
      their graphs.</li>
    <li>Practice writing systems of inequalities in two
      variables and finding the solution sets by reasoning or by graphing.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing) </h4>
<ul>
  <li>Explain how to tell if a point on the boundary of the
    graph of the solutions to a system of inequalities is a solution.</li>
</ul>
