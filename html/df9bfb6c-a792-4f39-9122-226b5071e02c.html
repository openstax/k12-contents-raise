<p>In this lesson, students interpreted graphs and reasoned about their equations. Show the graph of \(y=f(x)\) for an
  exponential function \(f\) with some points labeled.</p>

<p>Tell students that the \(x\)-coordinate of \(Q\) is 1, and the \(x\)-coordinate of \(R\) is 2. Ask students what
  information would give us insight into the situation and help us write an equation corresponding to the graph.</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;What do you need to know to describe how the function is decreasing?&rdquo; (coordinates of two of the
    labeled points) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;If you could find out the coordinates of two of these points, which two would you choose? Why?&rdquo;
    (\(P\) and \(Q\) or \(Q\) and \(R\) because the quotient of their \(y\)-coordinates gives the growth factor.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;How would you find the equation using these two coordinates?&rdquo; (Use the \(y\)-coordinate of \(P\) and
    the growth factor.) </li>
</ul>
<p>Consider showing the graph of \(y=f(x)\) along with the graph of \(y=g(x)\) for another exponential function \(g\).

<p>Ask students to compare the two functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Which function is decreasing faster? How do you know?&rdquo; (\(g\) because it has a larger \(y\)-intercept
    than \(f\) but then takes smaller values than \(f\) as \(x\)&nbsp;grows) </li>
  <li> (If the graphs cross) &ldquo;What does the intersection of the two graphs mean?&rdquo; (The outputs of \(f\) and
    \(g\) are the same for this value of \(x\).) </li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
