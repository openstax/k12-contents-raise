<p>In this lesson, students interpreted graphs and reasoned about their equations. Show the graph of \(y=f(x)\) for an exponential function \(f\) with some points labeled.</p>

<p>Tell students that the \(x\)-coordinate of \(Q\) is 1, and the \(x\)-coordinate of \(R\) is 2. Ask students what information would give us insight into the situation and help us write an equation corresponding to the graph.</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;What do you need to know to describe how the function is decreasing?&rdquo; (coordinates of two of the labeled points) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;If you could find out the coordinates of two of these points, which two would you choose? Why?&rdquo; (\(P\) and \(Q\) or \(Q\) and \(R\) because the quotient of their \(y\)-coordinates gives the growth factor.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;How would you find the equation using these two coordinates?&rdquo; (Use the \(y\)-coordinate of \(P\) and the growth factor.) </li>
</ul>
<p>Consider showing the graph of \(y=f(x)\) along with the graph of \(y=g(x)\) for another exponential function \(g\).</p>

<p>Ask students to compare the two functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Which function is decreasing faster? How do you know?&rdquo; (\(g\) because it has a larger \(y\)-intercept than \(f\) but then takes smaller values than \(f\) as \(x\)&nbsp;grows) </li>
  <li> (If the graphs cross) &ldquo;What does the intersection of the two graphs mean?&rdquo; (The outputs of \(f\) and \(g\) are the same for this value of \(x\).) </li>
</ul>
