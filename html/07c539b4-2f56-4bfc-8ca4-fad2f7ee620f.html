<h3>Activity (10 minutes)</h3>
<p>The purpose of this task is to provide students with practice working with geometric sequences and identifying the common ratio of a sequence.</p>
<p>For each sequence, invite a student to share how they completed the sequence and determined the common ratio. Highlight the method of dividing any term by the previous term to find the common ratio. Emphasize that the presence of a common ratio is what makes a sequence a geometric sequence.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>In the lead up to writing recursive definitions for sequences, it is important for students to understand that for geometric sequences, the common ratio is defined to be the multiplier from one term to the next. Said another way, the common ratio is the quotient of a term and the previous term. For example, many students will want to say that the pattern of the third sequence is &ldquo;divide by 10 each time.&rdquo; This is true, but the common ratio is \(\frac1{10}\).</p>

<h4>Finding a Common Ratio</h4>
<h5>Definition of a Geometric Sequence</h5>
<p>A geometric sequence is one in which any term divided by the previous term is a constant. This constant is called the common ratio of the sequence. The common ratio can be found by dividing any term in the sequence by the previous term. If \(a_1\) is the initial term of a geometric sequence and \(r\) is the common ratio, the sequence will be</p>
<p>{\(a_1, a_1\cdot r, a_1\cdot r^2, a_1\cdot r^3\), . . .}</p>
<p>How to:</p>
<p>Given a set of numbers, determine if they represent a geometric sequence.</p>
<p>1. Divide each term by the previous term.</p>
<p>2. Compare the quotients. If they are the same, a common ratio exists and the sequence is geometric.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Is the sequence geometric? If so, find the common ratio.</p>
<p>a. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, . . .</p>
<p>b. 48, 12, 4, 2, . . .</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>
    Is a geometric sequence. Each term is multiplied by 2, so 2 is the common ratio.
  </li>
  <li>
    This is not geometric because each term is not multiplied by the same constant. There is not a common ratio.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Try It: Finding a Common Ratio</h4>
<p>Is the sequence geometric? If so, find the common ratio.</p>
<p>100, 20, 4, \(\frac45\), . . .</p>
<p>In your notebook, write down your answer. Then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to check your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to determine if the sequence is geometric:</p>
<p>Each term is \(\frac15\) of the previous term. So, the common ratio is \(\frac15\), and this is a geometric sequence.</p>
