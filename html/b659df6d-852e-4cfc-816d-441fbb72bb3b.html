<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Acetaminophen is a common pain reliever and fever reducer. Here is a graph showing the amount of acetaminophen, in milligrams, in an adult&rsquo;s body at different times after they take a normal dose.</p>

  <li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li> What is the vertical intercept?<br><br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> 1,000
      </li>
      <br>
      <li> What does it mean in this situation? <br><br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> There are 1,000 mg of acetaminophen in the person&rsquo;s body after taking the medicine (this is the dose size).
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> What fraction of the medicine remained after one hour? <br><br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(\frac34\) of the medicine remained after 1 hour since \(\frac{750}{1000}=\frac{3}{4}\).
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> Write an equation that represents the amount of medicine, \(a\), after \(t\) hours. <br><br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(a=1,000(\frac{3}{4})^t\)
  </li>
</ol>

<h4> Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5> Points to emphasize</h5>
<p>If students are still struggling with writing equations to represent exponential growth or decay, highlight a few examples from cool-downs and use practice problems from this lesson to provide further opportunities to examine the meaning of \(a\) and \(b\) terms and to practice writing equations to represent exponential decay.</p>
