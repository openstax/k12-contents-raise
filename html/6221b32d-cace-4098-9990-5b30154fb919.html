<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students revisit some situations that can be modeled with quadratic functions. They analyze and interpret given equations, write equations to represent relationships and constraints, and work to solve these equations. In doing so, students see that sometimes solutions to quadratic equations cannot be easily or precisely found by graphing or reasoning.</p>
<p>In an earlier unit, students saw that when a function is defined by a quadratic expression in factored form, the zeros of the function could be easily identified. Here, they notice that when a quadratic equation is written as factored form = 0, solving the equation is also relatively simple. This revelation motivates upcoming work on rewriting quadratic expressions into factored form.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Recognize the limitations of certain strategies used to solve a quadratic equation. </li>
  <li> Explain that the factored form of a quadratic expression can help us find the zeros of a quadratic function and solve a quadratic equation. </li>
  <li> Write quadratic equations and reason about their solutions in terms of a situation. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Recognize the factored form of a quadratic expression and know when it can be useful for solving problems. </li>
  <li> Use a graph to find the solutions to a quadratic equation but also know its limitations. </li>
</ul>

<h4> Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<div>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS.  The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.<br>&nbsp;<br>
	<ul>
	 <li>A1(E) internalize new basic and academic language by using and reusing it in meaningful ways in speaking and writing activities that build concept and language attainment</li>
	<li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
	<li>A3(D) speak using grade-level content area vocabulary in context to internalize new English words and build academic language proficiency </li>
	<li>A3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions</li>
