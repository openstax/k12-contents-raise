<p>Some key takeaways from this lesson are the ideas that real-life situations can be represented by linear equations and linear equations can be written from a variety of representations.</p>
<p>To help students see these points, discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> How can you find the slope of a line from the points in a table of values? </li>
  <li> Did you notice any patterns when matching the cards in the card sort? </li>
  <li> Could you create a table of values for any equation? </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell students that expressions, equations, and inequalities are mathematical models. A model is a mathematical representation of a real-life situation. When people create models, they rely on the information they have, but they also make assumptions and decisions that affect the models. If the information or assumptions change, the model would also change. </p>
<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
