<h4>Activity (30 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity is provided in case an additional activity is needed to reinforce the lesson goal. Alternatively, if
  students are familiar with the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, use this activity instead, and use the structure of the launch
  and discussion for the Tower of Hanoi activity for the discussion of this activity.</p>
<p>This activity works best when each student has access to manipulatives or devices that can run the GeoGebra applet
  because students will benefit from seeing the relationship in a dynamic way. If students don&rsquo;t have individual
  access, projecting the applet during the launch is helpful.</p>
<p>Monitor for students writing clear explanations for Noah&rsquo;s reasoning and for the number of moves needed for 7
  checkers on each side to share during the discussion.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Students can use the embedded applet below.</p>
<p>Ask students to read the rules to the puzzle and then give them time to solve the puzzle when there are 3 spaces and
  1 checker on each side. Remind them they need to keep track of the number of moves needed since the goal is to find
  the smallest number of moves. Encourage groups to check in with those around them to see if anyone found a solution
  with fewer moves. Before groups begin work on the rest of the questions, select a student to demonstrate, using the
  applet, why it takes 3 moves to solve the puzzle when there are 3 spaces and 1 checker on each side as a check that
  everyone understands the rules of the game.</p>

<p>Some checkers are lined up, with blue on one side, red on the other, and 1 empty space between them. A move in this
  checker game pushes any checker forward 1 space, or jumps over any 1 checker of the other color. Jumping the same
  color is not allowed, moving backward is not allowed, and 2 checkers cannot occupy the same space.</p>

<p>You complete the puzzle by switching the colors completely: ending up with black on the right, red on the left, and 1
  empty space between them.</p>

  <li> Using 1 checker on each side, complete the puzzle. What is the smallest number of moves needed?</li>

  <li> Noah says he used the solution for 3 checkers on each side to help him solve the puzzle for 4 checkers. Describe
    how this might happen. </li>
  <p> <strong>Answer: </strong> For example: The moves that don&rsquo;t involve the fourth checker on each side are the
    same as before, so it is possible to decide the number of moves by running the first half of the three-checker game,
    then moving the fourth checkers, and then running the second half. </p>
  <li> How many moves do you think it will take to complete a puzzle with 7 checkers on each side? </li>
  <p> <strong>Answer: </strong> 63 moves </p>
</ol>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may incorrectly interpret the rules or presume that there is no better solution once they find one solution
  that works. Encourage groups to regularly switch who is in charge of moving the checkers and to check with other
  groups around them once they think they have found a solution with the smallest number of moves.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students to share the smallest number of moves they found for 2, 3, and 4 checkers on each side. Each time,
  ask whether anyone in the class solved it with fewer moves. If no one finds the minimal solution, ask students to keep
  looking if time allows, or share the minimum number of moves and challenge them to do it, or demonstrate the minimal
  solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Invite previously identified students to share their explanation for Noah&rsquo;s strategy and the number of moves
  needed to complete a puzzle with 3 checkers on each side. The bottom row of the table should now have the numbers 3,
  8, 15, and 24 filled in.</p>
<p>If this activity was used instead of the Tower of Hanoi, make sure to define &ldquo;sequence&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;term&rdquo; for students before inviting students to describe a rule for the next term in the pattern. After a
  brief quiet time to think individually, select 2&ndash;3 students to share their thinking and write down any notation
  they come up with to describe the recursive rule, such as &ldquo;first add 5, and then keep adding the next odd
  number.&rdquo; There is no need to introduce formal notation or discuss a specific rule for finding term \(n\) at this
  time, but if students suggest these (time permitting), welcome their explanations.</p>

        Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: This is the number of skips needed with 5 checkers. The

      <td>
        That&rsquo;s correct! Check yourself: In every column, the number of checkers is multiplied by 2 more than
        the number in the previous column. 6 will be multiplied by 12, which results in 72 moves.

      <td>
        128
      </td>
      <td>
        Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: This assumes the number of skips needed started to double,
        which is not the case. The answer is 72.

      <td>

        Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: This did not change the number being multiplied by each
        time and kept multiplying the number of checkers by 8. The answer is 72.

<p>What is the pattern that you used in the previous activity to find the number of moves depending on the number of
  checkers?</p>
<p>Each row is multiplied by 1 more, so:</p>
<p>\(1\cdot3=3\)</p>
<p>\(2\cdot4=8\)</p>
<p>\(3\cdot5=15\)</p>
<p>\(4\cdot6=24\)</p>
<p>How many moves are needed with 5 checkers?</p>
<p>\(5\cdot7=35\) moves</p>
<p>What about 6 checkers?</p>
<p>\(6\cdot8=48\) moves</p>
<h4>Try It: Using a Table to Find Missing Values</h4>
<p>Using the table and the pattern, how many moves are needed with 8 checkers?</p>
<p>Write down your answer. Then select the<strong> Solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to solve this problem using a general strategy:</p>
<p>The next column in the table had 7 checkers and then multiplied 7 by 9 to get 63 moves.</p>
<p>Next, the 8 would need to be multiplied by 10, so:</p>
<p>\(8\cdot10=80\)</p>
<p>80 moves are needed.</p>
