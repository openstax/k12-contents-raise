<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
  <p>The purpose of this warm up is to help students recall what it means for two expressions to be equivalent. The given expressions are in forms that are unfamiliar to students but are not difficult to evaluate for integer values of the variable. This is by design—to pique students’ curiosity while keeping the mathematics accessible.
  </p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
  <p>Assign the first expression to one half of the class and the second expression to the other half. Give students a couple of minutes to evaluate their assigned expression for the values of \( n \)&nbsp;listed in the first question.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
  <p>Your teacher will assign you one of these expressions:</p>
  <p>\( \dfrac {n^2 - 9}{2(4-3)}\qquad \text{or} \qquad (n+3)\cdot \dfrac {n-3}{8-3\cdot2} \)</p>
  <p>For numbers 1 - 4, evaluate your expression when \(n\) is the given value.</p>
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li>\(n = 5\)</li>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 8</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>\(n = 7\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 20</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent"  start="3">
  <li>\(n = 13\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 80</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>\(n = -1\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> -4</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>What did you discover when you compared your answers? Explain your rationale.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. <br>
  Even though our questions were different, the answers were the same because the expressions were equivalent. 
  </p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
  <p>When evaluating their expression, some students may perform the operations in an incorrect order. For example, when finding the value of \( 8-3\cdot 2 \) in the second expression, they may find \( 8-3 \) and then multiply by 2. Ask them whether the subtraction or multiplication should be performed first. Remind them about the order of operations as needed.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
  <p>Ask a few students from each group for their results. Then, ask students what they wonder about the results. Students are likely curious if the values of the two expressions will be the same for other values of \( n \). If they noticed that all the given values of \( n \) are odd numbers, they might wonder if even values of \( n \) would give the same result. If time permits, consider allowing students to try evaluating the expressions using a value of their choice.</p>
  <p>Discuss questions such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&ldquo;Were you surprised that these expressions have the same result for different values of \( n \)?&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;If (or when) you tried using other values of \( n \), what did you find?&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Do you think that the two expressions will have the same value no matter what value of \( n \) is used? How do you know?&rdquo;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Tell students that it would be impossible to check every value of \( n \) to see if the expressions would give the same value. There are, however, ways to show that these expressions must have the same value for any value of \( n \). We call expressions that are equal no matter what value we use for the variable <em>equivalent expressions</em><em>.</em></p>
  <p>Remind students that in middle school they had seen simpler equivalent expressions. For example, they know that \( 3(x + 5) \) is equivalent to \( 3x + 15 \) by the distributive property (without trying different values of \( x \)).</p>
  <p>Explain to students that they&rsquo;ll learn more about how to identify or write equivalent expressions and about equivalent equations in this unit.</p>
