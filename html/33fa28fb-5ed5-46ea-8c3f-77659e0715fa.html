<h4>Activity (18 minutes)</h4>
<p>Students have worked on finding lines that are parallel and perpendicular to other lines that have slopes that are defined and non-zero. In this activity, students will work to find lines that are parallel and perpendicular to the \( x \)- and \( y \)-axes. To do this, students must have an understanding of the coordinate system. They must understand that the \(y\)-axis is vertical and the \(x\)-axis is horizontal. They must also understand that a coordinate is written in the form \( (x, y) \).</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Put students in pairs to work on this activity. Give each student a coordinate grid. A straight-edge and colored pencils would also help students visualize the different types of lines and their relationships.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>The line&nbsp;\( x = 5 \) and the point \(&nbsp;(3, -2)&nbsp;\) are shown on the graph.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>The purpose of the discussion is to elicit conversation about slopes of horizontal lines, vertical lines, parallel lines, and perpendicular lines. Here are some questions for discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;How did you find the slope of line \(l\)?&rdquo; (Vertical lines have undefined slope.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How does the slope of line \(m\) compare to line \(l\)?&rdquo; (They are the same because the lines are parallel.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How does the slope of line \(n\) compare to line \(l\)?&rdquo; (The slope of line \(n\) is zero because it is a horizontal line. The slope of line \(l\) is undefined because it is a vertical line.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How do you write the equation of a horizontal line with coordinates \((a, b)\)?&rdquo; \((y = b)\)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How do you write the equation of a vertical line with coordinates \((a, b)\)?&rdquo; \((x = a)\)</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.14.4: Additional Resources&nbsp;</h4>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold"><em>The following content is available to students who would like more support based on their experience with the self check. Students will not automatically have access to this content, so you may wish to share it with those who could benefit from it.</em></p>
<br>
<h4>Find Equations of Lines Perpendicular to an Axis</h4>
<br>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Find an equation of a line perpendicular to \(&nbsp;x=5&nbsp;\) that contains the point \(&nbsp;(3,-2)&nbsp;\). Write the equation in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p>Again, since we know one point, the point-slope option seems more promising than the slope-intercept option. We need the slope to use this form, and we know the new line will be perpendicular to \(&nbsp;x=5&nbsp;\). This line is vertical, so its perpendicular will be horizontal. This tells us the \(&nbsp;m_1=0&nbsp;\).<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Identify the point.<br>
  \( (3,-2) \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Identify the slope of the perpendicular line.<br>
  \(&nbsp;m_1=0&nbsp;\)&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Substitute the values into&nbsp;\(&nbsp;y-y_1=m(x-x_1)&nbsp;\).<br>
  \(&nbsp;\begin{array}{rcl}y-y_1&amp;=&amp;m(x-x_1) \\  y-(-2)&amp;=&amp;0(x-3)\end{array} \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Simplify<br>
  \( \begin{array}{rcl}y+2&amp;=&amp;0 \\ y&amp;=&amp;-2\end{array} \)</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Find an equation of a line that is perpendicular to&nbsp;\( y=4 \) that contains the point \(&nbsp;(2,3)&nbsp;\). Write the equation in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p>The line \(&nbsp;y=4 \) is a horizontal line. Any line perpendicular to it must be vertical, in the form \(&nbsp;x=a&nbsp;\). Since the perpendicular line is vertical and passes through \(&nbsp;(2,3)&nbsp;\), every point on it has an \(x\)-coordinate of 2. The equation of the perpendicular line is \(&nbsp;x=2 \).</p>
<h4>Try It: Find Equations of Lines Perpendicular to an Axis</h4>
<p>Find an equation of a line that is perpendicular to&nbsp;\( y = -3 \) that contains the point \( (-3, 5) \).</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Here is how to find the equation of a line perpendicular to&nbsp;\( y = -3 \) that contains the point \( (-3, 5) \).</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Find the slope of the given line.&nbsp;<br>
  The line is horizontal.<br>
  \( m = 0 \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Find the slope of the perpendicular line.<br>
  The perpendicular line is a vertical line.<br>
  undefined</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Identify the point.<br>
  The given point is \((-3, 5)\).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  \( (x_1, y_1) \)<br>
  \( (-3, 5) \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Write the equation.<br>
  The perpendicular line is vertical and passes through \( (-3, 5) \); every point on it has an \(x\)-coordinate of \( -3 \).&nbsp;<br>
  \( x = -3 \)</p>
