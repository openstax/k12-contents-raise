<h4>Activity (18 minutes)</h4>
<p>Students have worked on finding lines that are parallel and perpendicular to other lines that have slopes that are defined and non-zero. In this activity, students will work to find lines that are parallel and perpendicular to the \( x \)- and \( y \)-axes. To do this, students must have an understanding of the coordinate system. They must understand that the \(y\)-axis is vertical and the \(x\)-axis is horizontal. They must also understand that a coordinate is written in the form \( (x, y) \).</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Put students in pairs to work on this activity. Give each student a coordinate grid. A straight-edge and colored pencils would also help students visualize the different types of lines and their relationships.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>The purpose of the discussion is to elicit conversation about slopes of horizontal lines, vertical lines, parallel lines, and perpendicular lines. Here are some questions for discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>“How did you find the slope of line \(l\)?” (Vertical lines have undefined slope.)</li>
<li>“How does the slope of line \(m\) compare to line \(l\)?” (They are the same because the lines are parallel.)</li>
<li>“How does the slope of line \(n\) compare to line \(l\)?” (The slope of line \(n\) is zero because it is a horizontal line. The slope of line \(l\) is undefined because it is a vertical line.)</li>
<li>“How do you write the equation of a horizontal line with coordinates \((a, b)\)?” \((y = b)\)</li>
<li>“How do you write the equation of a vertical line with coordinates \((a, b)\)?” \((x = a)\)</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<h4>1.14.5: Additional Resources </h4>
<p>The following content is available to students who would like more support based on their experience with the self check. Students will not automatically have access to this content, so you may wish to share it with those who could benefit from it.</p>
<br/>
<h5>Find Equations of Lines Perpendicular to an Axis</h5>
<br/>
<p>Lines that are horizontal or vertical are special for two reasons. First, their equations have just one variable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Horizontal line \( y = b \); because all the \( y \)-coordinates are the same and the slope equals zero.</li>
<li>Vertical line \( x = a \); because all the \( x \)-coordinates are the same and the slope is undefined.</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, they have a special relationship with the x- and y-axes because they are either parallel or perpendicular to them.</p>
<p>Examine the line that passes through \((0, 4)\) and \((3, 4)\).</p>
<p><img alt="A graph with a horizontal line segment from (0, 4) to (3, 4) on the xy-plane. Arrows at both ends indicate the segment extends beyond these points. The grid is labeled from -1 to 5 on x and -1 to 7 on y." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c886e626d317cba95270bbbc6e0f4d5be8147467"/></p>
<p><strong>What is the rise?</strong> The rise is 0.<br/>
<strong>What is the run?</strong> The run is 3.<br/>
<strong>What is the slope?</strong> \( m = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{0}{3} = 0 \)</p>
<p>So, the horizontal line passing through \((0, 4)\) and \((3, 4)\) has a slope of 0. For all of the points on this line, the \( y \)-values will always equal 4. So, the equation is \( y = 4 \).</p>
<p>Also notice that it is parallel to the \(x\)-axis and perpendicular to the \(y\)-axis.</p>
<p>Now consider the vertical line passing through \((3, 2)\) and \((3, 0)\).</p>
<p><img alt="A graph with a vertical line passing through x=3, intersecting points (3,0) and (3,2). The line extends from y = -5 to y = 5. The x- and y-axes range from -5 to 5." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/69272e3b11c1d2c6fdc20ad28d4461233df12159"/></p>
<p><strong>What is the rise?</strong> The rise is 2.<br/>
<strong>What is the run?</strong> The run is 0.<br/>
<strong>What is the slope?</strong> \( m = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{2}{0} \) (undefined)</p>
<p>So, the vertical line passing through \((3, 2)\) and \((3, 0)\) has an undefined slope. And, for all of the points on this line, the \( x \)-values will always equal 3. So, the equation is \( x = 3 \).</p>
<p>Also notice that it is parallel to the \(y\)-axis and perpendicular to the \(x\)-axis.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Find the equation of the line parallel to the \(x\)-axis and passing through \((8, 1)\).</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Identify the point.<br/>
\((8, 1)\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Identify the slope of the line.<br/>
Since the line is parallel to the \(x\)-axis, the line is horizontal. This means the slope of the line is 0.<br/>
\( m = 0 \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Substitute the values into an equation.<br/>
From here, you may know the equation, but if you don’t, then we can use the point-slope equation.<br/>
\( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \)<br/>
\( y - 1 = 0(x - 8) \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Simplify.<br/>
\( y - 1 = 0 \)<br/>
\( y = 1 \)</p>
<p>Thus, the equation of the line parallel to the \(x\)-axis and passing through \((8, 1)\) is \( y = 1 \).</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Find the equation of the line perpendicular to the \(x\)-axis and passing through \((8, 1)\).</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Identify the point.<br/>
\((8, 1)\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Identify the slope of the line.<br/>
Since the line is perpendicular to the \(x\)-axis, the line is vertical. This means the slope of the line is undefined!<br/>
\( m = \text{undefined} \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Substitute the values into an equation.<br/>
Since the slope is undefined, we cannot use the point-slope equation. But, we know that if \((8, 1)\) is on the line, then another point vertically above this point is \((8, 2)\). Another point vertically below this point is \((8, 0)\). On a vertical line, the x-values do not change.<br/>
So, \( x = x_1 \)<br/>
\( x = 8 \)</p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>
<p>Find an equation of a line perpendicular to \( x=5 \) that contains the point \( (3,-2) \). Write the equation in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p>Again, since we know one point, the point-slope option seems more promising than the slope-intercept option. We need the slope to use this form, and we know the new line will be perpendicular to \( x=5 \). This line is vertical, so its perpendicular will be horizontal. This tells us the \( m_{\perp}=0 \).<br/>
</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Identify the point.<br/>
  \( (3,-2) \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Identify the slope of the perpendicular line.<br/>
  \( m_{\perp}=0 \) </p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Substitute the values into an equation.<br/>
  \( \begin{array}{rcl}y-y_1&amp;=&amp;m(x-x_1) \\  y-(-2)&amp;=&amp;0(x-3)\end{array} \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Simplify<br/>
  \( \begin{array}{rcl}y+2&amp;=&amp;0 \\ y&amp;=&amp;-2\end{array} \)</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Example 4</strong></p>
<p>Find an equation of a line that is perpendicular to \( y=4 \) that contains the point \( (2,3) \). Write the equation in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p>The line \( y=4 \) is a horizontal line. Any line perpendicular to it must be vertical, in the form \( x=a \). Since the perpendicular line is vertical and passes through \( (2,3) \), every point on it has an \(x\)-coordinate of 2. The equation of the perpendicular line is \( x=2 \).</p>

  undefined</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Identify the point.<br/>

  \( (x_1, y_1) \)<br/>
  \( (-3, 5) \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Write the equation.<br/>

  \( x = -3 \)</p>
