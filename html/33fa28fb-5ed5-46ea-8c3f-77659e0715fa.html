<h4>Activity (18 minutes)</h4>
<p>Students have worked on finding lines that are parallel and perpendicular to other lines that have slopes that are defined and non-zero. In this activity, students will work to find lines that are parallel and perpendicular to the \( x \)- and \( y \)-axes. To do this, students must have an understanding of the coordinate system. They must understand that the \(y\)-axis is vertical and the \(x\)-axis is horizontal. They must also understand that a coordinate is written in the form \( (x, y) \).</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Put students in pairs to work on this activity. Give each student a coordinate grid. A straight-edge and colored pencils would also help students visualize the different types of lines and their relationships.</p>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>The purpose of the discussion is to elicit conversation about slopes of horizontal lines, vertical lines, parallel lines, and perpendicular lines. Here are some questions for discussion:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;How did you find the slope of line \(l\)?&rdquo; (Vertical lines have undefined slope.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How does the slope of line \(m\) compare to line \(l\)?&rdquo; (They are the same because the lines are parallel.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How does the slope of line \(n\) compare to line \(l\)?&rdquo; (The slope of line \(n\) is zero because it is a horizontal line. The slope of line \(l\) is undefined because it is a vertical line.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How do you write the equation of a horizontal line with coordinates \((a, b)\)?&rdquo; \((y = b)\)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How do you write the equation of a vertical line with coordinates \((a, b)\)?&rdquo; \((x = a)\)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Find Equations of Lines Perpendicular to an Axis</h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Example 1:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Find an equation of a line perpendicular to \(&nbsp;x=5&nbsp;\) that contains the point \(&nbsp;(3,-2)&nbsp;\). Write the equation in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Again, since we know one point, the point-slope option seems more promising than the slope-intercept option. We need the slope to use this form, and we know the new line will be perpendicular to \(&nbsp;x=5&nbsp;\). This line is vertical, so its perpendicular will be horizontal. This tells us the \(&nbsp;m_1=0&nbsp;\).<br></p>
