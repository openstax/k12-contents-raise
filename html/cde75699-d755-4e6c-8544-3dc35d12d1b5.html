<h4>Matching Graphs and Equations</h4>
<p>When matching graphs of quadratic functions and their equations, look for the matching vertex. Then look if the parabola is opening up or down. Finally, use another point to determine if the graph has been compressed or stretched. Recall this type of transformation will affect the \(a\)-value of the equation.</p>
<p>Looking at the graph below, choose the equation that matches the graph.</p>

  <li> \(y=(x-2)^2-3\) </li>
  <li> \(y=(x+2)^2-3\) </li>
  <li> \(y=-(x+2)^2-3\) </li>
  <li> \(y=-(x-2)^2-3\) </li>
</ol>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Find the vertex.<br>
  The vertex is at \((-2, -3)\).</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Does the parabola open up or down?<br>
  The parabola opens up. So the leading coefficient is positive.</p>
<p>The correct answer is b. \(y=(x+2)^2-3\).</p>
<p>Remember the vertex form is \(y = a(x - h)^2 + k\). If the \(x\)-variable is being added in the parenthesis, the parabola has been shifted left.<br>
  The \((x + 2)\) moves the parabola left 2.<br>
  The -3 shifts it down 3 from the origin.</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Use the vertex form of the equation and write the parts you know: the coordinates of the vertex.<br>
  \(y=a(x+2)^2-3\)</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  To solve for \(a\), find another point on the graph of the parabola and plug in those values for \(x\) and \(y\) in the equation you wrote.<br>
  Substitute the point \((-1, -2)\) into the equation to check the value of \(a\). We have hypothesized \(a = 1\), and with the coordinates from the second point, \(x = -1\) and \(y = -2\).</p>
<p>Step 5<br>
  Solve for \(a\).<br>
  \(-2 = a(-1 + 2)^2 - 3\). Now solve for \(a\) to find that \(a = 1\).</p>
<p>Step 6<br>
  Plug the value for \(a\) back into the equation.<br>
  So, \(y=(x+2)^2-3\).</p>

  <p>Here is how to match a graph and its equation:</p>
  <p>Step 1<br>
    Find the vertex.<br>
    \((1, 2)\)</p>
  <p>Step 2<br>
    Does the parabola open up or down?<br>
    Up &mdash; this means the leading coefficient is positive.</p>
  <p>Step 3<br>
    Use the vertex form of the equation and write the parts you know: the coordinates of the vertex.<br>
    \(y=a(x-1)^2+2\)</p>
  <p>Step 4<br>
    To solve for \(a\), find another point on the graph of the parabola and plug in those values for \(x\) and \(y\) in the equation you wrote.<br>
    \((0, 3)\) is also on the graph of this parabola. So, \(3=a(0-1)^2+2\).</p>
  <p>Step 5<br>
    Solve for \(a\).<br>
    \(3=a(0-1)^2+2\)</p>
  <p>\(3=a(-1)^2+2\)</p>
  <p>\(3=a+2\)<br>
    \(1=a\)</p>
  <p>Step 6<br>
    Plug the value for \(a\) back into the equation.<br>
    \(y=1(x-1)^2+2\)<br>
    \(y=(x-1)^2+2\)<br>
    The answer is d.</p>
