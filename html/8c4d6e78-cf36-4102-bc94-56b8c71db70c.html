  <p dir="ltr">In this lesson, you will write and solve inequalities to answer questions about a situation. You will also practice finding the solution set to an inequality by reasoning about its composition and parts. <br></p>
  <p dir="ltr">When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
</span>
<ul>
  <li>Analyze the structure of an inequality in one variable to help determine if the solution is greater or less than the solution to the related equation.</li>
  <li>Write and solve inequalities to answer questions about a situation.</li>
</ul> 
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:<br></p>
