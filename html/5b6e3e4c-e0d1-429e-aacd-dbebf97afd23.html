<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>In a previous lesson, you saw an equation that defines the height of a potato as a function of time after it was launched from a mechanical device. Here is a different function modeling the height of a potato, in feet, \(t\) seconds after being fired from a different device:</p>
<p>\(f(t) = -16t^2 + 80t + 64\)</p>

    <p>Since the potato hits the ground at a height of 0 feet, set the equation equal to 0. </p>

      <p>Think about your current sense of curiosity. Are the following statements are true for you?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I got so absorbed in learning that I lost track of time.  
        </li>
        <li>
          I took the initiative to learn more about one of my interests. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Donâ€™t worry if none of these statements are true for you. Developing this trait takes time. Your first step starts today!</p>
