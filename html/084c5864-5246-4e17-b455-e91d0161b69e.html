<p>The missing value in the second row is 600. The missing values in the last row are 10 and 400.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>If the values for length and area are plotted, what would the graph look like?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> The points would form a stretched out upside-down U shape, or an arch.
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>How is the relationship between the length and the area of the rectangle different from other kinds of
    relationships we&rsquo;ve seen before?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> As one quantity increases, the other quantity first increases and then decreases, instead
    of always increasing or always decreasing.
  </li>

<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool down, so there is no need to
  slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool down to provide guidance
  for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current
  understanding.</p>
