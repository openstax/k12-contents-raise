<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>The approximate solutions are given so students can check (using a calculator) if their exact solutions match.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>For the equation \(x^2+14x= -46\), the approximate solutions are \(x \approx -8.732\) and \(x \approx -5.268\).</p>
<p>Find the exact solutions by completing the square. Show your reasoning.</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>\(\begin{aligned} x^{2}+14 x &amp;=-46 \\ x^{2}+14 x+49 &amp;=-46+49 \\ x^{2}+14 x+49 &amp;=3 \\ (x+7)^{2} &amp;=3 \\ \sqrt{(x+7)^{2}} &amp;=\sqrt{3} \\ x+7 &amp;=\pm \sqrt{3} \\ x &amp;=-7 \pm \sqrt{3} \end{aligned}\) </p>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
