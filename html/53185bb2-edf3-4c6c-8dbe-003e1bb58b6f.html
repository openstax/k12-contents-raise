<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>The mathematical purpose of this activity is for students to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Distinguish between linear and nonlinear relationships in bivariate, numerical data.</li>
  <li>Informally assess the fit of a linear model.</li>
  <li>Compare the slope and the vertical intercepts of different linear models.</li>
  <li>Describe the relationship between two variables.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students are <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/1a32fc7619feae137f83a8a58369c908593bb1d8" target="_blank">given cards</a> showing scatter plots and a linear model. They sort the cards based on how well the lines fit the data as well as by slope and intercept in increasing order.</p>
<p>A sorting task gives students opportunities to analyze representations, statements, and structures closely and make connections.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Give students a chance to familiarize themselves with what is on the cards. For example, you might ask them to sort the cards into categories of their choosing and explain their categories to their partner.</p>

  <p><em>Conversing:  Discussion Supports.</em> In pairs, ask students to take turns sorting the cards and explaining their reasoning to their partner. Display the following sentence frames for all to see: &ldquo; _____ should be before _____ because . . . ,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I noticed _____ , so I . . . .&rdquo; Encourage students to challenge each other when they disagree. This will help students clarify their reasoning about linear models.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>

<p>Your teacher will give you a set of cards that show scatter plots.</p>
<p>Arrange all the cards in three different ways. Ensure that you and your partner agree on each arrangement before moving on to the next one. Sort all the cards in order from:</p>
<ul>
  <li> best to worst for representing with a linear model </li>
  <li> least to greatest slope of a linear model that fits the data well </li>
  <li> least to greatest vertical intercept of a linear model that fits the data well </li>
</ul>
<br />
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" >
  <li> What is the order of the cards that displays the best to worst representations of a linear model? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> B, E, A, and F, C, D, and G. There may be some debate about the exact order. It is important that students recognize that B is the best fit, and that D and G should not be fit with linear models. They should be able to reason that linear models fit more poorly the farther the data are from the line.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent"  start="2">
  <li> What is the order of the cards that displays the least to greatest slope representations of a linear model that fits the data well? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> E, B, A, and F, C. D and G do not have linear models that fit the data well. </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent"  start="3">
  <li> What is the order of the cards that displays the least to greatest vertical intercept of a linear model that fits the data well? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A, C, F, B, E. D and G do not have linear models that fit the data well. </p>
<p>Know that the line of best fit is the line that provides the best fit to the data. It should follow the trend of the data and go through the middle of the data with a similar number of points on each side of the line.</p>
<br />
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>For each card, write a sentence that describes how \(y\) changes as \(x\) increases and whether the linear model is a good fit for the data.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
<p> Compare your answer: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Card A: As \(x\) increases, \(y\) also increases. The linear model fits the data fairly well.&nbsp; </li>
  <li> Card B: As \(x\) increases, \(y\) decreases. The linear model fits the data very well.&nbsp; </li>
  <li> Card C: As \(x\) increases, \(y\) increases. The linear model fits most of the data very well; however, there are two values that do not follow this trend.&nbsp; </li>
  <li> Card D: As \(x\) increases, \(y\) goes up and down like a wave. The data do not follow the line very well at all.&nbsp; </li>
  <li> Card E: As \(x\) increases, \(y\) decreases. Most of the data fit a linear model very well, but the one point at (7,15) does not fit with the rest of the data very well.&nbsp; </li>
  <li> Card F: As \(x\) increases, \(y\) increases. The linear model fits the data fairly well.&nbsp; </li>
  <li> Card G: As \(x\) increases, \(y\) decreases and then increases. The data do not follow the line very well at all. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>The purpose of this discussion is for students to discuss the goodness of fit for linear models.</p>
<p>Here are some questions for discussion.</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;How are scatter plots of A and F the same? How are they different?&rdquo; (They have the same slope, and the linear models for each scatter plot are equally well fit. They are different because they have a different vertical intercept.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How do you know if a linear model is a good fit?&rdquo; (You need to look at the scatter plot and the line of best fit and make a decision about whether or not the data follow a linear trend.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Why is the goodness fit for the linear model in scatter plot B better than the fit for the linear model in scatter plot A?&rdquo; (The data in B fall on or very close to the linear model. The data in A are scattered around the line of best fit and have roughly the same number of values below that line of best fit as above the line of best fit.)</li>
</ul>

          Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: Where the line starts does not determine the line of best fit. The answer is line 2 is the best fit because it goes through the middle of the data with about the same number of data points above and below the line.

          Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: Where the line ends does not determine its fit. The answer is line 2 is the best fit because it goes through the middle of the data with about the same number of data points above and below the line.

          That&rsquo;s correct! Check yourself: Line 2 goes down the middle of the data and has almost the same number of points above and below the line.

          Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: The steepness of the slope does not determine the line of best fit. The answer is line 2 is the best fit because it goes through the middle of the data with about the same number of data points above and below the line.

<h4>Draw a Best-Fit Line for the Plotted Data</h4>
<p>When looking to draw a line of best fit, first make sure a linear model works for the data. <br>
</p>
<p>Next, place the line between the data points so that about the same number of points are above and below the line. <br>
</p>
<p>Below are two examples of lines of best fit drawn through scatter plots. <br>
</p>

<h4>Try It: Draw a Best-Fit Line for the Plotted Data</h4>
<p>The scatter plots below are the same scatter plot, but each student drew their best fit line differently. Which line do you believe to be the best fit, and why? <br>
</p>

<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to choose the best fitting line for the scatter plot:</p>
<p>Patti&rsquo;s line looks like it fits the data well, so it would probably produce good predictions. The line goes through the middle of the points in the scatter plot, and the points are fairly close to the line. </p>
