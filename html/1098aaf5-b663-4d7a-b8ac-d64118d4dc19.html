<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm up encourages students to notice a new pattern of change (quadratic) by contrasting it with two familiar
  patterns (linear and exponential). In the table showing a quadratic relationship, students are not expected to
  recognize how the input and output values are related. This prompt gives students opportunities to see and make use of
  structure. The specific structure they might notice is that the output values don&rsquo;t change by equal amounts or
  equal factors over equal intervals and that the output values increase and then decrease.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Look at the patterns in the three tables. What do you notice? What do you wonder?</p>

<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Answer:</p>
<p>Things you may notice:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The \(x\)-values are \(1\), \(2\), \(3\), \(4\), and \(5\) in all three tables. </li>
  <li> In the first two tables, the \(y\)-values increase, while in the third table, they increase and then decrease.
  </li>
  <li> The \(y\)-values in the first table are all multiples of \(5\), and they grow linearly. In the second table, the
    \(y\)-values grow by a factor of \(2\) each time \(x\) increases by \(1\). In the third table, there isn&rsquo;t an
    obvious pattern in how the \(y\)-values change. </li>
</ul>
<p>Things you may wonder:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Is there a rule for the relationship in the third table? </li>
  <li> Will the \(y\)-values in the third table continue to decrease, or will they increase again at some point? </li>
  <li> What would the third relationship look like if graphed? </li>
</ul>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share what they noticed and wondered. Record and display their responses for all to see. After all
  responses have been recorded without commentary or editing, ask students, &ldquo;Is there anything on these lists that
  you are wondering about?&rdquo; Encourage students to respectfully disagree, ask for clarification, point out
  contradicting information, etc.</p>
<p>If no one wonders about the rule for the relationship in the third table or how the outputs are changing, ask
  students to consider these questions. Tell students that in this unit they will investigate relationships such the one
  shown in the third table.</p>
