<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 1</p>
<p>Write the explicit formula for the sequence given by the terms 18, 21, 24, 27, ...</p>
<p><strong>Solution:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1-</strong> Write the general formula.<br>
  \(a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Substitute values for the first term, common difference/ratio, term number.&nbsp;<br>
  \(a_1 = 18\), \(d = 3\)<br>
  \(a_n = 18 + (n - 1)^3</p>
<br />
<p>So, the explicit formula for the sequence 18, 21, 24, 27â€¦ is \(a_n = 18 + (n - 1)^3\).</p>
<p>Now any term can more easily be determined - even the 1000th term!</p>
<br>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 2</p>
<p> Find the 15th term of a sequence where the first term is 3 and the common difference is 6. </p>
<p><strong>Step 1 - </strong>Write the general formula.<br>
  \(a_n=a_1+(n&minus;1)d\) </p>
<p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Substitute values for the first term, common difference/ratio, term number. <br>
  \(a_1 = 3, d = 6\), \(n = 15\)<br>
  \(a_{15} = 3 + (15 - 1)6\) </p>
<p><strong>Step 3 -</strong> Simplify the expression. <br>
  \(a_{15} = 3 + (14)6\) <br>
  \(a_{15} = 3 + 84\)<br>
  \(a_15 = 87\) </p>
<p>If the explicit formula for this question was needed, we would not have substituted \(n = 15\) and the \(n\)th term formula would have been \(a_n = 3 + (n - 1)6\). This formula is also equivalent to </p>
<p>\(a_n = 3 + 6(n - 1)\). </p>
