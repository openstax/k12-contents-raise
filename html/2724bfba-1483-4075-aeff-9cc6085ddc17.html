<p>In this culminating project, you will integrate ideas from the unit as you collect, summarize, interpret, and draw conclusions from bivariate data using scatter plots, best fit lines, and correlation coefficients. 
</p>

<p>Technology isnâ€™t required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for you to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems. 
</p>

<p>When you finish this project, you will have demonstrated how to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Collect data, create a linear model to fit the data, determine if the linear model is a good fit, and use the information from my linear model to answer questions.
  </li>
</ul>
