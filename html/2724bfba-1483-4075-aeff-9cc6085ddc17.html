<h3>Activity P3.2: Analyze Data</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Before researching data, do you think the number of penalties a team gets in a season is correlated to the number of wins the team gets in that season? Do you think it is a positive or negative relationship? Do you think the relationship is weak or strong? Be prepared to show your reasoning. </li>
  <li> Is there a relationship between the number of penalties a team gets in a season and the number of wins in that season? Show any mathematical work that leads to your answer. </li>
  <li> Do penalties cause a change in wins or wins cause a change in penalties or neither? Be prepared to show your reasoning. </li>
</ol>
