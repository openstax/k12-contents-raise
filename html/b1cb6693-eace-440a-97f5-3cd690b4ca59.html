<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>Earlier in the course, students looked at constant rates of change in linear functions. In this activity, they begin
  to explore average rates of change in an exponential growth function. In particular, the focus for this activity is on
  how exponential functions have different rates of change for different input intervals, which was not the case for
  linear functions.</p>
<p>In the next activity, they investigate average rates of growth in a decay function. In both cases, they revisit
  contexts from earlier lessons.</p>
<h4> Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here is a table and a graph that show the number of coffee shops worldwide that a company had in its first 10 years,
  between 1987 and 1997. The growth in the number of shops was roughly exponential.</p>

  <li> Make some observations about the rates of change you calculated. What do these average rates tell us about how
    the company was growing during this time period? </li>
  <br>
  <strong>Answer: </strong> For example: The average rate of change of the first 6 years is almost double that of the
  first 3 years. The average rate of change of the 10-year period is almost 7 times greater than that of the first 3
  years and more than 3 times greater than the first 6 years. The company was growing at an increasing rate over the
  10-year time period.<br>

  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
    <li> An average rate of change of \(22\frac{1}{3}\) is a fairly accurate prediction of growth over the first 3
      years, but it is a poor prediction of growth much beyond 1992. </li>
    <li>An average rate of change of 42.5 is an okay prediction of growth over the first 6 years, but it overestimates
      early on and greatly underestimates the growth in years after 1994. </li>
    <li> An average rate of change of 139.5 does not accurately predict the actual growth of the company between 1987

    the number of stores.</li>
  <br>
  <strong>Answer: </strong> For example: The average rate of growth from 1997 to 2007 is 1,359.9 stores per year. This
  is 60 times greater than the average rate of change over the first 3 years and almost 10 times greater than the
  average rate of change over the first 10 years of the time period. The number of stores continued to grow at an
  increasing rate from 1997 to 2007.

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>If students struggle with a rate of change that is not constant like the slope they saw in linear relationships, ask
  if they can draw a straight line connecting all the points on the graph in question 3. Spend time on the graph in the
  synthesis so the lines can help them see why the rate of change varies with an exponential function.</p>
<h4> Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>For the third question, make sure students see that when they calculated the average rate of change for each of the
  three time periods, they were in effect finding the slope of the line that goes through two points that represent the
  starting year and the ending year. Display a graph like the one shown here to help illustrate this point:</p>
<p><img
    alt="11 points on coordinate plane. Lines connect first point to fourth, seventh, and eleventh points. Horizontal axis from 0 to 10, time in years. Vertical axis from 0 to 1500, number of coffee shops."
    src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/69e0f30cf89cfc35f420c63da1e7be40107ad268"></p>
<p>The line that connects the points for 1987 and 1990 fits the data for that period fairly well, so the slope of that
  line (the average rate of change between those two points) describes the growth in those three years fairly
  accurately. In contrast, the line that connects the points for 1987 and 1997 does not at all fit the data, so the
  slope of that line does not paint an accurate picture of how the company was growing that decade.</p>
<p>Here are some questions for discussion:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>&ldquo;Would the average rate of change between 1994 and 1997 accurately depict how the company was growing in the
    last three years in the data?&rdquo; (Yes, because the average rate of change from 1994 to 1997 is 329 shops per
    year since \(\frac{1412&minus;425}{10&minus;7}=329\). The actual number of shops increased by 252, 338, and then 397
    from 1994 to 1997, respectively.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;Is there a single period of time where the average rate of change would accurately summarize how the
    company was growing from 1987 to 1997?&rdquo; (No, since the number of shops is increasing at an increasing rate, an
    average of two values is not enough to summarize the growth of the company.) </li>
</ol>

<h5> Support for English Language Learners</h5>
  <p>Use this routine to amplify mathematical uses of language to communicate how the rate of change differs during each
    specified time period. Encourage students to demonstrate mathematical thinking and problem solving by referencing
    two points on the graph in their explanation. Press for further detail by asking, &ldquo;How can you use the graph
    to determine which time period is represented best by the rate of change?&rdquo; This will help students understand
    how the rate of change differs in exponential functions through a whole-class discussion.</p>

<h4> Average Rate of Change from a Table</h4>

  \(A\), in square yards, of algae covering a pond \(t\) weeks after beginning treatment to control the algae bloom.
  Here is a table showing approximately how many square yards of algae remain during the first 5 weeks of treatment.</p>

<p>The average rate of change of \(A\) from the start of treatment to week 2 is about &ndash;107 square yards per week
  since \(\frac{A(2)-A(0)}{2-0} \approx -107\). The average rate of change of \(A\) from week 2 to week 4, however, is
  only about &ndash;12 square yards per week since \(\frac{A(4)-A(2)}{4-2} \approx -12\) .</p>
