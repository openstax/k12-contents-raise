<p>In this lesson, you will build on your knowledge of using simple quadratic functions to describe how an object falls over time, given the effect of constantly changing speed. You will construct quadratic functions to represent projectile motions, objects that are launched directly upward. Working through the activities, you will discover that gravity affects the speed of a projectile, and the linear model will need to be represented differently to adjust for the change.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li> Create quadratic functions and graphs that represent a situation. </li>
  <li> Relate the vertex of a graph and the zeros of a function to a situation. </li>
  <li> Know that the domain of a function can depend on the situation it represents. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
