<h4>Finding Intercepts of a Line</h4>
<p>Every linear equation can be represented by a unique line that shows all the solutions of the equation. We have seen that when graphing a line by plotting points, you can use any three solutions to graph. This means that two people graphing the line might use different sets of three points.</p>
<p>At first glance, their two lines might not appear to be the same, since they would have different points labeled. But if all the work was done correctly, the lines should be exactly the same. One way to recognize that they are indeed the same line is to look at where the line crosses the \(x\)-axis and the \(y\)-axis. These points are called the intercepts of a line.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the graphs of the lines.</p>
<p><img alt="The figure shows four graphs of different equations. In example a the graph of 2 x plus y plus 6 is graphed on the x y-coordinate plane. The x and y axes run from negative 8 to 8. The points (0, 6) and (3, 0) are plotted and labeled. A straight line goes through both points and has arrows on both ends. In example b the graph of 3 x minus 4 y plus 12 is graphed on the x y-coordinate plane. The x and y axes run from negative 8 to 8. The points (0, negative 3) and (4, 0) are plotted and labeled. A straight line goes through both points and has arrows on both ends. In example c the graph of x minus y plus 5 is graphed on the x y-coordinate plane. The x and y axes run from negative 8 to 8. The points (0, negative 5) and (5, 0) are plotted and labeled. A straight line goes through both points and has arrows on both ends. In example d the graph of y plus negative 2 x is graphed on the x y-coordinate plane. The x and y axes run from negative 8 to 8. The point (0, 0) is plotted and labeled. A straight line goes through this point and the points (negative 1, 2) and (1, negative 2) and has arrows on both ends." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="612" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/fe7c894af22fc816272cc2a3a72e056a1da78b83" width="550"><br></p>

<p>For each line, the y-coordinate of the point where the line crosses the \(x\)-axis is zero. The point where the line crosses the \(x\)-axis has the form (a, 0) and is called the \(x\)-intercepts of the line. The \(x\)-intercepts occurs when y is zero.</p>
<p>In each line, the x-coordinate of the point where the line crosses the \(y\)-axis is zero. The point where the line crosses the \(y\)-axis has the form \((0, b)\) and is called the \(y\)-intercepts of the line. The \(y\)-intercepts occurs when x is zero.</p>
<p>Recognizing that the \(x\)-intercepts occurs when y is zero and that the \(y\)-intercepts occurs when x is zero, gives us a method to find the intercepts of a line from its equation. To find the \(x\)-intercepts, let \(y=0\) and solve for x. To find the \(y\)-intercepts, let \(x=0\) and solve for y.</p>
<p>We can use this method to find the intercepts of the equation \(2x + y = 8\)</p>
<p>To find the \(x\)-intercept, let \(y\)=0.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Let \(y = 0\).<br>
  \(2x + 0 = 8\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Simplify.<br>
  \(2x = 8\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Simplify.<br>
  \(x = 4\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - The \(x\)-intercepts is:<br>
  \((4, 0)\)</p>
<br>
<p>To find the \(y\)-intercepts, let \(x = 0\).</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Let \(y = 0\).<br>
  \(2(0) + y = 8\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Simplify.<br>
  \(0 + y = 8\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Simplify.<br>
  \(y = 8\)<br>
  The \(x\)-intercept is: \((0, 8)\)</p>
<p>The intercepts are the points (4,0) and (0,8).</p>

      <p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: You seem to have found the intercepts but incorrectly identified which intercept is the \(x\)-intercepts and which is the \(y\)-intercepts. The \(x\)-intercepts occurs when y is zero, so the coordinates should be \((x, 0)\) The \(y\)-intercepts occurs when x is zero, so the coordinates should be \((0, y)\).</p>

      <p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: Remember the \(x\)-intercepts is written \((x, 0)\) and the \(y\)-intercepts is written \((0, y)\). To find the \(x\)-intercepts, let \(y=0\) and solve for \(x: -5(0)=10x-20\), \(20=10x\), \(x=2\). To find the \(y\)-intercepts, let \(x=0\) and solve for \(y: -5y=10(0)-20\); \(y=4\).</p>

    <div class="os-raise-ib-pset-attempts-exhausted-response" data-answer="\(x\)-intercepts \((4, 0)\); \(y\)-intercepts \((0, 2)\)">
      <p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: You may have confused the intercepts. The \(x\)-intercepts is the x-value when y is zero and the \(y\)-intercepts is the y-value when x is xero. To find the \(x\)-intercepts, let \(y=0\) and solve for \(x: -5(0)=10x-20\), \(20=10x, x=2\). To find the \(y\)-intercepts, let \(x=0\) and solve for \(y: -5y=10(0)-20\); \(y=4\).</p>

    <p>That&rsquo;s correct! Check yourself: To find the \(x\)-intercepts, let y=0 and solve for \(x: -5(0) = 10x -20\); \(x=2\). To find the \(y\)-intercepts, let \(x=0\) and solve for \(y: -5y = 10(0)-20\); \(y=4\).&nbsp;<br></p>
