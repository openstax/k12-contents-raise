<h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>
<p>In middle school, students learned that a solution to an equation is a value or values that make the equation true.
  In this lesson, they revisit what they learned about solutions to equations in one variable and two variables. They
  also continue to practice modeling relationships with equations and to make sense of equations and their solutions in
  context.</p>
<p>Students verify and find solutions to given equations by checking if the values satisfy the equations and by
  reasoning. Some students may choose to solve equations algebraically or by performing certain sequences of steps they
  learned in middle school, but students are not expected to rely on algebraic methods to answer questions here. A
  little later in the unit, students will take a close look at the moves for rewriting and solving equations.</p>
<p>In the next lesson, students will revisit the idea that coordinate pairs that are on a graph of an equation in two
  variables are solutions to the equation.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explain (orally and in writing) the meaning of solutions to equations in one variable and two variables.</li>
  <li>Find solutions to equations in one variable and in two variables by reasoning about the relationships in context.
  </li>
  <li>Interpret solutions to equations in one variable and in two variables.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Explain what it means for a value or pair of values to be a solution to an equation.</li>
  <li>Find solutions to equations by reasoning about a situation or by using algebra.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Required Materials</h4>
<p>None</p>
<h4>Required Preparation</h4>
<p>None</p>
<p>Acquire devices that can run Desmos (recommended) or other graphing technology. It is ideal if each student has their
  own device.</p>
<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>
<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson. Encourage students to look for
    these words and notice their use and meanings.</li>
  <li>Encourage students to use key vocabulary words in &ldquo;math talk&rdquo; and their written and oral explanations.
  </li>
  <li>Utilize a word wall. Sample cards are located here: <a

<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are
  only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.
  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>ELPS 1(C) use strategic learning techniques such as concept mapping, drawing, memorizing, comparing, contrasting, and
    reviewing to acquire basic and grade-level vocabulary
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and
    reinforce concept and language attainment
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(G) express opinions, ideas, and feelings ranging from communicating single words and short phrases to
    participating in extended discussions on a variety of social and grade-appropriate academic topics
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Support for Building Character</h4>
