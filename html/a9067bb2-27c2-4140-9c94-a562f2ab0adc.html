<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity prompts students to graph equations to solve problems and think about appropriate values of their variables. The context is the thickness and the area of a sheet of paper that is repeatedly folded.</p>
<p>For both equations, only whole numbers make sense as inputs. Students consider why this makes sense in this context. (This is in contrast, for example, to the price of producing solar energy in the earlier activity. While the data given are on an annual basis, it makes sense to &ldquo;connect the dots&rdquo; because there is a price for producing solar energy at any given time.) Without instruction about how to create a discrete graph with their graphing technology, students are likely to produce a continuous graph. This is a good opportunity to discuss how to interpret a model for a particular context.</p>
<p>Look for the different methods students use to find out how many folds are needed to reach a certain thickness. Identify students who used a table, a graph, or an equation so they can share later.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>To increase student interest, ask students to do some research: What is the current world record for the number of times humans were able to fold a sheet of paper? (As of this writing, the world record is 12 folds, with the help of a hydraulic press.)</p>
<p>Give each student a sheet of paper. Ask them to fold it in half, and in half again, as many times as they can. (To save paper, you might have students do this in pairs.) Once they have folded it as many times as they can, ask a few students to share how many times they folded it, and estimate the thickness of the folded paper. Tell students that they are going to investigate the relationship between the number of folds and the thickness of the paper.</p>
<p>Provide access to graphing technology. This activity requires students to be mindful about the scale or graphing window. The activities that specifically target that skill are optional, so this gives students a chance to practice scaling the axes. Students may need more instruction or a review on how to graph exponentials with their graphing technology and also on how to adjust the window appropriately.</p>
<h5> Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<div>
  <p>Present the question: &ldquo;How many folds does it take before the folded sheet of paper is more than 1 mm thick?&rdquo; Consider using this ambiguous response: &ldquo;It takes 4.5 folds, because I looked on the graph to check the points.&rdquo; Ask students to identify the error, critique the reasoning, and write an improved explanation. As students discuss with a partner, listen for students who identify and clarify the ambiguous language in the statement. Invite students to share their critiques and corrected explanations with the class. Listen for and amplify the language students use to describe the point using both the graph and a created table. This helps students evaluate, and improve on, the written mathematical arguments of others as they clarify their understanding of discrete graphs.</p>

    <li> How many folds does it take before the folded sheet of paper is more than 1 mm thick? How many folds before it is more than 1 cm thick? Explain how you know. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Answer:</strong> It takes 5 folds before the paper is more than 1 mm thick. After 4 folds, the paper is 0.8 mm thick, and after 5 folds, it is 1.6 mm thick. It takes 8 folds before the paper is more than 1 cm or 10 mm thick (1.28 cm to be precise). <br>

    <li> In this context, can \(n\) take negative values? Explain your reasoning. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Answer: </strong>The variable<em>&nbsp;</em>\(n\) cannot&nbsp;take negative values (unless the original sheet of paper can be unfolded). <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li> Can \(a\) take negative values? Explain your reasoning. <br>

<h4> Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>If students have trouble organizing their data points, suggest that they use a table.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Focus the discussion on:</p>
<ul>
  <li> How students identified the growth factor, given an equation or a description. </li>
  <li> How students determined how many folds are needed to reach a certain thickness. Invite previously identified students to share their strategies. </li>
  <li> The meaningful values of the variables in the equations: </li>
  <ul>
    <li> Highlight that a discrete graph is more appropriate in both situations: only the whole-number values make sense for the number of folds because it is not possible to fold the paper a fractional number of times. </li>
    <li> Practically speaking, a large number of folds, such as 36, is not possible. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>Demonstrate, using graphing technology, how to graph the equations and invite students to share how they chose an appropriate graphing window. If students just typed an equation, most likely the tool plotted a continuous curve. This is an opportunity to talk about interpreting the continuous graph in this context: really, only whole-number values for \(n\) are meaningful. Time permitting, you might demonstrate how to graph only whole number values of \(n\) using your graphing technology of choice. Typically, this is done by using the technology to generate a table based on a rule. Here is an example:</p>
<p><img alt="7 points on coordinate plane, showing exponential growth. Horizontal axis from 0 to 8, labeled number of folds. Vertical axis from 0 to 4, labeled thickness in millimeters." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/65f04772671c4508dc449207b4b3285a7464a055" height="500"></p>
<p>Time permitting, consider asking students if the equations \(t=(0.05) \cdot 2^n\) and \(a=(93.5) \cdot (\frac{1}{2})^n\) could be plotted on the same set of axes. Even though the variable \(n\)&nbsp;(the number of folds) is the same for the two equations, the thickness \(t\) and the area \(a\) are measured in different units, so they cannot be plotted on the same axes.</p>

<h4>Domain and Range of Exponential Graphs</h4>
<p>The graph below describes the amount of caffeine, \(c\), in a person&rsquo;s body \(t\) hours after an initial measurement of 100 mg.</p>
<p><img alt="Graph of function." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c6505a870a48b5a86ecc8bf01f3b25c1613990ba"></p>
<p>What is the smallest value \(c\) can reach?</p>
<p>Since \(c\) is the amount of caffeine, it can get close to 0.</p>
<p>Can \(t\)&nbsp;ever take on negative values?</p>
<p>No, time will not be negative in this relationship because time is moving forward.</p>
<p>What are the lowest and highest values for \(t\)?</p>
<p>At the beginning, \(t=0\), and \(t\)&nbsp;can go as long as it takes for \(c\)&nbsp;to get so close to 0 it is insignificant.</p>
<p>The domain (or values of \(t\)) written as an inequality is \(t \geq 0\).</p>
<p>The range (or values of \(c\)) written as an inequality is \(0&lt;c \leq 100\).</p>
<h4> Try It: Domain and Range of Exponential Graphs</h4>
<p>The dollar value of a car is a function, \(f\), of the number of years, \(t\), since the car was purchased. The car was purchased at $12,000. Tell the domain and range.</p>

<p>Write down your answers. Then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to determine the domain and range of an exponential function:</p>
<p>To determine the domain, look at the \(t\) values. The car is bought when \(t=0\), so the domain is \(t \geq 0\).</p>
<p>To determine the range, look at the \(f\)&nbsp;values, or the possible dollar values of the car. The car is bought at $12,000 and will lose value until the value is close to $0, but it will never be worth negative dollars.</p>
<p>The range is \(0&lt;f \leq 12000\).</p>
