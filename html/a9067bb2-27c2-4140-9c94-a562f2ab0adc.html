<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity prompts students to graph equations to solve problems and think about appropriate values of their
  variables. The context is the thickness and the area of a sheet of paper that is repeatedly folded.</p>
<p>For both equations, only whole numbers make sense as inputs. Students consider why this makes sense in this context.
  (This is in contrast, for example, to the price of producing solar energy in the earlier activity. While the data
  given are on an annual basis, it makes sense to &ldquo;connect the dots&rdquo; because there is a price for producing
  solar energy at any given time.) Without instruction about how to create a discrete graph with their graphing
  technology, students are likely to produce a continuous graph. This is a good opportunity to discuss how to interpret
  a model for a particular context.</p>
<p>Look for the different methods students use to find out how many folds are needed to reach a certain thickness.
  Identify students who used a table, a graph, or an equation so they can share later.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>To increase student interest, ask students to do some research: What is the current world record for the number of
  times humans were able to fold a sheet of paper? (As of this writing, the world record is 12 folds, with the help of a
  hydraulic press.)</p>
<p>Give each student a sheet of paper. Ask them to fold it in half, and in half again, as many times as they can. (To
  save paper, you might have students do this in pairs.) Once they have folded it as many times as they can, ask a few
  students to share how many times they folded it, and estimate the thickness of the folded paper. Tell students that
  they are going to investigate the relationship between the number of folds and the thickness of the paper.</p>
<p>Provide access to graphing technology. This activity requires students to be mindful about the scale or graphing
  window. The activities that specifically target that skill are extension, so this gives students a chance to practice
  scaling the axes. Students may need more instruction or a review on how to graph exponentials with their graphing
  technology and also on how to adjust the window appropriately.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> The thickness \(t\) in millimeters of a folded sheet of paper after it is folded \(n\) times is given by the
    equation \(t=(0.05) \cdot 2^n\). </li>
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
    <li> What does the number 0.05 represent in the equation? <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Answer: </strong>The sheet of paper is 0.05 mm thick. <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>What does the number 2 represent in the equation? <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Answer: </strong>The number 2 indicates that the thickness doubles with each increment of \(n\), the number of folds. <br>

    <li> How many folds does it take before the folded sheet of paper is more than 1 mm thick? How many folds before it
      is more than 1 cm thick? Explain how you know. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Answer:</strong> It takes 5 folds before the paper is more than 1 mm thick. After 4 folds, the paper is
      0.8 mm thick, and after 5 folds, it is 1.6 mm thick. It takes 8 folds before the paper is more than 1 cm or 10 mm
      thick (1.28 cm to be precise). <br>

      <br>
    </li>
    <li> In this context, can \(n\) take negative values? Be prepared to show your reasoning. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Answer: </strong>The variable<em>&nbsp;</em>\(n\) cannot&nbsp;take negative values (unless the original
      sheet of paper can be unfolded). <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li> Can \(a\) take negative values? Be prepared to show your reasoning. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Answer:</strong> No. The area of the sheet of paper can never be negative, no matter how many times it is
      folded.<br>

    <li> Identify the range of the graph using an inequality.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Answer</strong><strong>:</strong>

      \(0&lt;a \leq 93.5\). Note that the area cannot be negative, or even 0, because the paper will not disappear. <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li> What equation represents the horizontal asymptote? <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Answer:</strong> \(y=0\)

  <li>Use the equation to make a prediction of the thickness with 7 folds.<br><br><strong>Answer: </strong>\(t=(0.05) \cdot 2^7=(0.05)(128)=6.4\)</li>
  <li>The \(y\)-intercept represents the initial thickness of the paper \(t\) before folding (when \(n\) is zero). Calculate the value of the \(y\)-intercept.<br><br><strong>Answer: </strong>\(t=(0.05) \cdot 2^0=(0.05)(1)=0.05\)</li>
  <li>The asymptote represents the possible limit of thickness of the paper as it is folded.  What does this mean? <br><br><strong>Answer: </strong>In this equation, the value of thickness of the paper \(t\) becomes larger as the number of folds \(n\) increases (approaches infinity). This means that, as the paper is folded an increasing number of times, the thickness has the potential to be infinite, but in reality, it can never quite reach it.</li>
</ol>
<h4> Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>If students have trouble organizing their data points, suggest that they use a table.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Focus the discussion on:</p>
<ul>
  <li> How students identified the growth factor, given an equation or a description. </li>
  <li> How students determined how many folds are needed to reach a certain thickness. Invite previously identified
    students to share their strategies. </li>
  <li> The meaningful values of the variables in the equations: </li>
  <ul>
    <li> Highlight that a discrete graph is more appropriate in both situations: only the whole-number values make sense
      for the number of folds because it is not possible to fold the paper a fractional number of times. </li>
    <li> Practically speaking, a large number of folds, such as 36, is not possible. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>Demonstrate, using graphing technology, how to graph the equations and invite students to share how they chose an
  appropriate graphing window. If students just typed an equation, most likely the tool plotted a continuous curve. This
  is an opportunity to talk about interpreting the continuous graph in this context: really, only whole-number values
  for \(n\) are meaningful. Time permitting, you might demonstrate how to graph only whole number values of \(n\) using
  your graphing technology of choice. Typically, this is done by using the technology to generate a table based on a
  rule. Here is an example:</p>
<p><img
    alt="7 points on coordinate plane, showing exponential growth. Horizontal axis from 0 to 8, labeled number of folds. Vertical axis from 0 to 4, labeled thickness in millimeters."
    height="500" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/65f04772671c4508dc449207b4b3285a7464a055"></p>
<p>Time permitting, consider asking students if the equations \(t=(0.05) \cdot 2^n\) and \(a=(93.5) \cdot
  (\frac{1}{2})^n\) could be plotted on the same set of axes. Even though the variable \(n\)&nbsp;(the number of folds)
  is the same for the two equations, the thickness \(t\) and the area \(a\) are measured in different units, so they
  cannot be plotted on the same axes.</p>

</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Here is how to determine the domain and range of an exponential function:</p>
<p>To determine the domain, look at the \(t\) values. The car is bought when \(t=0\), so the domain is \(t \geq 0\).</p>
<p>To determine the range, look at the \(f\)&nbsp;values, or the possible dollar values of the car. The car is bought at
  $12,000 and will lose value until the value is close to $0, but it will never be worth negative dollars.</p>
<p>The range is \(0&lt;f \leq 12000\).</p>
