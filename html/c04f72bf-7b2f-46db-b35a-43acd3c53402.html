<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p dir="ltr">In this warm-up, students practice writing an inequality to represent a constraint, reasoning about its solutions, and interpreting the solutions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To write an inequality, students need to attend carefully to verbal clues so they can appropriately model the situation. The word &ldquo;budget,&rdquo; for instance, implies that the exact amount given or any amount less than it meets a certain constraint, without explicitly stating this. Discuss how budgets can be useful as a way to measure spending in a household, at a company, or even as a government. Using budgets to measure the amount that can be spent is a useful tool for financial responsibility.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When thinking about how many pounds of food Kiran can buy, students should also recognize that the answer involves a range, rather than a single value.</p>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Kiran is getting dinner for his drama club on the evening of their final rehearsal. He plans to buy some prepared dishes from a supermarket.</p>
<ul>
<li>The budget for the dinner is $60.</li>
<li>The prepared dishes are sold by the pound, at $5.29 per pound.&nbsp;</li>
<li>He also plans to buy two large bottles of sparkling water at $2.49 each.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Represent the constraints in the situation mathematically. If you use variables, specify what each one means.</li>
<li>How many pounds of prepared dishes can Kiran buy? Explain your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<ol>
<li>\(5.29p\;+\;2(2.49)\;\leq\;60\) or \(5.29p\;+\;4.98\;\leq\;60\). \(p\) is the pounds of prepared foods Kiran could buy without going over budget.</li>
<li>Up to 10.4 pounds, or \(p\leq10.4\). For example: After removing the cost of sparkling water, Kiran still has $55.02. Dividing that amount by 5.29 gives 10.4.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Make sure students see one or more inequalities that appropriately model the situation. Then, focus the discussion on the solution set. Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;What strategy did you use to find the number of pounds of dishes Kiran could buy?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Does Kiran have to buy exactly 10.4 pounds of dishes?&rdquo; (No.) &ldquo;Can he buy less? Why or why not?&rdquo; (Yes. He can buy any amount as long as the cost of the food doesn&rsquo;t exceed $55.02. This means he can buy up to 10.4 pounds.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;What is the minimum amount he could buy?&rdquo; (He could buy 0 pounds of food, but it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense if his goal is to feed the club members.)</li>
</ul>
