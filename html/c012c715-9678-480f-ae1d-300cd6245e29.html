<h4>Domain and Range from Graphs</h4>
<p>The graph below shows the distance Carl drives from home, \(D(t)\), when \(t\) is time in seconds.</p>

  <li> What is the domain of the graph? </li>
</ol>
<p>The domain is \(x\)-values that are at least 0 and a maximum of 400.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li> What is the range of the graph? </li>
</ol>
<p>The range is the \(y\)-values that are at least 0 and a maximum of 285.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li> What are the values of \(x\) where \(D(x)=0\), and what do they mean? </li>
</ol>
<p>\(D(0)=0\) and \(D(400)=0\), and this is when Carl left home and then arrived home, so the distance was 0.</p>

  <p>Here is how to find the domain and range of the graph:</p>
  <p>The domain includes the \(x\)-values or inputs of the graph. The domain is from at least 0 to at most 10.</p>
  <p>The range includes the \(y\)-values or outputs of the graph. The range is from at least 1 to at most 3.</p>
