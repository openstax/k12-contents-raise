<p dir="ltr">In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Describe the rate of change and \(y\)-intercept for a linear model in everyday language.</li>
  <li>Use technology to find the line of best fit.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">Here are the<strong> activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;<span>3.2.1: Selecting the Best Line</span>
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you visually assessed the best line fit for data among a set of given choices. You explored bad fit, good fit, and best fit.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>3.2.2: Determining the Best Line That Fits the Data<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you distinguished between linear and nonlinear relationships in bivariate, numerical data and informally assessed the fit of a linear model. You also compared the slope and the vertical intercepts of different linear models and were able to describe the relationship between two variables.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>3.2.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>
  <li>3.2.3: Assessing the Fit of a Linear Model<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you used technology to compute a line of best fit for data given in a table and to recognize the meaning of the slope and \(y\)-intercept.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>3.2.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>
  <li>3.2.4: Working with Fitted Lines<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you had an opportunity to work with fitted lines. You identified scatter plots that showed data that would best be modeled with a linear function and the line of best fit for the data provided.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
