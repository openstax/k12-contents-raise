<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>By now, students recognize that when a quadratic equation is in the form of <em>expression</em> \(= 0\) and the expression is in factored form, the equation can be solved using the zero product property. In this activity, they encounter equations in which one side of the equal sign is not 0. To make one side equal 0 requires rearrangement. For example, to solve \(x(x+6)=8\), the equation needs to be rearranged to \(x(x+6)&minus;8=0\). Yet because the expression on the left is no longer in factored form, the zero product property won't help after all, and another strategy is needed.</p>
<p>Students recall that to solve a quadratic equation in the form of <em>expression</em> \(= 0\) is essentially to find the zeros of a quadratic function defined by that expression, and that the zeros of a function correspond to the horizontal intercepts of its graph. In the case of \(x(x+6)&minus;8=0\), the function whose zeros we want to find is defined by \(x(x+6)&minus;8\). Graphing \(y=x(x+6)&minus;8\) and examining the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph allows us to see the number of solutions and what they are.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two and provide access to graphing technology. Give students a moment to think quietly about the first question and then ask them to briefly discuss their response with their partner before continuing with the rest of the activity.</p>
<h4>Student Activity </h4>
<p>Julio is solving three equations by graphing.</p>
<p>\((x&minus;5)(x&minus;3)=0\)</p>
<p>\((x&minus;5)(x&minus;3)=-1\)</p>
<p>\((x&minus;5)(x&minus;3)=-4\)</p>
<p>To solve the first equation, \((x&minus;5)(x&minus;3)=0\), he graphed \(y=(x&minus;5)(x&minus;3)\) and then looked for the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Explain why the \(x\)-intercepts can be used to solve \((x&minus;5)(x&minus;3)=0\).&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The solutions to \((x&minus;5)(x&minus;3)=0\) are \(x\)-values that make the expression have a value of 0. At the \(x\)-intercepts, the \(y\)-value of the expression \((x&minus;5)(x&minus;3)\) is 0, so the \(x\)-intercepts give the solutions.</p>

<p>The solutions are \(x=5\) and \(x=3\).</p>
<p>To solve the second equation, Julio rewrote it as \((x&minus;5)(x&minus;3)+1=0\). He then graphed \(y=(x&minus;5)(x&minus;3)+1\).&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are no solutions for \((x&minus;5)(x&minus;3)+4=0\). The graph has no \(x\)-intercept.</p>

  <li>Why might it be helpful to rearrange each equation to equal 0 on one side and then graph the expression on the non-zero side?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> When a quadratic expression is equal to 0 and we want to find the unknown values, we can think of it as finding the zeros of a quadratic function, or finding the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph of that function.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">

</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> There are many different answers. For example:</p>
<p>\((x&minus;3)(x&minus;5)=8\), \((x&minus;3)(x&minus;5)=15\), \((x&minus;3)(x&minus;5)=24\)</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Starting at \(x=-1\), add 1, then 3, then 5, and so on, to find the next \(x\)-value that yields whole-number solutions.</p>
<p>Because the expressions \(x&minus;3\) and \(x&minus;5\) represent numbers whose difference is 2, the values of \(z\) have the form \(-1 \cdot 1\), \(0 \cdot 2\), \(1 \cdot 3\), \(2 \cdot 4\), and so on.</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Both have whole-number solutions. The values of \(x\) that produce whole-number solutions are all 1 less than a square number.</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>If students enter the equation \((x&minus;5)(x&minus;3)=0\) into their graphing technology, they may see an error message, or they may see vertical lines. The lines will intersect the \(x\)-axis at the solutions, but they are clearly not graphs of a quadratic function. Emphasize that we want to graph the function defined by \(y=(x&minus;5)(x&minus;3)\) and use its \(x\)-intercepts to find the solution to the related equation. All the points on the two vertical lines do represent solutions to the equation (because the points along each vertical line satisfy the equation regardless of the value chosen for \(y\)), but understanding this is beyond the expectations for students in this course.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their responses, graphs, and explanations on how they used the graphs to solve the equations. Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>"Are the original equation \((x&minus;5)(x&minus;3)=-1\) and the rewritten one \((x&minus;5)(x&minus;3)+1=0\) equivalent?" (Yes, the equations are equivalent. In that example, 1 is added to both sides of the original equation.) </li>
  <li>"Why might it be helpful to rearrange the equation so that one side is an expression and the other side is 0?" (It allows us to find the zeros of the function defined by that expression. The zeros correspond to the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph.) </li>
  <li>"What equation would you graph to solve this equation: \((x&minus;4)(x&minus;6)=15\)?" (\((y=(x&minus;4)(x&minus;6)&minus;15)\) "What about \((x+3)^2&minus;1=5\)?" \((y=(x+3)^2&minus;6)\) </li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure students understand that some quadratic functions have two zeros, some have one zero, and some have no zeros, so their respective graphs will have two, one, or no horizontal intercepts, respectively.</p>
<p>Likewise, some quadratic equations have two solutions, some have one solution, and some have no real solutions. (Because students won't know about numbers that aren't real until a future course, for now it is sufficient to say "no solutions.")</p>

<h4>Interpreting Graphs to Solve Quadratic Equations</h4>
<p>Let's analyze and interpret the graphs of different quadratic equations.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>First, let's look at the equation \((x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)=0\).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will graph the equation \(y=(x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)\).</p>
<p><img alt="GRAPH OF A PARABOLA THAT OPENS UP AND PASSES THROUGH THE POINTS (4, 0) AND (7, 0)." height="491" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/0f5ed86da7a118a883c063923369990eb0533368" width="491"></p>
<p>This graph has two \(x\)-intercepts.</p>
<p>The solutions to \((x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)=0\) are \(x\)-values that make the expression have a value of 0.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the \(x\)-intercepts, the \(y\)-value of the expression \((x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)\) is 0, so the \(x\)-intercepts give the solutions.</p>
<p>The \(x\)-intercepts and solutions to the equation are 4 and 7.</p>
<p>Note that the values of 4 and 7 could be referred to as solutions of the equation, \(x\)-intercepts of the graph, roots of the equation, or zeros of the equation.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Let's look at a different example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\((x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)=&minus;2.25\) </p>
<p>First, we rewrite the equation to set it equal to 0.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\((x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)+2.25=0\)</p>
<p>We will graph the equation \(y=(x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)+2.25\).</p>
<p><img alt="GRAPH OF A PARABOLA THAT OPENS UP WITH A VERTEX AT (5.5, 0)." height="461" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/1ef50a1728e0a8b372ea2439ea5d09509bbc8ad0" width="461"></p>
<p>This graph has one \(x\)-intercept. It is an example of a double root at 5.5. A double root is a root that appears twice in the solution of an algebraic equation.</p>
<p>The solution is the \(x\)-coordinate of the \(x\)-intercept.</p>
<p>So, the solution to \((x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)=&minus;2.25 is 5.5\).</p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>
<p>Let's look at one last example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\((x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)=-5\)</p>
<p>First, we rewrite the equation to set it equal to 0.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\((x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)+5=0\)</p>
<p>We will graph the equation \(y=(x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)+5\).</p>
<p><img alt="GRAPH OF A PARABOLA THAT OPENS UP. THE GRAPH DOES NOT TOUCH OR CROSS THE X-AXIS. THE GRAPH PASSES THROUGH THE POINTS (4, 5) AND (7, 5)." height="492" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/e1476e86da83ad0dfeb849b8243cc69255d2cb33" width="492"></p>
<p>The graph has no \(x\)-intercepts.</p>
<p>So, there are no real solutions for \((x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)+5=0\).</p>
<p>Remember, when a quadratic expression is equal to 0 and we want to find the unknown values, we can think of it as finding the zeros of a quadratic function, or finding the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph of that function.</p>
<h4>Try It: Interpreting Graphs to Solve Quadratic Equations</h4>
<p>Determine the number of solutions for the equation \((x&minus;4)(x&minus;9)=&minus;6.25\). Then find any solutions.</p>
<p>Use the Desmos graphing tool or technology outside the course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5> Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to analyze the graph of the equation to find any solutions:</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Rewrite the equation to set it equal to 0. <br>
  \((x&minus;4)(x&minus;9)+6.25=0\) </p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Graph the equation \(y=(x&minus;4)(x&minus;9)+6.25\). </p>
<p><img alt="GRAPH OF A PARABOLA THAT OPENS UP WITH A VERTEX AT THE POINT (6.5, 0)." height="483" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/880a2a381249f44feb8864f1a3d0e1de69bdf077" width="483"></p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Identify the \(x\)-intercepts from the graph. <br>
  There is one \(x\)-intercept at \((6.5, 0)\). <br>
  This means there is one solution. &nbsp;<br>
  The solution is 6.5. </p>
