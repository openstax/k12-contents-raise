<p>In this lesson, you will use your knowledge about arithmetic and geometric sequences to learn how to use recursive definitions to generate sequences.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Define arithmetic and geometric sequences recursively using function notation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Represent a sequence in different ways.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ask questions to get the information needed to represent a sequence in different ways.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
