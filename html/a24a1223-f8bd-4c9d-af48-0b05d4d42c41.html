<h4>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h4>
<p dir="ltr">This warm-up gives students a quick exposure to the inequalities \(x&gt;0,\;x\geq0,\;y&gt;0,\;and\;y\geq0,\)&nbsp;so that they are prepared to deal with them later in this lesson. It also reinforces the idea of thinking carefully about whether the points on the boundary lines of a solution region are included in the solution set.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Is the ordered pair (5.43, 0) a solution to all, some, or none of these inequalities? Be prepared to explain your reasoning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">\(x &gt; 0\)</p>
<p dir="ltr">\(y &gt; 0\)</p>
<p>\(x\;\geq\;0\)</p>
<p>\(y\;\geq\;0\)</p>
<p>Enter your answer to the question here:</p>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<p>Some. (5.43, 0) is a solution to \(\;x&gt;0,\;x\geq0,\) and \(y\geq0\).&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a solution to&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>\(y&gt;0\).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their responses. Then, display a blank four-quadrant coordinate plane for all to see.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Blank x-y-coordinate plane.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ask students:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>"If we were to graph the solutions to x&gt;0, what would the region look like?" (We would shade the right side of the y-axis.) "Is the y-axis included in the solution region?" (No)</li>
<li>"What about the graph of the solutions to y&gt;0?" (We would shade the upper side of the x-axis). "Is the x-axis included in the solution region?" (No)</li>
<li>"What about the graph of the solutions to the system \(x&gt;0\) and \(y&gt;0\)?" (The solution region would be the upper-right section of the graph, where the other two regions overlap.)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Remind students that this upper-right region of the coordinate plane is called the first quadrant.</p><br>
