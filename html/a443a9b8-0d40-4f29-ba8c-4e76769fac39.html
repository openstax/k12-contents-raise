<p>In this lesson, you will review what you have learned about polynomials to classify them into like terms to solve addition and subtraction problems. You will solve addition and subtraction problems using polynomial functions. You will be able to compare your work by evaluating these functions and solutions for given values.</p>
<p>Polynomials are frequently used in calculating physics problems and other real-world situations involving projectiles and the motion of objects. Mastering the polynomial operations in this unit will help you in future studies.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Determine the degree of polynomials. </li>
<li> Add and subtract polynomials. </li>
<li> Evaluate a polynomial function for a given value. </li>
<li> Add and subtract polynomial functions. </li>
</ul>
