<h4>Horizontal Transformations of Linear Functions</h4>
<p>Horizontal transformations are the result of altering the input values before applying the function rule. Vertical transformations result from altering the output values after the function rule has been applied.</p>

<h4>Example 1</h4>
<p>Describe how \( f(x) \) is transformed into \( f(x - 3) \).</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>First, graph the given function, \( f(x) \), the parent linear function.</p>
<p><img height="400" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/7c298488a153cf8edefee6e5013ed6689356bb41" alt="RAISE 4.11.5 AR Ex0 graph" title="RAISE 4.11.5 AR Ex0 graph"></p>
<p>So, let's examine an input value of \( x=2 \) using \( f(x) \).</p>
<p>For the parent function \( f(x) \), all points on the line are represented by \( (x, f(x)) \).</p>
<p>So, when \( x = 2 \), then \( f(x) \) becomes \( f(2) \). That means this point is \( (2, f(2)) \).</p>
<p>Now, let's look at what happens to our input value of \( x=2 \) when working with the \( f(x - 3) \) function.</p>
<p>The values for the points on this function are \( (x, f(x-3)) \). Therefore, when input is \( x = 2 \), the \( f(x - 3) \) becomes \( f(2 - 3) \) which is really \( f(-1) \). That means this point is located at \( (2, f(-1)) \).</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>
<p>Graph \( f(x + 2) \) when \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x - 3 \). Then, determine the equation of the transformed function.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Graph the given function, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x - 3 \).</li>
  <li>The y-intercept is (0, -3) and the slope is \(\frac{1}{2}\).</li>
  <li>For horizontal shifts, it is helpful to identify the x-intercept. On our graph, the x-intercept or zero is located at (6,0).</li>
  <li>Apply the designated transformation. Remember that the rule for a horizontal shift is \( f(x - c) \). If we rewrite \( f(x + 2) \) in an equivalent form, we can make it is easier to see \( x - c \).</li>
</ol>
<p>\( f(x + 2) = f(x - (-2)) \) That means \( c = -2 \).</p>
<p>So, \( f(x + 2) \) represents a horizontal shift of two units to the left. On our graph, we move the x-intercept two units left from (6, 0) to (4, 0).</p>

<p>The orange dashed line is the graph of the original function and the blue solid line is the transformed function.</p>
<p>Determine the equation of the transformed function.</p>
<p>The y-intercept of the transformed line is (0, -2) and the slope of the line is 2/4 or \(\frac{1}{2}\).</p>
<p>That means the equation \( f(x + 2) = \frac{1}{2}x - 2 \)</p>
<p>Want to check your work? We can check our equation algebraically by substituting \( x + 2 \) into \( f(x) \).</p>
<p>\( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x - 3 \)</p>
<p>\( f(x+2) = \frac{1}{2}(x + 2) - 3 = \frac{1}{2}x + 1 - 3 = \frac{1}{2}x - 2 \) ✔</p>

<h4>Example 3</h4>
<p>Graph \( f(4x) \) when \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x - 3 \). Then, determine the equation of the transformed function.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Graph the given function, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x - 3 \).</li>
  <li>The y-intercept is (0, -3) and the slope is \(\frac{1}{2}\).</li>
  <li>For horizontal shifts, it is helpful to identify the x-intercept. On our graph, the x-intercept or zero is located at (6,0).</li>
  <li>Apply the designated transformation. Remember that the rule for a horizontal shift is \( f(bx) \). And, when the value of \( b \) is greater than 1, the function experiences a horizontal compression.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a result of the horizontal compression, the linear function should look steeper because it is being compressed by a scale factor of 4.</p>
<p>On our graph, this means the x-intercept is compressed from (6, 0) to (1.5, 0).</p>

<p>The orange dashed line is the graph of the original function and the blue solid line is the transformed function.</p>
<p>Determine the equation of the transformed function.</p>
<p>The y-intercept of the transformed line is (0, -3) and the slope of the line is 3/1.5 or 2.</p>
<p>That means the equation \( f(4x) = 2x - 3 \).</p>
<p>Want to check your work? We can check our equation algebraically by substituting 4x into \( f(x) \).</p>
<p>\( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x - 3 \)</p>
<p>\( f(4x) = \frac{1}{2}(4x) - 3 = 2x - 3 \) ✔</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Here is how to determine the transformation:</p>
<p>Because \( f(x - c) \) defines a horizontal shift, the transformation \( f(x - 1) \) moves the parent function 1 unit to the right.</p>
