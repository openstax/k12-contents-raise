<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Explain the meaning of a solution to an equation in terms of a situation. </li>
  <li> Write a quadratic equation that represents a situation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> 8.1.1: Understanding a Situation with Quadratic Equations </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you analyzed a graph representing a situation represented by a quadratic equation. You then used the graph to describe the situation. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 8.1.2: Modeling a Quadratic Problem </li>
  <ul class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li> In this activity, you attempted to solve a problem that was represented by a quadratic equation using any method possible, including guess and check. </li>
    <li> 8.1.2: Self Check </li>
    <li> 8.1.2: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 8.1.3: Formulating a Quadratic Equation to Represent the Model </li>
  <ul class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li> In this activity, you learned how to write a quadratic equation to represent the given situation. You also learned how to interpret the solution to this equation. </li>
    <li> 8.1.3: Self Check </li>
    <li> 8.1.3: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 8.1.4: Interpreting a Solution </li>
  <ul class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li> In this activity, you used a quadratic equation to draw conclusions about a given situation. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
