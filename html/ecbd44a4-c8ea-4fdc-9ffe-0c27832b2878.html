<p>Throughout each unit, we have provided a core sampling of teaching strategies that align to the <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4e39322c11e6d04360f2bc22cf16e43c9b80e05e" target="_blank">English Language Proficiency Standards</a>. The alignments are not intended to be all inclusive. They are to demonstrate a sampling of ways to support English language learners within the math classroom. Each lesson offers ELPS aligned to at least three different domains and across the entire unit, all five ELPS domains are represented and aligned. You can pull these strategies for learning, listening, speaking, reading, and writing for any of the lessons. To see examples of teaching routines for each standard, please view the Teacher Guide for Course Level Resources.</p>
