<h2>Activity (20 minutes)</h2>

  <p>This activity prompts students to create expressions to represent the quantities and relationships in a situation and engages them in mathematical modeling.</p>
  <p>Students plan a pizza party and present a cost estimate. To do so, they need to consider relevant variables, make assumptions and estimates, perform calculations, and adjust their thinking along the way. Some students may choose to perform research and revise their models as they gather new information. There are many possible solutions to the task.</p>
  <p>As students discuss their ideas, monitor for those who:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Find and use actual data or exact values (for example, count the number of students in the class, research the cost of a large pizza at a nearby shop, or quickly survey the class for topping preferences).</li>
    <li>Estimate quantities based on prior knowledge (for example, the cost of a large pizza in a recent purchase or the number of slices they and their friends generally consume at lunch time).</li>
    <li>Make assumptions about behaviors, preferences, or quantities (for instance, assume that a certain percentage of the class prefers a certain topping).</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Launch</h3>

  <p>Ask students if they have ever been in charge of planning a party. Solicit a few ideas of what party planners need to consider. Ask students to imagine being in charge of a class pizza party. Explain that their job is to present a plan and a cost estimate for the party.</p>
  <p>Arrange students in groups of 4. Provide access to calculators and, if feasible and desired, access to the internet for researching pizza prices. Students can also make estimates based on prior experience, refer to printed ads, or use their personal device to look up pricing information.</p>
  <p>Limit the time spent on the first question to 7&ndash;8 minutes and pause the class before students move on to subsequent questions. Give groups of students 1&ndash;2 minutes to share their proposals with another group. Then, select a few groups who used contrasting strategies (such as those outlined in the Narrative) to briefly share their plans with the class. Record or display their plans for all to see.</p>
  <p>Next, ask students to complete the remaining questions. If needed, give an example of an expression that can be written to represent a cost calculation.<br></p>

<h3>Student Facing Statement</h3>

<p>Work with your group to plan what to order and to estimate what the party would cost.</p>

  <ul>
  <li>The delivery cost might change.</li>

    </ul>
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="9">
    <li>How would you convince the class to go with your group’s plan? </li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
    <p>Ordering 10 extra large pizzas is cheaper than ordering 30 small pizzas. If three people share a pizza, they can have up to three toppings or they can each get their favorite topping on their portion of the pizza. And, if someone wants more pizza, then two people can share one pizza instead of three people.

  <h4>Extending Your Thinking</h4>
  <p>A local pizzeria sells gourmet pizzas for the prices posted below. Remember the sizes are determined by the diameter of each pizza. Compare the cost per square inch of the sizes. 
  </p>
  <table class="os-raise-standardtable">
    <thead></thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Pizza size</th>
        <td>10” Small</td>
        <td>12” Medium</td>
        <td>14” Large</td>

    </tbody>
   </table>
<br>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>How did you determine the cost per square inch of each pizza? </li></ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>First, determine the total area of the pizza using the area formula for a circle, \(r^2\). Then, divide the cost of the pizza by the area measurement. The expression could be \(cr^2\), if c = cost. </p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Which size pizza is the better deal? 
  </li>  
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Xlarge</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Which size pizza is the most expensive per square inch? 
  </li>  
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> small</p>


  <h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
  
    <p>Invite groups who did not previously share their plans to share the expressions they wrote and explain what the expressions represent. After each group shares, ask if others calculated the costs the same way but wrote different expressions.</p>
    <p>As students present their expressions, record the quantities that they mention and display them for all to see. Some examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The number of students in the class</li>
      <li>The number of pizza slices per person</li>
      <li>The cost of delivery</li>
      <li>The price per topping</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Briefly discuss the quantities that students anticipate would change (and therefore would be replaced with letters).</p>
    <p>Explain to students that the expressions they have written are examples of mathematical models. They are mathematical representations of a situation in life that can be used to make sense of problems and solve them. We will look more closely at how expressions could represent the quantities in a situation like party planning, which involves certain conditions or requirements.</p>

  <h3>Translate an English Phrase to an Algebraic Expression</h3>
  <p id="fs-id1170655151082">You can use the following operation symbols to translate English phrases into algebraic expressions.&nbsp;<br></p>

    <p ><br>Look closely at these phrases using the four operations: </p>
    
      <p >the <strong>sum</strong> of&nbsp;\( a \) and&nbsp;\( b \)<br>the <strong>difference</strong> of&nbsp;\( a \)&nbsp;and&nbsp;\( b \)<br>the <strong>product</strong> of&nbsp;\( a \)&nbsp;and&nbsp;\( b \)<br>the <strong>quotient</strong> of&nbsp;\( a \)&nbsp;and&nbsp;\( b \)</p>

<p>Then, identify other phrases that represent the same algebraic concepts. Use the link below to log into the Desmos activity using the code provided by your teacher. <a href="https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/643ef5e18497c621eff91bd4" target="_blank">Link</a></p>
  
  
    <p >Each phrase tells us to operate on two numbers. Look for the words "of" and "and" to find the numbers.</p>
    <p >Later in this course, we&rsquo;ll apply our skills in algebra to solving applications. The first step will be to translate an English phrase to an algebraic expression.</p>
  

    <p><strong>Example</strong><br>
      The length of a rectangle is 14 less than the width. Let&nbsp;\( w \) represent the width of the rectangle. Write an expression for the length of the rectangle.</p>


  <p><strong>Step 1 - </strong> Write a phrase about the length of the rectangle.</p>
  <p>14 less than the width</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2 - </strong> Substitute  \(w\) for width</p>
  <p>\( w \)</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3 - </strong> Rewrite  <em>less than </em> as  <em>subtracted from </em>.</p>
  <p>14 subtracted from  <em>w </em></p>
  <p><strong>Step 4 - </strong> Translate the phrase into algebra.</p>
  <p>\( w &minus; 14 \)</p>


<h3>Try It: Translate an English Phrase to an Algebraic Expression</h3>
<p >Translate the following into an algebraic expression:&nbsp;</p>
<p >June has dimes and quarters in her purse. The number of dimes is seven less than four times the number of quarters. Let&nbsp;\( q \) represent the number of quarters. Write an expression for the number of dimes.</p>
<p >Write down your answer, then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p >Here is how to translate this into an algebraic expression:<br></p>
  <p><strong>Step 1 - </strong> Write a phrase about the number of dimes.</p>
  <p>seven less than four times the number of quarters</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2 - </strong> Substitute \( q \)  for the number of quarters.</p>
  <p>7 less than 4 times \( q \)</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3 - </strong> Translate \(4\) times \( q \).</p>
  <p>7 less than \( 4q \)</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4 - </strong> Translate the phrase into algebra. </p>
  <p>\( 4q &minus; 7 \)</p>
