<h4>Representing Everyday Situations with Graphs</h4>
<p>Graphing functions to represent everyday situations can be useful to provide a visual for what is happening in a situation.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>The graph shows the distance \(y\), in miles, for the time of each of Mia’s runs \(x\), in minutes.</p>
<p><img alt="Line graph showing distance in miles (y-axis) versus time in minutes (x-axis); the red line increases steadily from (0,0) to (20, 200), indicating a constant rate of travel." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="309" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/47e87f88703430456aedc8bf9dcbd12271521e45" width="300"/></p>
<br/>
<p>Notice that at 0 minutes, Mia has run 0 miles. At 30 minutes, Mia has run 3 miles. At 180 minutes, Mia has run 18 miles.</p>
<h4>Try It: Represent Everyday Situations with Graphs</h4>
<p>Sky spends 5 hours at the library. She is on their internet for an hour. Then she takes an hour break to read a book. She then is back online for 2 hours before her friend comes to talk for an hour. She spends her last hour at the library on the internet.</p>
