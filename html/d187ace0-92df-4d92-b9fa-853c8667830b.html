<p dir="ltr">The scatter plot shows the maximum noise level when different numbers of people are in a stadium. The linear model is given by the equation \(y = 1.5x + 22.7\), where \(y\) represents maximum noise level and \(x\) represents the number of people, in thousands, in the stadium.</p>
<p dir="ltr">\(y = 1.5x + 22.7\)</p>

<p>The \(y\)-intercept is \((0,22.7)\), which means a stadium with no people in it will have a maximum noise level of 22.7 decibels. Sample reasonings:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is actually reasonable since a whisper is about 20 decibels.</li>
<li>This is not reasonable since it should be silent with no people in the stadium.</li>
<li>This is not reasonable because the point is so far from the data that it is unlikely that the linear model will be accurate.</li>
