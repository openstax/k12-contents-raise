<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students encounter a situation where a quantity increases and then decreases. They don&rsquo;t yet
  have a name for this new pattern of change, but they recognize that it is neither linear nor exponential and that the
  graph is unlike the graph of an exponential function.</p>
<p>Students make sense of this new kind of relationship in a geometric context and describe it in concrete and
  qualitative ways. Though some students may choose to represent the relationships with calculations or with
  expressions, these are not required or emphasized in the lesson. Students will have many opportunities to reason
  symbolically about quadratic patterns in upcoming lessons.</p>
<p>Technology isn&rsquo;t required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use
  appropriate tools to solve problems, so consider making technology available.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Describe (orally and in writing) a relationship that increases and then decreases when represented by a graph.
  </li>
  <li> Given an interesting context, create drawings, tables, and graphs that represent a quadratic relationship. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Create drawings, tables, and graphs that represent the area of a garden. </li>
  <li> Recognize a situation represented by a graph that increases and then decreases. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are
  only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.
  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines. </p>
<ul>
  <li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and
    reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
  <li>A2(I) demonstrate listening comprehension of increasingly complex spoken English by following directions,
    retelling or summarizing spoken messages, responding to questions and requests, collaborating with peers, and taking
    notes commensurate with content and grade-level needs</li>
  <li>A3(B) expand and internalize initial English vocabulary by learning and using high-frequency English words
    necessary for identifying and describing people, places, and objects, by retelling simple stories and basic
    information represented or supported by pictures, and by learning and using routine language needed for classroom
    communication</li>
  <li>A3(C) speak using a variety of grammatical structures, sentence lengths, sentence types, and connecting words with
    increasing accuracy and ease as more English is acquired</li>
  <li>A3(G) express opinions, ideas, and feelings ranging from communicating single words and short phrases to
    participating in extended discussions on a variety of social and grade-appropriate academic topics</li>
  <li>A3(H) narrate, describe, and explain with increasing specificity and detail as more English is acquired</li>
  <li>A4(D) use prereading supports such as graphic organizers, illustrations, and pretaught topic-related vocabulary
    and other prereading activities to enhance comprehension of written text</li>
</ul>
<h4>Support for Building Character</h4>
