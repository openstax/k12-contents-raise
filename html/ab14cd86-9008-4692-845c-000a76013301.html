<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students encounter a situation where a quantity increases and then decreases. They don&rsquo;t yet have a name for this new pattern of change, but they recognize that it is neither linear nor exponential and that the graph is unlike the graph of an exponential function.</p>
<p>Students make sense of this new kind of relationship in a geometric context and describe it in concrete and qualitative ways. Though some students may choose to represent the relationships with calculations or with expressions, these are not required or emphasized in the lesson. Students will have many opportunities to reason symbolically about quadratic patterns in upcoming lessons.</p>
<p>Technology isn&rsquo;t required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate tools to solve problems, so consider making technology available.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Describe (orally and in writing) a relationship that increases and then decreases when represented by a graph. </li>
  <li> Given an interesting context, create drawings, tables, and graphs that represent a quadratic relationship. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Create drawings, tables, and graphs that represent the area of a garden. </li>
  <li> Recognize a situation represented by a graph that increases and then decreases. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>
<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson. Encourage students to look for these words and notice their use and meanings. </li>
  <li> Encourage students to use key vocabulary words in &ldquo;math talk&rdquo; and their written and oral explanations. </li>
  <li> Utilize a word wall. Sample cards are located here: <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/8ed3aa68763498713b44d3c2e537ffe61b4755f0" target="_blank">Mathematics Vocabulary Word Wall Cards</a> </li>

<h4>Support for Building Character</h4>
<p>Throughout this unit, find ways to encourage and support students to work on cultivating their <strong>proactivity</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to try during this lesson:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://characterlab.org/tips-of-the-week/the-adaptability-advantage/" target="_blank">The Adaptability Advantage</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="https://characterlab.org/tips-of-the-week/unrecognized-strengths/" target="_blank">Unrecognized Strengths</a> </li>
</ul>
