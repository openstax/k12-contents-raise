<p>In this lesson, you will activate and build on what you have learned about solving by <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">substitution</span>, or replacing a variable with a number or with an expression. Various substitutions can be done to solve the same system. You will also begin to build an awareness of the kinds of systems that are conducive to being solved by substitution.</p>

<p>Below are the knowledge and skills you will practice in this lesson. Before you begin, read each one and rate how much you currently know about each one. It’s okay if your ratings are low; the purpose of this is to check in with yourself about what you do or do not yet know.</p>









<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Solve systems of equations by substituting a variable or an expression.</li>
  <li>Know more than one way to perform a substitution and decide which way or what to substitute based on how the given equations are written.</li>
</ul>
