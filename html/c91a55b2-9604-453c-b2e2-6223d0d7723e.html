<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>Earlier in the lesson, students explored key features of the graphs of functions and what they mean in the context of a real life situation. Now, students will focus specifically on the graphs of linear functions. Students will identify \(x\)-intercepts as zeros, \(y\)-intercepts, and slopes.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Give students a few minutes of quiet time to think individually, and then time to discuss their response with their partner.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis
</h4>
<p>Have student pairs share their answers. The first question focuses on the intercepts. This is an opportunity to help students identify intercepts. Ask students:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>How can you identify the \(x\)-intercept from the graph? (It is the point where the graph crosses the \(x\)-axis.)
  </li>
  <li>Which coordinate of the \(x\)-intercept is zero? (The \(y\)-coordinate is zero.)
  </li>
  <li>How can you identify the \(y\)-intercept from the graph? (It is the point where the graph crosses the \(y\)-axis.)
  </li>
  <li>Which coordinate of the \(y\)-intercept is zero? (The \(x\)-coordinate is zero.)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The second question focuses on the meaning of the \(y\)-intercept in context and the slope. Ask students:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>How do you interpret the meaning of the \(y\)-intercept in content? (The \(x\)-values represent days and the \(y\)-values represent the amount of money he saves. So the point (\(0, 3)\) represents that he started on day zero with $3.) 
  </li>
  <li>How do you find the slope using the graph? (Use rise over run to count from one point on the graph to another point on the graph. From \((0, 3)\) count over 1 and up 3 to \((1, 6)\), so the slope is 3.)
  </li>
  <li>How do you interpret the meaning of the slope in context? (The slope in the change in \(y\), amount saved, over the change in \(x\), the number of days. So for each day, the amount saved is $3.)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The third question focuses on labeling the graph. To help students identify the key features, ask:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are the coordinates of the point labeled \(a\)? \((0, 2)\) What key feature has zero and the \(x\)-coordinate? (The \(y\)-intercept has an \(x\)-coordinate of zero.)
  </li>
  <li>What are the coordinates of the point labeled \(b\)? \((-6, 0)\) What key feature has zero and the \(y\)-coordinate? (The \(x\)-intercept has a \(y\)-coordinate of zero.)
  </li>
  <li>What are the coordinates of the point labeled \(c\)? \((0, 0)\) What key feature of a graph has coordinates \((0, 0)\)? (The origin has coordinates \((0, 0)\).)
  </li>
  <li>What does \(\frac31\) represent in the graph? (\(\frac31\) is rise over run and represents the slope of the line.) 
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Features of Linear Functions</h4>
<p><img alt class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="287" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/d2528fdbf66913acdf643a44889ebba7613b3d35" width="300"></p>
<p>The graph of a linear function forms a line that goes on forever in both directions. Since the ends go to infinity and negative infinity, linear functions do not have maximums or minimums, unless their domain is restricted to a specific part of the graph.</p>
<p>You can still pick out key features of linear functions.</p>
<p>The \(x\)-intercept, or zero, is where the line crosses the \(x\)-axis. This is where the \(y\)-coordinate is 0.</p>
<p>In this linear function, the \(x\)-intercept, or zero, is \(x= 2\) and written as the point \((2,0)\).</p>
<p>The \(y\)-intercept is where the line crosses the \(y\)-axis and the \(x\)-coordinate is 0.</p>
<p>In this linear function, the \(y\)-intercept is \(y=4\) and written as the point \((0,4)\).</p>
<p>The slope of the line can be found as in previous units as the change in&nbsp;\(y\)<em>&nbsp;</em>over the change in&nbsp;\(x\).&nbsp;</p>
<p>\(\mathrm m=\;\frac{\mathrm{rise}}{\mathrm{run}}=\;\frac{\mathrm{change}\;\mathrm{in}\;\mathrm y}{\mathrm{change}\;\mathrm{in}\;\mathrm x}\)</p>
<p>The slope of this linear function is \(m= \frac{4}{-2}=\frac{-4}{2} =-2\).</p>

<p>Find the \(x\)-intercept and \(y\)-intercept of the linear function graphed below. Write each answer as a point.</p>
<p><img alt class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="287" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/3a846a909d6e4ffde27212c03128bea3a91b03c8" width="300"></p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong> Solution</strong></p>
<p>Here is how to find the intercepts of a linear function:</p>
<p>Since the line crosses the \(x\)-axis at about \((-2.75, 0)\), that is the \(x\)-intercept.</p>
<p>Since the line crosses the \(y\)-axis at \((0,2)\), that is the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
