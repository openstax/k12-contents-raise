<p><strong><em>Students will complete the following questions to practice the skills they have learned in this lesson.</em></strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>The height of a diver above the water is given by \(h(t)=-5t2+10t+3, where \(t\) is time measured in seconds and \(h(t)\) is measured in meters. <strong>Select two</strong> statements that are true about the situation.
    <ul>
      <li> The diver begins 5 meters above the water. </li>
      <li> The diver begins 3 meters above the water. </li>
      <li> The function has 1 zero that makes sense in this situation. </li>
      <li> The function has 2 zeros that make sense in this situation. </li>
      <li> The graph that represents \(h\) starts at the origin and curves upward. </li>
      <li> The diver begins at the same height as the water level. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>The diver begins 3 meters above the water. The function has 1 zero that makes sense in this situation.</p>

  <li>Two rocks are launched straight up in the air. The height of Rock A is given by the function \(f\), where \(f(t)=4+30t-16ta^2\). The height of Rock B is given by \(g\), where \(g(t)=5+20t-16t^2\). In both functions, \(t\) is time measured in seconds and height is measured in feet.</li>

  <li> Determine which rock hits the ground first.
    <ul>
      <li> Rock A </li>
      <li> Rock B </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Rock B hits the ground first. The graph for Rock B (\(g(t)=5+20t-16t^2 function\)) crosses the x-axis at about 1.5, which means it hits the ground about 1.5 seconds after launch. The graph for Rock A \((f(t)=4+30t-16t^2 function\)) crosses the \(x\)-axis at about 2, which means it hits the ground about 2 seconds after launch.</p>
