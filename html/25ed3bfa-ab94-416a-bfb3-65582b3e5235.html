<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>It is recommended to use the digital version of this activity. The mathematical purpose of this activity is for students to use technology to compute a line of best fit for data given in a table and to understand the meaning of the slope and \(y\)-intercept. If the digital version of the activity is not available, the students should be guided through using available technology to find the least-squares regression line as the line of best fit.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Provide <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/96f69d5264524fbfff74b9c44a37956d1e7a28e0" target="_blank">data tables</a> for the graphs for the cards from the previous activity that fit well with a linear model. Assign one table to each group. For students using the paper task, show them how to use technology to create a scatter plot of the data in a table. After groups have had a chance to estimate the best fit lines, pause the class. Show students how to use technology to find the least-squares regression line for data and display the line with the scatter plot.</p>
<p>Display the tables for students to use for the last question:</p>

  <li> Is this a good estimate for the data? Be prepared to share your reasoning. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>

<p>This may be a good estimate for the data since the points seem close to the line, but something different might happen when the temperature gets below freezing, so it’s possible that when only 10 pounds of ice cream are sold, the relationship with the weather may be different.</p>

  <li>Priya creates a scatter plot of the data using the distance, \(x\), and the price, \(y\). She determines that a linear model is appropriate to use with the data. Use technology to find the equation of a line of best fit.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(y=1.57x+7.6\)&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Interpret the slope and the \(y\)-intercept of the equation of the line of best fit in this situation.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. The slope means that the fare increases by $1.57 for each additional mile driven. The \(y\)-intercept means that the fee for getting in the car is approximately $7.60.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Use the line of best fit to estimate the cost of a 3.6-mile trip. Will this estimate be close to the actual value? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. According to the line of best fit, the cost of a 3.6-mile trip is approximately $13.25, which is the same price as the 3.5-mile trip listed in the table.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>On her next trip, Priya tries a new ride service and travels 3.6 miles, but she pays only $4.00 because she receives a discount. Include this trip in the table and calculate the equation of the line of best fit for the 11 trips. Did the slope of the equation of the line of best fit increase, decrease, or stay the same? Why? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. The slope of the line decreased to $1.27 for each additional mile. It probably decreased because $4.00 is a far lower price per mile than any of her other trips because of the discount. This causes the slope, the increase in price for each additional mile, to decrease.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>Priya uses the new ride service for her 12th trip. She travels 4.1 miles and is charged $24.75. How do you think the slope of the equation of the line of best fit will change when this 12th trip is added to the table?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. The slope of the line will probably increase because $24.75 is very expensive and will likely cause the cost for each additional mile to increase.</p>
<br>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may struggle with interpreting slope and \(y\)-intercept. Remind students of how each relates to a situation. To help students interpret slope, ask them: &ldquo;What does the \(x\) variable represent? What does the \(y\) variable represent? How is slope connected to the \(x\) and \(y\) variables? What happens to \(x\) as \(y\) increases (or decreases)?&rdquo; To help students interpret the&nbsp;\(y\)-intercept, ask them: &ldquo;What does the point \((20,6)\) mean in the scatter plot? What are the coordinates of the \(y\)-intercept? What does each of the coordinates mean in the situation described? What is the \(y\)-value when \(x\) is 0? Which variable has a value of 0? Which variable is represented with \(y\)?&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>The purpose of this discussion is for students to make connections between the scatter plot and the equation of the line of best fit. Display each scatter plot, the line of best fit, and the equation of the line of best fit.</p>

  </li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some questions for discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;How does using technology help model the data in the scatter plot?&rdquo; (It allows different people to come up with the same equation for the line of best fit. If the line is just drawn by hand, there can be different linear equations that seem to fit the data well, but there is only one &ldquo;best&rdquo; fit line.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;What does the \(y\)-intercept represent in each scatter plot? When is it reasonable to use this interpretation?&rdquo; (It represents the value of \(y\) estimated by the linear model when \(x=0\). When the intercept is near the range of the data, it can be reasonable to use this interpretation because otherwise, the linear trend may not continue. There are also some situations in which a value of 0 for \(x\) does not make sense.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Why is the slope the same in scatter plot A and scatter plot F?&rdquo; (It is the same because the data in scatter plot F are the same data as in scatter plot A, except that the values for \(y\) have all been increased by 4.5 units.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Tell students they should be careful when predicting values outside the range of the data&mdash;in particular, for the \(y\)-intercept. Even when the data are fit well by a linear model, the behavior of the variables farther away may not be linear. It is important to remember that all predictions using the best fit line are estimates and the reasonableness of the predictions should be considered.</p>

<p>Using technology, the line of best fit for the data is \(y=3.02x +154.68\).</p>

</p>
<p>The \(y\)-intercept is 154.68, which doesn&rsquo;t quite make sense for a crocodile that weighs 0 pounds but does give a minimum bite force to expect from a crocodile.<br>

<p>The following table gives the times of the gold, silver, and bronze medal winners for the men&rsquo;s 100-meter race (in seconds) for the past 10 Olympic Games.</p>
<p>Use technology to write an equation of the line that represents the line of best fit for the years since 1976 and the mean times each year. Round to the nearest hundredth.</p>
