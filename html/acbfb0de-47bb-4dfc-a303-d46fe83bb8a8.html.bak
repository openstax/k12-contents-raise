<h4>Distinguish Linear Patterns from Nonlinear Patterns </h4>
<p dir="ltr">A scatter plot is a graph of numerical data with two variables. If two variables vary together in a predictable way, we say there is a statistical relationship between the two variables. </p>
<ul>
<li>When the points of the scatter plot seem to fall along a line, the scatter plot is linear.</li>
<li>Nonlinear patterns seem to follow a curve. </li>
<li>If the scatter plot shows no pattern, it means there is no relationship between the variables.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Try It: Distinguish Linear Patterns from Nonlinear Patterns</h4>
<p>At a dinner party, every person shakes hands with every other person present. The scatter plot shows the number of people, x, and the number of handshakes, y.  </p>
<p><strong><img alt="Scatter plot illustrating the relationship between the number of people and the number of handshakes. The data show a positive upward trend that is growing at a faster rate as the number of people increases." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="181" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/f75b365e843b9eca4764d2fd68d460e731c50fed" width="200"/></strong></p>

<p>Here is how to describe the relationship:</p>
<p>The scatter plot shows that the number of handshakes increases as the number of people increases. The increase is not at a constant rate, so the relationship is nonlinear.</p>

<p>Incorrect. Let’s try again a different way: The points form a linear pattern that increases from left and right. The answer is there is an increasing linear pattern.</p>
