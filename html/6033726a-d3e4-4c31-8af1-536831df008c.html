<h4>Cool Down Activity</h4>
<p>A school choir needs to make T-shirts for its 75 members and has set aside some money in their budget to pay for them. The members of the choir decided to order from a printing company that charges $3 per shirt, plus a $50 fee for each color to be printed on the shirts.</p>
<span>1. Write an equation that represents the relationship between the number of T-shirts ordered, the number of colors on the shirts, and the total cost of the order. If you use a </span><strong>variable</strong><span>, specify what it represents.</span><br>
<div class="os-raise-ib-input" data-button-text="Submit" data-schema-version="1.0">
  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-content">
    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->

  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-ack">
    <p>Check your work:</p>
    <p><span>\( 75 \cdot 3 + 50𝑥 = 𝐷 \)&nbsp;(or equivalent)&nbsp;</span><br></p>
    <p>\( 𝑥 \)&nbsp;represents the number of colors on the shirts.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>\( D \)&nbsp;represents the total cost in dollars.</p>
  </div>

<br>
<p>2. In this situation, which quantities do you think can vary? Which might be fixed?<br>

    <p>The cost per shirt and the fee per color are fixed (they are set by the printing company). The number of colors on the shirts can vary, and so can the total cost, depending on the number of colors being printed.</p>
