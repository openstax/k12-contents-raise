<h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>
<p>In earlier lessons, students wrote and solved linear inequalities in one variable. In this lesson, they transition to linear inequalities in two variables.</p>
<p>Previously, students learned that the solutions to an equation in two variables are all pairs of values that make the equation true, and that, when graphed, the solutions are points on a line. Here, they learn that the solutions to inequalities in two variables also involve pairs of values. When graphed, the solutions are no longer points on a single line, but comprise a region that is bounded by a line. This region consists of all points in a plane on one side of a boundary line. That boundary line is the graph of an equation related to the inequality.</p>
<p>Students begin by noticing that the plots of solutions and non-solutions occupy different parts of a coordinate plane. Next, they think about the boundary line between the two regions and whether it is a part of the solution. Finally, students write some inequalities given graphs that represent solution regions.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h3>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span>Determine the solution region to an inequality in two variables by testing the points on the line and on either side of the line, given the graph of a related equation.</span><br></li>
  <li>Explain that the solutions to a linear inequality in two variables are represented graphically as a half-plane bounded by a line.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><span>Determine which side of the line the solutions to the inequality will fall, given a two-variable inequality and the graph of the related equation.</span><br></li>
  <li>Describe the graph that represents the solutions to a linear inequality in two variables.</li>
</ul>

  <h3>Required Materials</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Colored pencils</li>
    <li>Optional: graphing calculator</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Required Preparation</h3>
  <p>The colored pencils are optional. If used in the first activity, each student needs 2 different colors. As an alternative to 2 colors, students could just write two different symbols.<br></p>

  <h3>Lesson Vocabulary</h3>
  <p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson. Encourage students to look for these words and notice their use and meanings.</li>
    <li>Encourage students to use key vocabulary words in &ldquo;math talk&rdquo; and their written and oral explanations.</li>
    <li>Utilize a word wall. Sample cards are located here: <a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/instruction/mathematics/resources/vocab_cards/" target="_blank">Mathematics Vocabulary Word Wall Cards</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Vocabulary words that are emphasized in this lesson include:</p>
  <p><strong>Previous Vocabulary:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>inequality</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>New Vocabulary:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>linear inequality</li>
    <li>solution to a linear inequality</li>
    <li>boundary line</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>Support for Building Character</h3>
