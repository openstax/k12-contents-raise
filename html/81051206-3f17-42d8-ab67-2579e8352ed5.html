<h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>
<p>In earlier lessons, students wrote and solved linear inequalities in one variable. In this lesson, they transition to linear inequalities in two variables.</p>
<p>Previously, students learned that the solutions to an equation in two variables are all pairs of values that make the equation true, and that, when graphed, the solutions are points on a line. Here, they learn that the solutions to inequalities in two variables also involve pairs of values. When graphed, the solutions are no longer points on a single line, but comprise a region that is bounded by a line. This region consists of all points in a plane on one side of a boundary line. That boundary line is the graph of an equation related to the inequality.</p>
<p>Students begin by noticing that the plots of solutions and non-solutions occupy different parts of a coordinate plane. Next, they think about the boundary line between the two regions and whether it is a part of the solution. Finally, students write some inequalities given graphs that represent solution regions.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Determine the solution region to an inequality in two variables by testing the points on the line and on either side of the line, given the graph of a related equation.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Explain that the solutions to a linear inequality in two variables are represented graphically as a half-plane bounded by a line.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Determine which side of the line the solutions to the inequality will fall, given a two-variable inequality and the graph of the related equation.</li>
  <li>Describe the graph that represents the solutions to a linear inequality in two variables.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>
<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2.10.1: Using Computation and Reasoning</li>
  <li>2.10.2: Finding Solutions to Inequalities on the Coordinate Plane
    <ul>
      <li>2.10.2: Self Checkh4</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>2.10.2: Additional Resources</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>2.10.3: Sketching Solutions to Inequalities
    <ul>
      <li>2.10.3: Self Checkh4</li>
      <li>2.10.3: Additional Resources</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>2.10.4: Shading Boundary Line Regions</li>
</ul>
<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 2.10.5: Practice.</p>
<h4>Required Materials</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Colored pencils</li>
  <li>Optional: graphing calculator</li>
</ul>
<h4>Required Preparation</h4>
<p>The colored pencils are optional. If used in the first activity, each student needs 2 different colors. As an alternative to 2 colors, students could just write two different symbols.<br>
</p>
<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>
<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson. Encourage students to look for these words and notice their use and meanings.</li>
  <li>Encourage students to use key vocabulary words in &ldquo;math talk&rdquo; and their written and oral explanations.</li>
  <li>Utilize a word wall. Sample cards are located here: <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/8ed3aa68763498713b44d3c2e537ffe61b4755f0" target="_blank">Mathematics Vocabulary Word Wall Cards</a></li>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners </h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines. </p>
<ul>
  <li>A1(E) internalize new basic and academic language by using and reusing it in meaningful ways in speaking and writing activities that build concept and language attainment </li>
  <li>A2(D) monitor understanding of spoken language during classroom instruction and interactions and seek clarification as needed </li>
  <li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment </li>
  <li>A3(C) speak using a variety of grammatical structures, sentence lengths, sentence types, and connecting words with increasing accuracy and ease as more English is acquired </li>
  <li>A3(H) narrate, describe, and explain with increasing specificity and detail as more English is acquired </li>
  <li>A3(I) adapt spoken language appropriately for formal and informal purposes </li>
</ul>
<h4>Support for Building Character</h4>
<p>Throughout this unit, find ways to encourage and support students to work on cultivating their <strong>growth mindset.</strong></p>
<p>Here are some tips to try during this lesson:</p>
