<p><strong><em>Students will complete the following questions to practice the skills they have learned in this lesson.</em></strong></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="1" type="1">
<li>The total monthly cost of a cell phone plan from Company \(C\) costs $10, plus $15 per gigabyte for data used. The total monthly cost from Company \(D\) costs $80 with unlimited data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Rule \(C\) gives the monthly cost, in dollars, of using \(g\) gigabytes of data on Company \(C\)’s plan. Rule \(D\) gives the monthly cost, in dollars, of using \(g\) gigabytes of data on Company \(D\)’s plan. </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="1" type="a">
<li>Which sentence describes the meaning of the statement \(C(2)=40\)?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>It costs $40 to use 2 gigabytes of data using plan \(C\). </li>
<li>It costs $40 to use 2 gigabytes of data using plan \(D\).</li>
<li>It costs $2 to use 40 gigabytes of data using plan \(C\).</li>
<li>It costs $2 to use 40 gigabytes of data using plan \(D\).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> It costs $40 to use 2 gigabytes of data using plan \(C\). </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2" type="a">
<li>Which is less, \(C(4)\) or \(D(4)\)? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>\(C(4)\) is less. \(C(4)=70\) and \(D(4)=80\). The phone plan from Company C is less expensive if 4 gigabytes of data are used.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3" type="a">
<li>Which is less, \(C(5)\) or \(D(5)\)?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>\(D(5)\) is less. \(D(5)=80\) and \(C(5) =85\). The phone plan from Company D is less expensive if 5 gigabytes of data are used.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4" type="a">
<li>For what number \(g\) is \(C(g)=130\)?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong> 8 </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2" type="1">
<li>Function \(G\) takes a student’s first name for its input and gives the number of letters in the first name for its output.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="1" type="a">
<li>Find the value of of \(G(\text{Jada})=4\). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>The name “Jada” has 4 letters.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2" type="a">
<li>Find the value of \(G(\text{Diego})\). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>5 </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3" type="1">
<li>Is the following graph a function? </li>
</ol>
<br/>
<p><img alt="The figure has an absolute value function graphed on the x y-coordinate plane. The \(x\)-axis runs from negative 4 to 4. The y-axis runs from negative 0 to 8. The vertex is at the point (0, negative 1).

<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Yes, this is a function because the graph passes the vertical line test.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4" type="1">
<li>Is the following graph a function? <br/></li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="The figure has a half-circle graphed on the x y-coordinate plane. The x-axis runs from negative 8 to 8. The y-axis runs from negative 8 to 8.

</ol>
<p><img alt="The figure has two curved lines graphed on the x y-coordinate plane. The x-axis runs from negative 8 to 8. The y-axis runs from negative 8 to 8. The curved line on the left goes through the points (negative 2, 0), (negative 4, 5), and (negative 4, negative 5). The curved line on the right goes through the points (2, 0), (4, 5), and (4, negative 5)." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b27425bc88681f1b290617df73d1d63458f6116c"/></p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>No, this is not a function because the graph does not pass the vertical line test. </p>
