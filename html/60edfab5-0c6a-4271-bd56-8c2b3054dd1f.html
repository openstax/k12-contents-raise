<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>In previous activities and lessons, students have worked on manipulating the different quadratic forms to find equivalent equations. In this activity, students will write the equation of a quadratic function in vertex form given a point and a vertex. Ask the class for the vertex form of a quadratic and display it on the board for reference throughout the activity.</p>

<h4>Video: Writing an Quadratic Equation from a Vertex and a Point</h4>
<p>Watch the following video to learn more about writing a quadratic equation from a vertex and a point.</p>
<p>[[insert media lesson 9.9.3]]</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may not substitute the points in the correct places in the formula. It can be helpful for students to write the vertex in one color and point in another and also color code the vertex formula to match so \(h\) and \(k\) are the color of the vertex point and \(x\) and \(y\) are the color of the additional point.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>If time allows, have students create their own problems where they choose a vertex and a point and have their partners write the equation in vertex form. Partners can also try to &ldquo;stump&rdquo; other partners. As an extension, have students use graphing technology to graph the point and vertex of each quadratic and graph the quadratic to see how the graph connects to the equation and the points also lie on the parabola. This can also provide time to quickly discuss any key characteristics in the graphs that were discussed in unit 7 and earlier in unit 9.</p>

<h4>Creating Vertex Form from a Vertex and a Point</h4>
<p>Write the quadratic in vertex form that has a vertex at \((3, 4)\) and goes through the point \((1, 2)\).</p>
<p>First start with the vertex form of a quadratic function.</p>
<p>\(y=a(x-h)^2+k\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 </strong>- Substitute the vertex in at \((h, k)\).<br>
\(y=a(x-3)^2+4\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Substitute the other point at \((x, y)\).<br>
\(2=a(1-3)^2+4\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 </strong>- Solve for \(a\).<br>
\(2=a(1-3)^2+4\)<br>
\(2=a(-2)^2+4\)<br>
\(2=a(4)+4\)<br>
\(2-4=a(4)+4-4\)<br>
\(-2=a(4)\)<br>
\(-\frac24=\frac{a(4)}{4}\)<br>
\(a=-\frac12\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Substitute the value of \(a\) value and the vertex \((h, k)\) into the vertex form.<br>
\(y=-\frac12(x-3)^2+4\)</p>
<br>
<h4>Try It: Creating Vertex Form from a Vertex and a Point</h4>
<p>Write the quadratic in vertex form that has a vertex at \((2, 5)\) and goes through the point \((3, 7)\).</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(y=2(x-2)^2+5\)<br>
First start with the vertex form of a quadratic function.<br>
\(y=a(x-h)^2+k\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Substitute the vertex in at \((h, k)\).<br>
\(y=a(x-2)^2+5\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Substitute the other point at \((x, y)\).<br>
\(7=a(3-2)^2+5\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Solve for \(a\).<br>
\(7=a(1)^2+5\)<br>
\(7-5=a(1)^2+5-5\)<br>
\(a=2\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Substitute the value of \(a\) value and the vertex \((h, k)\) into the vertex form.<br>
\(y=2(x-2)^2+5\)</p>
