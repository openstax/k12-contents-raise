<p>To help students summarize and organize the insights they gained in the lesson, consider asking them to complete (collaboratively in small groups or as a class) a graphic organizer with the following components for each type of system (no solutions, many solutions, and one solution).</p>
<p><strong>A System with ________________________ (One, No, Many) Solutions(s)</strong></p>

<table class="os-raise-textheavytable">
  <thead>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Meaning:</strong> What does it mean for a system to have (one, no, many) solutions?</td>
      <td><strong>Equations: </strong>What are some characteristics of the equations in such a system? (Give an example if possible.)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Graphs:</strong> What are some characteristics of the graphs of the equations in the system? (Sketch an example if possible.)</td>
      <td><strong>Solutions:</strong> What would we get when solving the system of equations algebraically? (Give an example if possible.)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If time is limited, focus on describing some characteristics of the equations in a system with each number of solutions (one, many, none) and sketching their graphs. Consider using a graphic organizer such as this one.</p>

<table class="os-raise-doubleheadertable">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col"></th>
      <th scope="col"><strong>Graphs:</strong> What are some characteristics of the graphs of the equations in the system? (Sketch an example if possible.)</th>
      <th scope="col"><strong>Solutions:</strong> What would we get when solving the system of equations algebraically? (Give an example if possible.)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
     <tr>
      <th scope="row">One Solution</th>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Many Solutions</th>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">No Solutions</th>
