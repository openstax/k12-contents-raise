<p>To help students summarize and organize the insights they gained in the lesson, consider asking them to complete (collaboratively in small groups or as a class) a graphic organizer with the following components for each type of system (no solutions, many solutions, and one solution).</p>
<p><strong>A System with ________________________ (One, No, Many) Solutions(s)</strong></p>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Meaning:</strong> What does it mean for a system to have (one, no, many) solutions?</td>
      <td><strong><span>Equations</span><span>:</span>&nbsp;</strong>What are some characteristics of the equations in such a system? (Give an example if possible.)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Graphs:</strong>&nbsp;What are some characteristics of the graphs of the equations in the system? (Sketch an example if possible.)</td>
