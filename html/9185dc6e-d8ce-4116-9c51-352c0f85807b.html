<h4>Writing Recursive Definitions</h4>
<p>Sometimes we can define a sequence recursively. That is, we can describe how to calculate the next term in a sequence if we know the previous term.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a sequence: 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, . . . This is an arithmetic sequence, where each term is 4 more than the previous term. Since sequences are functions, let&rsquo;s call this sequence \(f\). Then we can use function notation to write \(f(n)=f(n-1)+4\). Here, \(f(n)\) is the term, \(f(n-1)\) is the previous term, and + 4 represents the common difference since \(f\) is an arithmetic sequence.</p>
<p>When we define a function recursively, we must also say what the first term is. Without that, there would be no way of knowing if the sequence defined by \(f(n)=f(n-1)+4\) started with 6 or 81 or any other number. Here, one possible initial condition is \(f(1)=6\). It could also make sense to number the terms starting with 0, using \(f(0)=6\).</p>
<p>Combining this information gives the recursive definition: \(f(1)=6\) and \(f(n)=f(n-1)+4\) for \(n\geq2\), where \(n\) is an integer. We include the \(n\geq2\) at the end since the value of \(f\) at 1 is already given, and the other terms in the sequence are generated by inputting integers larger than 1 into the definition.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some examples from the first activity and write the recursive definition for each type of sequence:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>
    A: 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, . . .
    <br>
    <br>
    Arithmetic<br>
    <br>
    \(A(1)=30, A(n)=A(n-1)+10, n\geq2\)
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>
    B: 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 2.5, . . .
    <br>
    <br>
    Geometric<br>
    <br>
    \(B(1)=80, B(n)=B(n-1) \frac12, n\geq2\)
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>
    F: 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, . . .
    <br>
    <br>
    Neither<br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Try It: Writing Recursive Definitions</h4>
<p>Write \(E(1)\) and a recursive definition for \(E(n)\):</p>
<br>
<div class="os-raise-ib-cta" data-button-text="Solution" data-fire-event="Reveal1" data-schema-version="1.0">
  <div class="os-raise-ib-cta-content">
    <p>E: 20, 13, 6, &ndash;1, &ndash;8, . . .</p>
  </div>
  <div class="os-raise-ib-cta-prompt">
    <p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="os-raise-ib-content" data-schema-version="1.0" data-wait-for-event="Reveal1">
  <p>Here is how to write the recursive definition for this sequence:</p>
  <p>\(E(1)=20\), then each term after is formed by subtracting 7, so \(E(n)=E(n-1)-7\), \(n\geq2\).</p>
</div>
