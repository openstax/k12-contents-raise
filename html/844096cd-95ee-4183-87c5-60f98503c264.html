<p>In this lesson, you will learn how to write terms that include rational exponents as radicals and vice versa.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Simplify radical expressions with even and odd indexes. </li>
<li> Rewrite expressions with rational exponents as roots. </li>
<li> Use properties for exponents with rational exponents.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
