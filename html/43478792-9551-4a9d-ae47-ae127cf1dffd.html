<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>This lesson serves two goals. The first is to relate the work in the past couple of lessons on quadratic expressions back to the quadratic functions that represent situations. Now students have additional insights that enable them to show (algebraically) that two different expressions can define the same function.</p>
<p>The second goal is to prompt students to notice connections between different forms of quadratic expressions and features of the graphs that represent the expressions. Students are asked to identify the \(x\)- and \(y\)-intercepts of graphs representing expressions in standard and factored form. They observe that some numbers in the expressions are related to the intercepts and hypothesize about the patterns they observe. This work sets the foundation for upcoming lessons, in which students look more closely at how the parameters of quadratic expressions are related to their graphs.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Coordinate (orally and in writing) a quadratic expression given in factored form and the intercepts of its graph. </li>
  <li> Interpret (orally and in writing) the meaning of \(x\)-intercepts and \(y\)-intercepts on a graph of a quadratic function that represents a context. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Explain the meaning of the intercepts on a graph of a quadratic function in terms of the situation it represents. </li>
  <li> Explain how the numbers in the factored form of a quadratic expression relate to the intercepts of its graph. </li>
</ul>

<h4 >Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p>
<ul>
  <li> ELPS 1(C) use strategic learning techniques such as concept mapping, drawing, memorizing, comparing, contrasting, and reviewing to acquire basic and grade-level vocabulary </li>
  <li> ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment </li>
  <li> ELPS 3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions </li>
  <li> ELPS 3(H) narrate, describe, and explain with increasing specificity and detail as more English is acquired</li>
</ul>
