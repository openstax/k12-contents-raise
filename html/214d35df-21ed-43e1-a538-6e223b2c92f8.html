<p>To help students consolidate the ideas in this lesson, consider asking them to reflect on some or all of the following questions in writing or by discussing with a partner:</p>
<p>A quadratic function \(k\) is defined by \(k(x)=(x-100)(x+20)\). How would you explain to a friend who is absent today how to use the equation to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Find the zeros of the function? </li>
<li> Find the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph? </li>
<li> Find the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex without graphing? </li>
<li> Find the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex without graphing? </li>
<li> Find the \(y\)-intercept of the graph? </li>
</ul>
