<p>To help students consolidate the ideas in this lesson, consider asking them to reflect on some or all of the following questions in writing or by discussing with a partner:</p>
<p>A quadratic function \(k\) is defined by \(k(x)=(x-100)(x+20)\). How would you explain to a friend who is absent today how to use the equation to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Find the zeros of the function? </li>
  <li> Find the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph? </li>
  <li> Find the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex without graphing? </li>
  <li> Find the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex without graphing? </li>
  <li> Find the \(y\)-intercept of the graph? </li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the day’s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
