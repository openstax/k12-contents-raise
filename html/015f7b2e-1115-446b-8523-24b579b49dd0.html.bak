<h4>Real-Life Graphs of Functions</h4>
<p>A ball is bouncing across the school yard. The vertical or \(y\)-axis represents the height of the ball in feet, \(h(t)\), while the horizontal or \(x\)-axis represents the time, \(t\), that has passed in seconds.Â </p>

<p><img alt="Graph that shows the height of a ball in feet as a function of time in seconds with a y-intercepts of 0 and x-intercepts of 0 and 1 from x equals 0 to x equals 1, the height of the ball is modeled by an upside down parabola with a maximum at the point (0.5, 4)." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="293" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/9c26e6224714d52a4570a234fc52d7c5e8f1ed28" width="300"/></p>
<p>On the graph, \(t=0\) represents the first time the ball touches the ground.</p>
<p>What is \(h(1)\), and what does it represent in the context of the problem?</p>
<p>\(h(1) = 0\), and it represents the height of the ball after 1 second, or the ball has a height of zero after 1 second. The value inside of the parentheses is the value from the \(x\)-axis or horizontal axis. The solution is the value of the graph at that point.</p>
<h4>Try It: Real-Life Graphs of Functions</h4>
<p>A ball is thrown across the field from point \(A\) to point \(B\). It hits the ground at point \(B\). The path of the ball is shown in the diagram below. The \(x\)-axis shows the horizontal distance the ball travels in feet, and the \(y\)-axis shows the height of the ball in feet.</p>
