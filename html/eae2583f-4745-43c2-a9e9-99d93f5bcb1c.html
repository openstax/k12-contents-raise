<h4>Lesson Narrative&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Prior to this point, students
  have worked primarily with equations in one and two variables. In this
  lesson, they shift their attention to inequalities. Here and in the next
  two lessons, students interpret, write, and find solutions to
  inequalities in one variable. The activities here are grounded in
  contexts, and the ideas build on the work students have done in grade 7
  (TEKS 7.10).</p>
<p>The focus of this lesson is on
  interpreting and writing inequalities that represent the constraints in
  various situations. As students consider key quantities in a situation,
  select variables to represent them, and decide whether multiple
  inequalities (and which ones) are needed, they engage in aspects of
  mathematical modeling.</p>
<p>In future lessons, students will
  use the insights from this lesson to find and interpret the solutions
  to inequalities that model situations.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Interpret and write inequalities that represent the constraints in a situation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Write inequalities that represent the constraints in a situation.</li>
</ul>
