<h4>Lesson Narrative&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Prior to this point, students
  have worked primarily with equations in one and two variables. In this
  lesson, they shift their attention to inequalities. Here and in the next
  two lessons, students interpret, write, and find solutions to
  inequalities in one variable. The activities here are grounded in
  contexts, and the ideas build on the work students have done in grade 7
  (TEKS 7.10).</p>
<p>The focus of this lesson is on interpreting and writing inequalities that represent the constraints in
  various situations. As students consider key quantities in a situation,
  select variables to represent them, and decide whether multiple
  inequalities (and which ones) are needed, they engage in aspects of
  mathematical modeling.
</p>
<p>In future lessons, students will
  use the insights from this lesson to find and interpret the solutions
  to inequalities that model situations.</p>

<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>
<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Familiarize students with
    the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson. Encourage
    students to look for these words and notice their use and meanings.</li>
  <li>Encourage students to use key vocabulary words in &ldquo;math talk&rdquo; and their written and oral explanations.</li>
  <li>Utilize a word wall. Sample cards are located here: <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/8ed3aa68763498713b44d3c2e537ffe61b4755f0" target="_blank">Mathematics Vocabulary Word Wall Cards</a></li>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners </h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS.  The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines. </p>
<ul>
  <li>ELPS 1(A) use prior knowledge and experiences to understand meanings in English </li>
  <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audio tape, video, DVD, and CD ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(B) expand and internalize initial English vocabulary by learning and using high-frequency English words necessary for identifying and describing people, places, and objects, by retelling simple stories and basic information represented or supported by pictures, and by learning and using routine language needed for classroom communication </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(F) ask and give information ranging from using a very limited bank of high-frequency, high- need, concrete vocabulary, including key words and expressions needed for basic communication in academic and social contexts, to using abstract and content-based vocabulary during extended speaking assignments </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(H) narrate, describe, and explain with increasing specificity and detail as more English is acquired </li>
  <li>ELPS 4(G) demonstrate comprehension of increasingly complex Eng by participating in shared reading, retelling or summarizing material, responding to questions, and taking notes commensurate with content area and grade level needs </li>
  <li>ELPS 5(B) write using newly acquired basic vocabulary and content-based grade-level vocabulary </li>
</ul>
