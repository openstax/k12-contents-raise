<p>In this lesson, you will activate and build on what you have learned about solving by <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">substitution</span>, or replacing a variable with a number or with an expression. Various substitutions can be done to solve the same system. You will also begin to build an awareness of the kinds of systems that are conducive to being solved by substitution.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Solve systems of equations by substituting a variable or an expression.</li>
  <li>Know more than one way to perform a substitution and decide which way or what to substitute based on how the given equations are written.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2.2.1: Finding Connections between Graphs and Equations</li>
  <li>2.2.2: Checking Solutions in Systems<ul>
