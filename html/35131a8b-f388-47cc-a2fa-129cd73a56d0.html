<p dir="ltr">TEA&rsquo;s Inclusion in Texas Learning Abilities describes strategies within seven different categories.&nbsp; Many teaching and learning strategies you integrate into your classroom for students with disabilities will fall into multiple categories. &nbsp; These strategies are also beneficial for all learners to scaffold them to success. &nbsp; Do not be afraid to include in your resources for all students.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Thinking &amp; Reasoning (TR)</strong> uses deliberate and controlled procedures (often requiring focused attention) to solve novel, on-the-spot problems that cannot be solved using previously learned habits, schemas, and scripts. (McGrew and Schneider, 2018) </li>
  <li> <strong>Processing Speed (PS)</strong> is the ability to control attention automatically, quickly, and fluently perform simple, repetitive cognitive tasks. (McGrew and Schneider, 2018) </li>
  <li> <strong>Efficiency of Learning (EoL)</strong> is the ability to learn, store, and consolidate new information over periods of time measured in minutes, hours, days, and years. (McGrew and Schneider, 2018) </li>
  <li> <strong>Retrieval of Information (RoI)</strong> is the rate and fluency at which individuals can access information stored in long-term memory. (McGrew and Schneider 2018) </li>
  <li> <strong>Working Memory (WM)</strong> is the ability to maintain and manipulate information in active attention. The mind's mental &quot;scratchpad&quot; or &ldquo;workbench.&rdquo; (McGrew and Schneider 2018) </li>
  <li> <strong>Vocabulary Knowledge (VK)</strong> is directly related to background knowledge. Vocabulary knowledge includes knowledge of the definitions of words and the concepts that underlie them. (McGrew and Schneider 2018) </li>
  <li> <strong>Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR)</strong> is the ability to use simulated mental imagery (often in conjunction with currently perceived images) to solve problems. (McGrew and Schneider 2018) </li>
</ul>
