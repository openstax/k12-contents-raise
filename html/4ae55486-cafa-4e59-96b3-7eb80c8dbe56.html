<h4>Cool Down Activity</h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A band is playing at an auditorium with floor seats and balcony seats. The band wants to sell the floor tickets for $15 each and balcony tickets for $12 each. They want to make at least $3,000 in ticket sales.</span><br></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>&nbsp;<span>How much money will they collect for selling x floor tickets?</span></li>
  <li>How much money will they collect for selling y balcony tickets?</li>
  <li>Write an inequality whose solutions are the number of floor and balcony tickets sold if they make at least $3,000 in ticket sales.</li>
  <li>Use technology to graph the solutions to your inequality, and sketch the graph.</li>
