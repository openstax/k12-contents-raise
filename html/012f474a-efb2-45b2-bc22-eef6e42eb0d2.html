<p>Invite students to summarize their understanding so far of what a quadratic expression (or relationship) is and is not. Discuss questions such as:</p>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;In what ways is the relationship between the step number and the number of small squares different from linear functions we&rsquo;ve seen so far?&rdquo; (When one quantity increases by a certain amount, the other quantity does not change by the same amount. The graph relating the two quantities is not a straight line. The rule that relates the two quantities is different from a linear expression.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;In what ways is the relationship between the two quantities different from the exponential functions we&rsquo;ve encountered?&rdquo; (When the input increases by an amount, the output does not always change by the same factor. The graph representing this relationship is a curve, but it is different from the graph of an exponential function. Even though there may be an exponent in the expression (for example, \(n^2\)), the rule that relates the two quantities is not like exponential expressions we&rsquo;ve seen, where the input was the exponent.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;How would you describe &lsquo;quadratic relationship&rsquo; to someone who is unfamiliar with it?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
