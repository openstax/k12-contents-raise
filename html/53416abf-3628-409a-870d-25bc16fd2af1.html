<p dir="ltr">Farms To Grow founders Gordon Reed and Gail Myers work with Black farmers and other underserved farmers to help them keep their farms operational. Statistical models can help the farmers they work with make decisions about how to sustain their farm. They can use statistics to decide the best way to package and ship their products. They can use statistics relating to the best types of soil to use and how it affects their crop.</p>

The section closes with an exploration of the difference between correlation and causal relationships.</p>
