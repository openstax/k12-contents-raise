<h4>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h4>
  <p>In this warm-up, students review how to apply the distributive property to rewrite expressions that involve
    division, preparing them to do so in the next activity in the lesson.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
  <p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Give students a moment of quiet time to work on the first two questions and then
    time to discuss their responses with their partner before moving on the last two questions.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
  <p>Rewrite each quotient as a sum or a difference. </p>
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li> \( \dfrac {4x-10}{2} \)<br><strong>Answer:</strong>  \( 2x - 5 \)</li> 
      <li> \( \dfrac {1 - 50x}{-2} \)<br><strong>Answer:</strong>  \( - \frac12 + 25x \)  </li>
        <li> \( \dfrac {5(x+10)}{25} \)<br><strong>Answer:</strong>  \( \frac15 x + 2 \) </li>
          <li> \( \dfrac {- \frac15 x + 5}{2} \)<br><strong>Answer:</strong> \( - \frac {1}{10}x + \frac52 \)   </li>
 </ol>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
  <p>Expect some students to give  \( 2x-10 \)  or  \( 4x-5 \)  as an answer to the first question. To illustrate why these are
    incorrect, take an example like  \( \frac{4+6}{2} \) . Explain that we know
    that 10 divided by 2 is 5, but if we divide only the 4 or only the 6 by 2, we won&rsquo;t get 5. Alternatively,
    remind students that fraction bars can be interpreted as division, so each expression can be rewritten as, say,
     \( (4x-10) \div 2 \) , and we can apply the distributive property.</p>
  <p>The signs of the numbers in the second expression might be a source of confusion. Students might be unsure if the
    expression should be  \( - \frac12 -25x \) ,  \( \frac12 + 25x \) , or another expression. Encourage students to substitute a
    number into the original expression and then try it in each potential answer. To explain why  \( - \frac12 + 25x \)  is correct, appeal to the distributive property again.</p>
 
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
 
  <p>Invite students to share their equivalent expressions and how they reasoned about them. Display their expressions
    for all to see. Make sure students see that rewriting the expressions as sums or differences involves distributing
    the division (or applying the distributive property of division). </p>
  <p>If not mentioned in students&rsquo; explanations, point out each division could be thought of in terms of
    multiplication. For example,  \( \frac {4x-10}{2} \)  is equivalent to  \( \frac12 (4x-10) \) because dividing by a number (in this case, 2) gives
    the same result as multiplying by the reciprocal of that number (in this case,  \(
      \frac12 \) ). Applying the distributive property of multiplication to  \(
      \frac12 (4x-10) \)  enables us to rewrite this product as a difference.</p>
