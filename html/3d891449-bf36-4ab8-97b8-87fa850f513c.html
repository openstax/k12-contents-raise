<h4>Activity (20 minutes)
</h4>
<p>This activity encourages students to write an equation in two variables to represent a constraint and then solve for
  each of the variables. One motivation for rearranging the equation is to find an expression that, when entered into a
  calculator or computer, can be used to quickly find the value of one quantity given the value of the other.</p>
<p>As they use spreadsheet technology to create mathematical models, test them, and solve problems, students engage in
  aspects of mathematical modeling.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 3&ndash;4 and provide access to devices with spreadsheet or graphing technology.</p>
<p>Give students a few minutes of quiet time to think about the first question and then time to discuss their responses
  with their group. Ask students to pause for a class discussion, and ensure everyone is using a correct equation before
  proceeding.</p>
<p>Once students have responses for the second question, invite them to share how they found the number of cars that can
  be shipped if the cargo already has some number of trucks. Next, ask for the expressions they wrote to find the number
  of cars that can fit if there are \( t \) trucks. Record the expressions for all to see.</p>
<p>Tell students that we can test the expressions by using a calculator or computer. Consider demonstrating how to use
  technology to calculate the number of cars given the number of trucks. You may need to prepare alternate instructions
  if using different technology in the classroom.</p>
<p>Tell students that their job in the last three questions is to find the number of trucks when the number of cars is
  known. Encourage them to test their equations using available technology.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>An automobile manufacturer is preparing a shipment of cars and trucks on a cargo ship that can carry 21,600 tons.</p>
<p>The cars weigh 3.6 tons each, and the trucks weigh 7.5 tons each.</p>

<h3>Student Facing Extension</h3>
<h4>Are you ready for more?</h4>
<p>For numbers 1 and 2, use the following situation:<br>For yet another shipment, the manufacturer is also shipping motorcycles, which weigh 0.3 ton each.</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Write an equation that you could enter into a calculator or a spreadsheet tool to find the number of motorcycles
    that can be shipped, \( m \), if the number of cars and trucks are known.
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( m=\dfrac{21,\!600-7.5t - 3.6c}{0.3} \)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Use your equation to find the number of motorcycles that can be shipped if the cargo already contains 1,200 trucks
    and 3,000 cars.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 6000</p>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>When finding the number of cars, \( c \), given \( t \) trucks, students may have arrived at the expression \( \dfrac
  {21,600 - 7.5t}{3.6} \) by generalizing the calculation they performed when the number of trucks was a numerical
  value. Likewise, in the last question they may have arrived at \( t = \dfrac{21,600 - 3.6c}{7.5} \) by using some
  numerical values for \( c \) and generalizing the process.</p>
<p>While this strategy is expected and perfectly reasonable, make sure students also see that we can arrive at the same
  expression for \( c \) and for \( t \) by rearranging the equation \( 3.6c + 7.5t = 21,\!600 \).</p>
<p>Highlight that we can solve for \( c \) when we know the number of trucks and want to compute the number of cars, and
  we can solve for \( t \) when we know the number of cars and want to find the number of trucks.</p>
<p>\( \begin {align} 3.6c + 7.5t &amp;= 21,\!600\\ 3.6c &amp;= 21,\!600 - 7.5t\\ c&amp;=\dfrac {21,\!600 - 7.5t}{3.6}
  \end{align} \)</p>
<p>\( \begin {align} 3.6c + 7.5t &amp;= 21,\!600\\ 7.5t &amp;= 21,\!600 - 3.6c\\ t &amp;=\dfrac {21,\!600 - 3.6c}{7.5}
  \end{align} \)</p>
