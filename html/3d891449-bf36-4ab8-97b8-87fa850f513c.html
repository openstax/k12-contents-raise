<div class="activities"><h4>Activity (20 minutes)
            
            </h4><div class="body">
<p>This activity encourages students to write an equation in two variables to represent a constraint and then solve for each of the variables. One motivation for rearranging the equation is to find an expression that, when entered into a calculator or computer, can be used to quickly find the value of one quantity given the value of the other.</p>
<p>As they use spreadsheet technology to create mathematical models, test them, and solve problems, students engage in aspects of mathematical modeling (MP4).</p>
</div>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<div class="body">
<p>Arrange students in groups of 3&ndash;4 and provide access to devices with spreadsheet or graphing technology.</p>
<p>Give students a few minutes of quiet time to think about the first question and then time to discuss their responses with their group. Ask students to pause for a class discussion, and ensure everyone is using a correct equation before proceeding.</p>
<p>Once students have responses for the second question, invite them to share how they found the number of cars that can be shipped if the cargo already has some number of trucks. Next, ask for the expressions they wrote to find the number of cars that can fit if there are <span class="math math-repaired">\( t \)</span> trucks. Record the expressions for all to see.</p>
<p>Tell students that we can test the expressions by using a calculator or computer. Consider demonstrating how to use technology to calculate the number of cars given the number of trucks. You may need to prepare alternate instructions if using different technology in the classroom.</p>
<p>Tell students that their job in the last question is to find the number of trucks when the number of cars is known. Encourage them to test their equations using available technology.</p>

<p>For one shipment, trucks are loaded first and cars are loaded afterward. (Even though trucks are bulkier than cars, a shipment can consist of all trucks as long as it is within the weight limit.)</p>

<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<div class="body">
<p>When finding the number of cars, <span class="math math-repaired">\( c \)</span>, given <span class="math math-repaired">\( t \)</span> trucks, students may have arrived at the expression <span class="math math-repaired">\( \dfrac {21,600 - 7.5t}{3.6} \)</span> by generalizing the calculation they performed when the number of trucks was a numerical value. Likewise, in the last question they may have arrived at <span class="math math-repaired">\( t = \dfrac{21,600 - 3.6c}{7.5} \)</span> by using some numerical values for <span class="math math-repaired">\( c \)</span> and generalizing the process.</p>
<p>While this strategy is expected and perfectly reasonable, make sure students also see that we can arrive at the same expression for <span class="math math-repaired">\( c \)</span> and for <span class="math math-repaired">\( t \)</span> by rearranging the equation <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3.6c + 7.5t = 21,\!600 \)</span>.</p>
<p>Highlight that we can solve for <span class="math math-repaired">\( c \)</span> when we know the number of trucks and want to compute the number of cars, and we can solve for <span class="math math-repaired">\( t \)</span> when we know the number of cars and want to find the number of trucks.</p>
