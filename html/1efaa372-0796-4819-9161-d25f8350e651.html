<h3> Activity (15 minutes) </h3>

<p>In this activity, students solve problems involving two quantities in non-proportional linear relationships. As
  before, they are prompted to reason repeatedly about the value of one quantity given the other and to generalize the
  process by writing an expression. They then connect the work here to the idea of writing an equation and isolating a
  variable of interest.</p>
<p>As students work, monitor for the different ways students reason about the unknown number of minutes in the second
  question (for Tank A) and the last question (for Tank B). Some students may find the missing value by reasoning about
  the quantities informally. Others may write an equation and reason about the equation or solve the equation for a
  variable.</p>
<p>For example, to find the number of minutes that have passed when Tank B has 18 liters left, students may:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reason that the tank has lost 62 liters because \( 80-62=18 \) or \( 80-18=62 \) . If each minute it loses 2.5
    liters, then it would take \( \frac{62}{2.5} \) or 24.8 minutes for it to lose 62 liters.</li>
  <li>Write \( 80 - 2.5t = 18 \) and think: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for a number that, when multiplied by 2.5 and
    subtracted from 80, gives 18,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for a number that, when multiplied by 2.5, is equal
    to \( 80-18 \) .&rdquo;</li>
  <li>
    <p>Write \( 80 - 2.5t = 75 \) and solve for \( t \) this way:</p>
    <p> \( \begin {align} 80-2.5t &amp;=18\\ -2.5t &amp;= 18 - 80\\t &amp;= \frac{18-80}{-2.5} \\t &amp;=
      \frac{-62}{-2.5} \\ t&amp;=\frac{62}{2.5}\\ t&amp;=24.8 \end{align} \) </p>
    <p>Or this way:</p>
    <p> \( \begin {align} 80-2.5t &amp;=18\\80-18-2.5t &amp;= 0\\80-18 &amp;= 2.5t \\\frac{80-18}{2.5}&amp;= t \\
      \frac{62}{2.5} &amp;=t\\24.8 &amp;=t \end{align} \) </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of the approach students take, the important idea to spotlight (for Tank B) is that finding the time at
  which the water in the tank reaches a certain volume can be done by subtracting that volume ( \( v \) ) from the
  original volume (80 liters) and then dividing it by 2.5. That process can be summarized by the expression: \(
  \dfrac{80-v}{2.5} \) .</p>
<p>If we start out with the equation \( 80-2.5t = v \) and perform allowable moves to isolate \( t \) , we will end up
  with \( t=\dfrac{80-v}{2.5} \) .</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Keep students in groups of 2 and provide continued access to calculators. </p>
<p>If time is limited, consider asking one half of the class to answer the first two questions about Tank A and the
  other half to answer the last two questions about Tank B.</p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their expressions for the last part of each question. Then, focus the discussion on how the
  different strategies students used to answer the other parts of each question could be summed up by the expression, as
  shown in the example in the Activity Narrative above.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their expressions for the last part of each question. Then, focus the discussion on how the
  different strategies students used to answer the other parts of each question could be summed up by the expression, as
  shown in the example in the Activity Narrative. </p>
<p>Discuss questions such as: </p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;How do you know that the expression gives us the liters of water in Tank A after \( m \) minutes?&rdquo;
    (When finding the liters of water in the tank after 4 minutes and 80 seconds, we multiplied the minutes by 9 and
    then added it to 124. So for \( m \) minutes, we&rsquo;d multiply \( m \) by 9 and add 124.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How do you know that the expression gives us the minutes at which the tank reaches \( p \) liters?&rdquo;
    (When finding the minutes at which the tank reaches 151 liters, 191.5 liters, and 270.25 liters, we subtracted 124
    from each number and then divided the difference by 9. So we can do the same for \( p \) liters.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If no students mentioned that they found the expression for the last part of the second and last questions by writing
  an equation and solving it for the variable of interest, demonstrate it for all to see.</p>
<p>For example, in Tank A, we know the relationship between the liters of water in the tank, \( p \) , after \( m \)
  minutes is: \( 124+9m=p \) . To find the minutes at which the tank reaches \( p \) liters, we can isolate \( m \) :
</p>
<p> \( \begin{align}124+9m&amp;=p\\9m &amp;=p-124\\ m&amp;=\dfrac{p-124}{9}\end{align} \) </p>

<h4>1.8.3: Additional Resources</h4>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold"><em>The following content is available to students who would like more support based on
    their experience with the self check. Students will not automatically have access to this content, so you may wish
    to share it with those who could benefit from it.</em></p>
<h4>Choosing Which Equation to Use</h4>
<p>A relationship between quantities
  can be described in more than one way. Some ways are more helpful than
  others, depending on what we want to find out. Let&rsquo;s look at the angles
  of an isosceles triangle, for example.</p>
  <div class="os-raise-d-flex os-raise-justify-content-between">
  <img
    src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4dd78e58c323915d1b1394785533170a4ef8149b"
    alt="Triangle with angles labeled a, b, and a." />

  <p>The two angles near the horizontal side<br> have equal measurement in degrees, \(a\).<br><br>
The sum of angles in a triangle is<br> \(180\circ\) , so the relationship between<br> the angles can be expressed as:<br><br>
    \(a+a+b=180\)
  </p>

</div>  
 
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Suppose we want to find \(a\) when \(b\) is \(20^\circ\).</p>
<p>\( a+a+b=180 \)<br>\( 2a+20=180 \)<br>\( 2a=180-20 \)<br>\( 2a=160 \)</p>
<p>\( a=80 \)</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>What is the value of \(b\) if \(a\) is \(72.5^\circ\)?</p>
<p>\( a+a+b=180 \)<br>\( 72.5+72.5+b=80 \)<br>\( 145+b=180 \)<br>\( b=35 \)</p>

<p>Notice that when \(b\) is given, we did the same calculation repeatedly to find \(a\): We substituted \(b\) into the
  first equation, subtracted \(b\) from 180, and then divided the result by 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of taking these steps over and over whenever we know \( b \)
  and want to find \( a \), we can rearrange the equation to isolate
  \( a \):</p>
<p>\( a+a+b=180 \)<br>\( 2a+b=180 \)<br>\( 2a=180-b \)<br>\( a=\frac{180-b}{2} \)<br>\( a=90-\frac{1}{2}b \)</p>
<p>This equation is equivalent to the first one. To find \( a \), we can
  now simply substitute any value of \( b \) into this equation and
  evaluate the expression on the right side.</p>
<p>Likewise, we can write an equivalent equation to make it easier to find \( b \) when we know \( a \):</p>
<p>\( a+a+b=180 \)<br>\( 2a+b=180 \)<br>\( b=180-2a \)</p>
<p>Rearranging an equation to isolate one variable is called solving for
  a variable. In this example, we have solved for \( a \) and for
  \( b \). All three equations are equivalent. Depending on what
  information we have and what we are interested in, we can choose a
  particular equation to use.</p>
<p>Rewrite the equation \(a+a+b=180\) as an equivalent equation that could be used to easily find \(b\).</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(b=180-2a\).</p>
<h4>Try It: Choosing Which Equation to Use</h4>
<p>Jake and Bryce are saving their allowance. Jake saved for one week, and Bryce saved for 2 weeks. Together they saved
  $15. Write an equation
  to find Bryce&rsquo;s allowance.</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p>Here is how to write an equation to find Bryce&rsquo;s allowance.</p>
<p>Let \( j \): Jake&rsquo;s allowance and \( b \): Bryce&rsquo;s allowance.</p>
<p>\( j + 2b = 15 \)</p>
<p>Solve for \( b \) to find Bryce&rsquo;s allowance.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Subtract \(j\) from each side. <br>
  \(j−j+2b=15−j\) </p>
  <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Simplify. <br>
  \(2b=15−j\) </p>
  <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Divide both sides by 2. <br>
  \(\frac{2b}{2}=\frac{15-j}{2}\)</p>
<br>
<p>So to find Bryce&rsquo;s allowance, use the equation: \( b=\frac{15-j}{2} \) or \( b=\frac{15}{2}-\frac{j}{2} \).</p>
