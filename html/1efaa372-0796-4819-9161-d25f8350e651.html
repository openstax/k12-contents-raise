      <h4><span>Activity (15 minutes)</span></h4>
      <div class="body">
        <p>In this activity, students solve problems involving two quantities in non-proportional linear relationships. As before, they are prompted to reason repeatedly about the value of one quantity given the other and to generalize the process by writing an expression. They then connect the work here to the idea of writing an equation and isolating a variable of interest.</p>
        <p>As students work, monitor for the different ways students reason about the unknown number of minutes in the second question (for Tank A) and the last question (for Tank B). Some students may find the missing value by reasoning about the quantities informally. Others may write an equation and reason about the equation or solve the equation for a variable.</p>
        <p>For example, to find the number of minutes that have passed when Tank B has 18 liters left, students may:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reason that the tank has lost 62 liters because <span class="math math-repaired">\( 80-62=18 \)</span> or <span class="math math-repaired">\( 80-18=62 \)</span>. If each minute it loses 2.5 liters, then it would take <span class="math math-repaired">\( \frac{62}{2.5} \)</span> or 24.8 minutes for it to lose 62 liters.</li>
          <li>Write <span class="math math-repaired">\( 80 - 2.5t = 18 \)</span> and think: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for a number that, when multiplied by 2.5 and subtracted from 80, gives 18,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for a number that, when multiplied by 2.5, is equal to <span class="math math-repaired">\( 80-18 \)</span>.&rdquo;</li>
          <li>
            <p>Write <span class="math math-repaired">\( 80 - 2.5t = 75 \)</span> and solve for <span class="math math-repaired">\( t \)</span> this way:</p>
            <div class="imgrid">
              <div class="g--row g--row-1">
                <div class="g--col-1 g--column g--content g--half g--row-1">
                  <p><span class="math math-repaired">\( \begin {align} 80-2.5t &amp;=18\\ -2.5t &amp;= 18 - 80\\t &amp;= \frac{18-80}{-2.5} \\t &amp;= \frac{-62}{-2.5} \\ t&amp;=\frac{62}{2.5}\\ t&amp;=24.8 \end{align} \)</span></p>
                </div>
                <div class="g--col-2 g--column g--content g--half g--row-1">
                  <p>Or this way:</p>
                  <p><span class="math">\( \begin {align} 80-2.5t &amp;=18\\80-18-2.5t &amp;= 0\\80-18 &amp;= 2.5t \\\frac{80-18}{2.5}&amp;= t \\ \frac{62}{2.5} &amp;=t\\24.8 &amp;=t \end{align} \)</span></p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Regardless of the approach students take, the important idea to spotlight (for Tank B) is that finding the time at which the water in the tank reaches a certain volume can be done by subtracting that volume (<span class="math math-repaired">\( v \)</span>) from the original volume (80 liters) and then dividing it by 2.5. That process can be summarized by the expression: <span class="math math-repaired">\( \dfrac{80-v}{2.5} \)</span>.</p>
        <p>If we start out with the equation <span class="math math-repaired">\( 80-2.5t = v \)</span> and perform allowable moves to isolate <span class="math math-repaired">\( t \)</span>, we will end up with <span class="math math-repaired">\( t=\dfrac{80-v}{2.5} \)</span>.</p>

        <p>For students who struggle to write expressions for <span class="math math-repaired">\( p \)</span> liters and <span class="math math-repaired">\( v \)</span> liters, encourage them to revisit their previous three calculations.

      </div>
      <h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>Invite students to share their expressions for the last part of each question. Then, focus the discussion on how the different strategies students used to answer the other parts of each question could be summed up by the expression, as shown in the example in the Activity Narrative. </p>
        <p>Discuss questions such as: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>&ldquo;How do you know that the expression gives us the liters of water in Tank A after <span class="math math-repaired">\( m \)</span> minutes?&rdquo; (When finding the liters of water in the tank after 4 minutes and 80 seconds, we multiplied the minutes by 9 and then added it to 124. So for <span class="math math-repaired">\( m \)</span> minutes, we&rsquo;d multiply <span class="math math-repaired">\( m \)</span> by 9 and add 124.)</li>
          <li>&ldquo;How do you know that the expression gives us the minutes at which the tank reaches <span class="math">\( p \)</span> liters?&rdquo; (When finding the minutes at which the tank reaches 151 liters, 191.5 liters, and 270.25 liters, we subtracted 124 from each number and then divided the difference by 9. So we can do the same for <span class="math math-repaired">\( p \)</span> liters.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If no students mentioned that they found the expression for the last part of the second and last questions by writing an equation and solving it for the variable of interest, demonstrate it for all to see.</p>
        <p>For example, in Tank A, we know the relationship between the liters of water in the tank, <span class="math math-repaired">\( p \)</span>, after <span class="math math-repaired">\( m \)</span> minutes is: <span class="math math-repaired">\( 124+9m=p \)</span>. To find the minutes at which the tank reaches <span class="math">\( p \)</span> liters, we can isolate <span class="math math-repaired">\( m \)</span>:</p>
        <p><span class="math">\( \begin{align}124+9m&amp;=p\\9m &amp;=p-124\\ m&amp;=\dfrac{p-124}{9}\end{align} \)</span></p>

              <h4>Choosing Which Equation to Use</h4>
              <p>A relationship between quantities
                can be described in more than one way. Some ways are more helpful than
                others, depending on what we want to find out. Let&rsquo;s look at the angles
                of an isosceles triangle, for example.</p>
              <p><img alt="Triangle with angles labeled a, b, and a." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="188" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4dd78e58c323915d1b1394785533170a4ef8149b" width="348"><br></p>
              <p>The two angles near the horizontal side have equal measurement in degrees, \(&nbsp;a&nbsp;\).</p>
              <p>The sum of angles in a triangle is \(180&deg;\), so the relationship between the angles can be expressed as:</p>
              <p>\( a+a+b=180 \)<br></p>
              <p>Suppose we want to find \(a\) when \(&nbsp;b&nbsp;\) is \(20&deg;\).</p>
              <p>Let&rsquo;s substitute 20 for \(&nbsp;b&nbsp;\) and solve the equation.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>\(&nbsp;a+a+b=180&nbsp;\)<br>\(&nbsp;2a+20=180&nbsp;\)<br>\(&nbsp;2a=180-20&nbsp;\)<br>\(&nbsp;2a=160&nbsp;\)</p>
              <p>\(&nbsp;a=80&nbsp;\)</p>
              <p>What is the value of \(&nbsp;b&nbsp;\) if \(a\) is \(72.5&deg;\)?</p>
              <p>\(&nbsp;a+a+b=180&nbsp;\)<br>\(&nbsp;72.5+72.5+b=80&nbsp;\)<br>\(&nbsp;145+b=180&nbsp;\)<br>\(&nbsp;b=35&nbsp;\)</p>
              <p>Notice that when \(&nbsp;b&nbsp;\) is given, we did the same calculation
                repeatedly to find \(&nbsp;a\): we substituted \(b\) into the first equation,
                subtracted \(&nbsp;b \) from 180, and then divided the result by 2.</p>
              <p>Instead of taking these steps over and over whenever we know \(&nbsp;b&nbsp;\)
                and want to find \(&nbsp;a&nbsp;\), we can rearrange the equation to isolate
                \(&nbsp;a&nbsp;\):</p>
              <p>\(&nbsp;a+a+b=180&nbsp;\)<br>\(&nbsp;2a+b=180&nbsp;\)<br>\(&nbsp;2a=180-b&nbsp;\)<br>\(&nbsp;a=\frac{180-b}{2}&nbsp;\)<br>\(&nbsp;a=90-\frac{1}{2}b&nbsp;\)</p>
              <p>This equation is equivalent to the first one. To find \(&nbsp;a&nbsp;\), we can
                now simply substitute any value of \(&nbsp;b&nbsp;\) into this equation and
                evaluate the expression on the right side.</p>
              <p>Likewise, we can write an equivalent equation to make it easier to find \(&nbsp;b&nbsp;\) when we know \(&nbsp;a&nbsp;\):</p>
              <p>\(&nbsp;a+a+b=180&nbsp;\)<br>\(&nbsp;2a+b=180&nbsp;\)<br>\(&nbsp;b=180-2a&nbsp;\)</p>
              <p>Rearranging an equation to isolate one variable is called solving for
                a variable. In this example, we have solved for \(&nbsp;a&nbsp;\) and for
                \(&nbsp;b&nbsp;\). All three equations are equivalent. Depending on what
                information we have and what we are interested in, we can choose a
                particular equation to use.</p>
