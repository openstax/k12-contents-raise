<h4>Arithmetic Sequences</h4>
<p><strong>Finding Common Differences</strong></p>
<p>Companies often make large purchases, such as computers and vehicles, for business use.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A woman who starts a small contracting business purchases a new truck for $25,000.
  </li>
  <li>
    After five years, she estimates that she will be able to sell the truck for $8,000. The loss in value of the truck will therefore be $17,000, which is $3,400 per year for five years.
  </li>
  <li>
    The truck will be worth $21,600 after the first year; $18,200 after two years; $14,800 after three years; $11,400 after four years; and $8,000 at the end of five years.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The values of the truck in the example are said to form an arithmetic sequence because they change by a constant amount each year. Each term increases or decreases by the same constant value called the common difference of the sequence. For this sequence, the common difference is &ndash;3,400.</p>

<p>The sequence below is another example of an arithmetic sequence. In this case, the common difference is 3. You can choose any term of the sequence and add 3 to find the subsequent term.</p>

<p><strong>ARITHMETIC SEQUENCE</strong></p>
<p>An arithmetic sequence is a sequence that has the property that the difference between any two consecutive terms is a constant. This constant is called the common difference. If \(a_1\) is the first term of an arithmetic sequence and \(d\) is the common difference, the sequence will be:</p>
<p>{\(a_n\)}={\(a_1, a_1+d, a_1+2d, a_1+3d\), . . .}</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Is each sequence arithmetic? If so, find the common difference.</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>
    {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, . . .}
  </li>
  <li>
    (&ndash;3, 1, 5, 9, 13, . . .}
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Subtract each term from the subsequent term to determine whether a common difference exists.</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>
    The sequence is not arithmetic because there is no common difference.
  </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>\(2-1=1\)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\(4-2=2\)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\(8-4=4\)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\(16-8=8\)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2" type="a">
  <li>
    The sequence is arithmetic because there is a common difference. The common difference is 4.
  </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>\(1-(-3)=4\)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\(5-1=4\)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\(9-5=4\)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\(13-9=4\)
  </p>
