<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Activity&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Translate to a system of equations and then solve:</p>
<p>When Jenna spent 10 minutes on the elliptical trainer and then lifted weights for 20 minutes, her fitness app said she burned 278 calories. When she spent 20 minutes on the elliptical trainer and 30 minutes lifting weights she burned 473 calories. How many calories does she burn for each minute on the elliptical trainer? How many calories does she burn for each minute of lifting weights?</p>
<p>Let \(x =\) calories burned per minute on the elliptical and \(y=\) calories burned per minute lifting weights.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Answers may vary. Here is a sample response.</p>
<p>\((11,8.5)\)</p>
<p>The elliptical burns about 11 calories per minute. Lifting weights burns about 8.5 calories per minute.</p>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
