<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students recall that an area diagram can be used to illustrate multiplication of a number and a sum. This work prepares them to use diagrams to reason about the product of two sums that are variable expressions.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Give students quiet work time and then time to share their work with a partner.</p>

<ol>
<li>Explain why the diagram shows that \(6(3+4)=6 \cdot 3+6 \cdot 4\).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The entire diagram represents the product \(6(3+4)\). The upper half represents \(6 \cdot 3\) while the lower half represents \(6 \cdot 4\).</li>

<li>Draw a diagram to show that \(5(x + 2) = 5x + 10\).</li>

<p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong> Diagrams will vary, but should show a large rectangle with two sub-rectangles, with one sub-rectangle representing \(5 \cdot x\), and the other representing \(5 \cdot 2\). For example:</p>
<p><img alt="A RECTANGLE DIVIDED INTO TWO SMALLER RECTANGLES. THE LENGTH OF THE RECTANGLE IS 5, THE WIDTH OF ONE SMALLER RECTANGLE IS X, AND THE WIDTH OF THE OTHER SMALLER RECTANGLE IS 2." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="221" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/fd20ae615b762081a23167872994173f39721d7d" width="240"></p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Make sure students understand that the expressions \(6 \cdot 3+6 \cdot 4\) and \(6(3+4)\) are two ways of representing the area of the same rectangle.</p>
<ul>
<li> One expression treats the area of the largest rectangle as a sum of the areas of the two smaller rectangles that are 6 by 3 and 6 by 4. </li>
<li> The other expression describes the area of the largest rectangle as a product of its two side lengths, which are 6 and the sum of 3 and 4. </li>
</ul>
<p>We can reason about \(5(x+2)\) and \(5x+10\) the same way. \(5(x+2)\) can represent the area of a large rectangle that is 5 by \(x+2\), and \(5x+10\) can represent the area of a large rectangle composed of two smaller ones whose areas are \(5x\) and \(5 \cdot 2\) or 10. When we express \(5(x+2)\) as \(5x+10\), we are applying the distributive property.</p>
