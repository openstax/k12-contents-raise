In this unit, they extend those ideas and skills to solve systems of linear equations, linear inequalities, and systems of linear inequalities.</span></p>

Additionally, students reinforce their awareness that a system of equations could have one solution, no solutions, or infinitely many solutions.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-8b41cf35-7fff-3b51-e188-e1d253c33c70">In the last part of the unit, students rely on their understanding of equations to explore inequalities in one and two variables. They see that inequalities are a handy way to express constraints that involve an upper or lower limit, and can be satisfied by a range of values rather than a single value. (For instance, if the weekly work hours, h, of an employee must be at least 40 or h &ge; 40, any value that is 40 or greater meets this constraint.)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-8b41cf35-7fff-3b51-e188-e1d253c33c70">Students see that a solution to an inequality (in one or two variables) is a value or a pair of values that makes the inequality true, and a solution to a system of inequalities in two variables is any pair of values that make both inequalities in the system true. The solution set of a system of inequalities, they learn, can be best represented by graphing.&nbsp;</span></p><br><br>
