<p>In the previous unit, students began working with linear equations and their graphs. In this unit, they extend those ideas and skills to solve systems of linear equations, linear inequalities, and systems of linear inequalities.</p>
<p>They learn to solve systems of equations by elimination, to explain why the steps taken to eliminate a variable are valid and productive, and to articulate how the process essentially entails writing a series of equivalent systems. Additionally, students reinforce their awareness that a system of equations could have one solution, no solutions, or infinitely many solutions.</p>
<p>In the last part of the unit, students rely on their understanding of equations to explore inequalities in one and two variables. They see that inequalities are a handy way to express constraints that involve an upper or lower limit, and can be satisfied by a range of values rather than a single value. (For instance, if the weekly work hours, h, of an employee must be at least 40 or h &ge; 40, any value that is 40 or greater meets this constraint.)</p>
<p>Students see that a solution to an inequality (in one or two variables) is a value or a pair of values that makes the inequality true, and a solution to a system of inequalities in two variables is any pair of values that make both inequalities in the system true. The solution set of a system of inequalities, they learn, can be best represented by graphing.&nbsp;</p>
