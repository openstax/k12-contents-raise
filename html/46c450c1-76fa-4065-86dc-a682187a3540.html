<h4>Cool Down Activity</h4>
<p>For questions 1â€“3, use the following scenario to write inequalities and to identify solutions.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Here is another riddle:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The sum of two numbers is less than 2.</li>
    <li>If we subtract the second number from the first, the difference is greater than 1.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>What are the two numbers?</p>

      <ul>
         <li>(1.5, 0). The sum is 1.5, which is less than 2. The difference is 1.5, which is greater than 1. The point (1.5, 0) is located in the region where the two shaded regions overlap, which means it is a solution to both inequalities in the system.</li>
         <li>(2, -1). The sum is 1, which is less than 2. The difference is 3, which is greater than 1. The point&nbsp; (2, -1) is located in the region where the two shaded regions overlap, which means it is a solution to both inequalities in the system.</li>
