<p>Here is another riddle:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sum of two numbers is less than 2.</li>
<li>If we subtract the second number from the first, the difference is greater than 1.</li>
</ul>

<li>The region with solid blue shading represents the first clue. The region with line shading represents the second clue.</li>
<li>For example: \((1.5,0)\). The sum is 1.5, which is less than 2. The difference is 1.5, which is greater than 1. The point \((1.5,0)\) is located in the region where the two shaded regions overlap, which means it is a solution to both inequalities in the system.<br><br></li>
