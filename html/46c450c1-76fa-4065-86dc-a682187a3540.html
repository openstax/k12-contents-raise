<p>Here is another riddle:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>The sum of two numbers is less than 2.</li>
<li>If we subtract the second number from the first, the difference is greater than 1.</li>
</ul>

<div class="os-raise-ib-input-content">
<p>What are the two numbers?</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>The riddle can be represented by a system of inequalities. Write an inequality for each statement.</li>
<li>These graphs represent the inequalities in the system.</li>

<p></p><span>Your answers may vary, but here are some sample responses to compare your answers.<br></span>
<br>
<ol>
<li><span>\(\left\{\begin{array}{l}x+y&lt;2\\x-y&gt;1\end{array}\right.\)&nbsp;</span></li>
<li>The region with solid blue shading represents the first clue. The region with line shading represents the second clue.</li>
<li>Sample response: \((1.5,0)\). The sum is 1.5, which is less than 2. The difference is 1.5, which is greater than 1. The point \((1.5,0)\) is located in the region where the two shaded regions overlap, which means it is a solution to both inequalities in the system.<br><br></li>
