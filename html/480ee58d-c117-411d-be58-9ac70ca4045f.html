<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this culminating project, students use their knowledge of quadratic equations in different forms to solve problems.</p>
<p>In the first activity, students are given a graph of a quadratic function and are asked to write the function in factored form. Students will determine how many solutions a function has based on an understanding of its factored form. They will also be able to explain the characteristics of the graph of a quadratic function with no solution.</p>
<p>In the second activity, students work in pairs to fluently rewrite quadratic expressions in factored and standard form using the strategies learned in the unit.</p>
<p>In the third activity, students find the specific equation in standard form of a quadratic function that has certain zeros and passes through a particular point, given a real-world situation. They will use the equation to make a prediction about the situation, given the context of the problem.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> Explain why quadratic equations can have no solutions and explain why there are none. </li>
<li> Recognize that the number of solutions to a quadratic equation can be revealed when the equation is written as an expression in factored form equal to zero. </li>
<li> Write an equivalent expression in factored form given a quadratic expression of the form \(ax^2+ bx + c\), where \(a\) is not 1. </li>
<li> Use the intercept form of a quadratic function, \(f(x) = a(x &minus; p)(x &minus; q)\), to define a specific function given its zeros and a point. </li>
</ul>
