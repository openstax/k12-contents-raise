<p>In this culminating project, students use their knowledge of quadratic equations in different forms to solve problems.</p>
<p>In the first activity, students are given a graph of a quadratic function and are asked to write the function in factored form. Students will determine how many solutions a function has based on an understanding of its factored form. They will also be able to explain the characteristics of the graph of a quadratic function with no solution.</p>
<p>In the second activity, students work in pairs to fluently rewrite quadratic expressions in factored and standard form using the strategies learned in the unit.</p>
<p>In the third activity, students find the specific equation in standard form of a quadratic function that has certain zeros and passes through a particular point, given a real-world situation. They will use the equation to make a prediction about the situation, given the context of the problem.</p>
