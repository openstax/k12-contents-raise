<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students solve equations of increasing complexity and do so by reasoning. They begin with linear
  equations, move toward a series of quadratic expressions in factored form, and end with a cubic expression in factored
  form. The progression prompts students to reason about the parts and structure of the expressions, rather than to
  memorize steps for solving without understanding.</p>
<p>As students discuss their reasoning with their partner, listen for those who invoke the zero product property to
  explain how the last four equations could be solved, and those who notice a pattern in how the equations could be
  solved. (Though the last question involves a cubic equation, solving it involves the same reasoning as solving
  quadratic expressions.)</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Tell students to work quietly and answer at least half of the questions before
  discussing their thinking with a partner.</p>
<p>If needed, remind students that some equations have more than one solution. Because we want students to use reasoning
  and the structure of equations to develop their solutions, discourage use of graphing technology in this activity.</p>

    <p><em>Action and Expression: Internalize Executive Functions</em>. To support development of organizational skills, check in with students within the first two to three minutes of work time, especially when students arrive at problems with two solutions. Look for students who quickly recognize that they will need to solve two equations and are organizing their work to account for the appropriate number of solutions for each problem. To support students in recognizing examples with two solutions, demonstrate annotating the problem by writing two equations separately, or drawing arrows from each factor to indicate two solutions. Encourage students to prepare their explanations by recording how they recognized the number of solutions as they work.

<h4>Student Activity </h4>
<p>For each equation, find its solution or solutions. Be prepared to explain your reasoning.</p>
<p>For questions 1&ndash;3, review the process of solving equations.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>\(x&minus;3=0\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=3\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>\(x+11=0\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=-11\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>\(2x+11=0\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=\frac {-11}{2}\)</p>
<p>For questions 4&ndash;7, recall the zero product property means that each (or all) of the factors could be equal to
  zero when their product is zero. Solve each equation by setting each factor equal to zero and solving.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>\(x(2x+11)=0\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=0\) and \(x=\frac {-11}{2}\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>\((x&minus;3)(x+11)=0\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=3\) and \(x=-11\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">

  <li>\(x(x+3)(3x&minus;4)=0\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=0\), \(x=-3\), and \(x= \frac {4}{3}\)</p>
<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Use factors of 48 to find as many solutions as you can to the equation \((x&minus;3)(x+5)=48\).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=7\) and \(x=&minus;9\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Once you think you have all the solutions, explain why these must be the only solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The numbers expressed by \(x&minus;3\) and \(x+5\) are 8 units apart. The <em>only</em>
  factor pairs of 48 that are 8 units apart are 4 and 12, as well as &ndash;4 and &ndash;12.</p>
<p>Think:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> What value of \(x\) would make the factors \((x&minus;3)(x+5)\) equivalent to \((4)(12)\)? \(x=7\). </li>
  <li> What value of \(x\) would make the factors \((x&minus;3)(x+5)\) equivalent to \((-4)(-12)\)? \(x=-9\). </li>
</ul>
<p>Check:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> If \(x=7\), then \((x&minus;3)(x+5) = 4 \cdot 12\). </li>
  <li> If \(x=-9\), then \((x&minus;3)(x+5)=-12 \cdot (-4)\). </li>
</ul>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may incorrectly think that \(x\) can represent a different value in each factor in an equation. For example,
  upon finding \(x=-11\) and \(x=3\) as solutions to \((x&minus;3)(x+11)=0\), they think that one solution is for the
  \(x\) in \((x&minus;3)\) and the other for the \(x\) in \((x&minus;11)\).</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Remind students that solving the equation \((x&minus;3)(x+11)=0\) is like finding the zeros of the function
    defined by \((x&minus;3)(x &minus;11)\). Although there may be two values of \(x\) that lead to 0 for the value of
    \((x&minus;3)(x&minus;11)\), only one input can be entered into the function at a time. Ask students to substitute
    the solutions into the equations and check if the expression is equal to 0 each time. </li>
  <li> When \(x = -11\), the value of the expression is \((-11&minus;3)(-11+11)\) or \((-14)(0)\), which is 0. </li>
  <li> When \(x=3\), the value of the expression is \((3&minus;3)(3+11)\) or \((0)(14)\), which is 0. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their strategies for solving the nonlinear equations. As they explain, record and organize
  each step of their reasoning process and display for all to see.</p>
<p>For example, the equation \((x&minus;3)(2x+11)=0\) tells us that if the product of \((x&minus;3)\) and \((2x + 11)\)
  is 0, then either \(x&minus;3\) is equal to 0 or \(2x+11\) is equal to 0. We can then organize the rest of the solving
  process as:</p>
<p>If \(x&minus;3\) is equal to 0, then \(x\) is 3.</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}x-3&amp;=&amp;0\\x&amp;=&amp;3\end{array}\)</p>
<p>If \(2x+11\) is equal to 0, then \(x=\frac {-11}{2}\).</p>
<p> \(\begin{array}{rcl}2x+11&amp;=&amp;0\\2x&amp;=&amp;-11\\x&amp;=&amp;\frac{-11}2\end{array}\)</p>
<p>The equation is true when \(x=3\) and when \(x=\frac {-11}{2}\).</p>
<p>Emphasize that because at least one of the factors must be 0 for the product to be 0, we can write each expression
  that is a factor as equal to 0 and solve each of these equations separately.</p>
<p>Remind students that we can check our solutions by substituting each one back into the equation and seeing if the
  equation remains true. Although the two factors, \((x&minus;3)\) and \((2x&minus;11)\), won't be 0 simultaneously when
  3 or \(\frac {- 11}{2}\) is substituted for \(x\), the expression on the left side of the equation will have a value
  of 0 because one of the factors is 0.</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> When \(x\) is 3, the expression is \((3&minus;3)(2(3)+11)\) or \((0)(17)\), which is 0. </li>
  <li> When \(x\) is \(\frac {- 11}{2}\), the expression is \((\frac {- 11}{2}&minus;3)(2(\frac {- 11}{2})+11)\) or
    \((\frac {- 17}{2})(0)\), which is 0. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Solving Equations of Increasing Complexity Using Reasoning</h4>
<p>Let's look again at the zero product property.</p>
<br>
<div class="os-raise-graybox">
  <p class="os-raise-text-bold"> ZERO PRODUCT PROPERTY</p>
  <p>If the product of two expressions is 0, then one or both of the expressions equal 0.</p>
  <p>If \(ab=0\), then \(a=0\) or \(b=0\), or \(a=b=0\).</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>We can use the zero product property to help reason through finding the solutions to complex quadratic equations.</p>
<p>We know that if factors are multiplied together and the result is 0, then one of those factors must equal 0.</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 1</p>
<p>\((x&minus;7)(2x+12)=0\)</p>
<p>This equation has two different factors that, when multiplied, result in a product of 0.</p>
<p>To find possible solutions to this equation, we can set each factor equal to 0 and solve.</p>
<p>\((x-7)=0\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(2x+12)=0\)</p>
<p>The value \(x=7\) makes the first factor equal to 0. The value \(x=&minus;6\) makes the second factor equal to 0.</p>
<p>So, the solutions to the original equation are \(x=7\) and \(x=&minus;6\).</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 2</p>
<p>\(x(x&minus;9)(3x&minus;8)=0\)</p>
<p>This equation has three different factors, but the reasoning is the same. We can still set each factor equal to 0 and
  solve.</p>
<p>The first factor is just \(x\). So, \(x=0\) is a solution.</p>
<p>The second factor gives a solution of \(x=9\) when we solve \((x&minus;9)=0\).</p>
<p>The third factor gives a solution of \(x=\frac {8}{3}\) when we solve \((3x&minus;8)=0\).</p>
<p>So, the solutions to \(x(x&minus;9)(3x&minus;8)=0\) are \(x=0\), \(x=\frac {8}{3}\), and \(x=9\).</p>
