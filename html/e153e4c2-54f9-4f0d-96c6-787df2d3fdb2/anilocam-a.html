<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2.11.1: Using Computation and Reasoning</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In this activity, you were familiarized with the computation and reasoning that you will need later to determine the solution region of a linear inequality in two variables.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>2.11.2: Finding Solutions to Inequalities on the Coordinate Plane</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In this activity, you built on your understanding that a linear inequality in one variable has many solutions, which are represented by all the points on one side of a number on a number line. You also recalled that a linear equation in two variables has many solutions, which are represented by all the points on the graph of the equation. </li>
    <li>2.11.2: Self Check</li>
    <li>2.11.2: Additional Resources</li>
  </ul>
  <li>2.11.3: Sketching Solutions to Inequalities</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In this activity, you looked at the regions that represent solutions and non-solutions to inequalities. You recognized that the boundary between the two regions is the graph of an equation that is related to the inequality.</li>

    <li>2.11.3: Additional Resources</li>
  </ul>
  <li>2.11.4: Shading Boundary Line Regions</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In this activity, you considered how to make decisions about which side of the boundary line to shade.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>.</p>
