  <li> The linear function \(g\) is defined by \(g(x)=4x\). </li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li> Show that \(g(3)\) and \(g(2)\) have a difference of 4. <br><br>
      <strong>Answer:</strong> Sample responses:<br>
      <ul>
        <li> \(h(3) = 4^3= 64\), and \(h(2) = 4^2 = 16\). The quotient is \(\frac{64}{16}\), which is 4. </li>
        <li>\(\frac{
          h(3)}{h(2)}=\frac {4^3}{4^2}=4^{3&minus;2} = 4\) </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li> Show that when the input value increases from \(x\) to \(x+1\), the output values \(g(x+1)\) and \(g(x)\) have a difference of 4. <br><br>
      <strong>Answer:</strong> \(g(x+1) &minus; g(x) = 4 \cdot (x+1) &minus; 4x = 4 \cdot (x+1&minus;x) = 4 \cdot (1)\), which equals 4.

    <li> Show that when the input value increases from \(x\) to \(x+1\), the output values \(h(x+1)\) and \(h(x)\) have a quotient of 4. <br><br>
      <strong>Answer:</strong> \(\frac {h(x+1)}{h(x)}=\frac{4^{x+1}}{4^x}=4^{x+1&minus;x} = 4^1\), which equals 4.

<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have additional opportunities to compare linear and exponential growth in Unit 6, so there is no need to slow down.</p>
