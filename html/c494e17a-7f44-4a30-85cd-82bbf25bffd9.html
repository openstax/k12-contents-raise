<h4>Using Inequalities to Solve a Problem</h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example where we might be able to solve a problem using inequalities.</p>
<p>A school is repainting its classroom walls. The school has at most 30 gallons of paint. The painter needs \(\frac52\) gallons of paint for each classroom. How many classrooms can the school paint at most?</p>
<p>We know that the answer is greater than or equal to 0 classrooms, so \(x\geq0\).</p>
<p>We also know that each classroom requires \(\frac52\) or 2.5 gallons of paint.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a guess at how many classrooms and check if we are close to the solution. How many gallons of paint would we need to paint 10 classrooms?</p>
<p>\(10 &times; 2.5 = 25\), and since \(25 &lt; 30\), it could be possible for the school to paint 10 classrooms.</p>
<p>We can try 11 classrooms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\(11 &times; 2.5 = 27.5\), and since \(27.5 &lt; 30\), it could be possible for the school to paint 11 classrooms.</p>
<p>We can try 12 classrooms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\(12 &times; 2.5 = 30\), and since \(30 = 30\), the most classrooms the school could paint is 12 classrooms.</p>
<h4>Try It: Using Inequalities to Solve a Problem</h4>
<p>Use the following information for questions 1 and 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While working in a car factory, a worker can use a drill for as long as the batteries last. The worker has at most 9 fully charged batteries. Each car the worker helps assemble uses \(\frac34\) of a full battery.</p>
