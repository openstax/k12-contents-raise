<p>The graph of a linear function forms a line that goes on forever in both directions. Since the ends go to infinity and negative infinity, linear functions do not have maximums or minimums, unless their domain is restricted to a specific part of the graph.</p>
<p>You can still pick out key features of linear functions.</p>
<p>The \(x\)-intercept, or zero, is where the line crosses the \(x\)-axis. This is where the \(y\)-coordinate is 0.</p>
<p>In this linear function, the \(x\)-intercept, or zero, is \(x= 2\) and written as the point \((2,0)\).</p>
<p>The \(y\)-intercept is where the line crosses the \(y\)-axis and the \(x\)-coordinate is 0.</p>
<p>In this linear function, the \(y\)-intercept is \(y=4\) and written as the point \((0,4)\).</p>
<p>The slope of the line can be found as in previous units as the change in&nbsp;\(y\)&nbsp;over the change in&nbsp;\(x\).<br></p>
<p>\(\mathrm m=\;\frac{\mathrm{rise}}{\mathrm{run}}=\;\frac{\mathrm{change}\;\mathrm{in}\;\mathrm y}{\mathrm{change}\;\mathrm{in}\;\mathrm x}\).</p>
<p>The slope of this linear function is \(m=4-2=-2\).</p>

<p>Here is how to find the intercepts of a linear function:</p>
<p>Since the line crosses the \(x\)-axis at about \((-2.75, 0)\), that is the \(x\)-intercept.</p>
<p>Since the line crosses the \(y\)-axis at \((0,2)\), that is the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p>How did you do? Know that you learn more from wrong answers than from right answers! Wrong answers help us find flaws in our thinking. Take a minute to think about <em>why</em> you got the question wrong. Then you won&rsquo;t get this type of question wrong again!</p>
