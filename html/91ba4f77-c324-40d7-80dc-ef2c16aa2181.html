<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>In an earlier lesson, students encountered relationships where two quantities that could vary multiplied to a
  constant. The focus there was on studying the relationships and describing them using equations in any form. If \( x
  \) and \( y \) are quantities that vary and \( C \) is a constant, they might write \( xy=C \), \( y = \frac{C}{x} \),
or \( x = \frac {C}{y} \). </p>
<p>In this activity, students encounter a similar relationship. The goal here, however, is for students to
  recognize&mdash;by repeatedly calculating the value of one quantity and then the value of the other
  quantity&mdash;that a particular form of equation might be handy for finding one quantity but not so handy for finding
  the other. </p>
<p>When answering the first couple parts of the first question (finding the length of a section given the number of
  volunteers), students can use various strategies to efficiently reason about the answers. They might draw diagrams,
  use proportional reasoning, or think in terms of multiplication (asking, for example, &ldquo;8 times what number
  equals 2?&rdquo;). They might also write an equation such as \( n \cdot \ l = 2 \), substitute the number of
  volunteers for \( n \), and then solve the equation.</p>
<p>As students progress through the parts, they will likely notice that some strategies become less practical for
  finding the value of interest. One strategy, however, will remain efficient: dividing 2 by the number of volunteers,
  or evaluating \( 2 \div n \) or \( \frac2n \) at the given values of \( n \).</p>
<p>Likewise, when answering the third question (finding the number of volunteers given the length of a section),
  students could start out with a variety of strategies and fairly easily find the number of volunteers. Later, however,
  the number of volunteers becomes a bit more cumbersome to find except when using division (that is, dividing 2 by the
  given length, or evaluating \( 2 \div \ l \) or \( \frac {2}{\ l} \) at the given values of \( \ l \)).</p>
<p>Identify students who use these or other approaches and select them to share their strategies during discussion. </p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2 and provide access to calculators. Give students a few minutes of quiet work time and
  then time to share their responses with their partner. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students to present their strategies for solving either set (or both sets) of questions. Start with students
  using the least straightforward approach and end with those who wrote \( l = \frac{2}{n} \) for the first set of
  questions (or \( n = \frac{2}{\ l} \) for the second set of questions).</p>
<p>Emphasize that isolating the variable that we&rsquo;re interested in&mdash;before we substitute any known
  values&mdash;can be an efficient way of solving problems. Once we pin down the variable of interest and see what
  expression is equal to it, we can simply evaluate that expression and bypass some tedious steps.</p>
<p>Highlight that isolating a variable is called &ldquo;solving for a variable.&rdquo; In the road clean-up context, if
  we want to know the length of a road section for which each volunteer would be responsible, we can solve for \( \ l
  \). If we want to know how many volunteers would be needed, we can solve for \( n \).</p>

<h4>Solve a Formula for a Specific Variable</h4>
<p>We have all probably
  worked with some geometric formulas in our study of mathematics.
  Formulas are used in many fields, so it is important to recognize
  formulas and be able to manipulate them easily.</p>
<p>It is often helpful to
  solve a formula for a specific variable. If you need to put a formula
  in a spreadsheet, it is not unusual to have to solve it for a specific
  variable first. We isolate that variable on one side of the equal sign
  with a coefficient of 1, and all other variables and constants are on
  the other side of the equal sign.</p>
<p>Geometric formulas
  often need to be solved for another variable, too. The formula \( V=
  \frac{1}{3} &pi;r^2h \) is used to find the volume of a right circular
  cone when given the radius of the base and height. In the next example,
  we will solve this formula for the height.</p>
<p>Example 1</p>
<p>Solve \(V=\frac{1}{3}πr^2h\) for \(h\).</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Remove the fraction on the right.<br>
  Multiply both sides by 3.<br>
  <img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/9669f1c3605c13fca45ef756dc66969f482a50de" alt="." />
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Simplify.<br>
  <img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/80bab41ddb0d7d65cfc39fd39004be058362ce66" alt="." />
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Divide both sides by \( &pi;r^2 \).<br>
  <img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c187db6fb8bfc8fc85701172ee191718658f7db5" alt="." />
</p>
<p>We could now use this formula
  to find the height of a right circular cone when we know the volume and
  the radius of the base, by using the formula \( h= \frac{3V}{&pi;r^2} \)</p>
<p>In the sciences, we often need to change temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius or vice versa. If you travel in a
  foreign country, you may want to change the Celsius temperature to the more familiar Fahrenheit temperature.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Solve&nbsp;</p>
<p>\( C = \frac{5}{9} ( F - 32 ) \) for \( F \).</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Remove the fraction on the right.<br>
  Multiply both sides by 9/5.<br>

</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Simplify.<br>

</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add 32 to both sides.<br>

</p>
<p>Continue explanation as is</p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>
<p>Solve the formula \( 8x + 7y = 15 \) for \( y \).</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Subtract 8x from both sides to isolate the term with \(y\).<br>

</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Divide both sides by 7 to make the coefficient of \(y\) equal to 1.<br>

</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Simplify.</p>
<p> \(\frac{2d}{t}=(v_0+ v)\)</p>
<p>Now, try to solve \(d =\frac{1}{2} (v_0 + v)^t\) for \(v_0\).</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Remove the fraction on the right.<br>
  Multiply by 2.<br>
  \(2 \times d =2 \times \frac{1}{2} (v_0+ v)t\) </p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Simplify.<br>
  \(2d =(v_0+ v)t\) </p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Divide both sides by \(t\).<br>
  \(\frac{2d}{t}=\frac{(v_0+ v)^t}{t}\) </p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Simplify.<br>
  \(\frac{2d}{t}=(v_0+ v)\) </p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Subtract \(v\) from both sides to solve for v0.<br>
  \(\frac{2d}{t}-v=v_0+ v-v\) <br>
  \(\frac{2d}{t}-v=v_0\) </p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<h4>Try It: Solve a Formula for a Specific Variable</h4>
<p>Solve \(8x+7y=15\) for \(x\)
</p>
<p>Here is how to solve this equation for \(x\).</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Subtract \(7y\) from each side.<br>
  \( 8x+ 7y -7y =15 -7y \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Simplify.<br>
  \( 8x =15-7y \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Divide both sides by 8.<br>
  \( \frac{8x}{8}=\frac{15-7y}{8} \)</p>
  <p>The equation solved for \( x \) is \( x=\frac{15}{8}-\frac{7y}{8} \).</p>
