      <h3>Activity (15 minutes)
      </h3>
        <p>In an earlier lesson, students encountered relationships where two quantities that could vary multiplied to a constant. The focus there was on studying the relationships and describing them using equations in any form. If \( x \) and \( y \) are quantities that vary and \( C \) is a constant, they might write \( xy=C \), \( y = \frac{C}{x} \), or \( x = \frac {C}{y} \). </p>
        <p>In this activity, students encounter a similar relationship. The goal here, however, is for students to recognize&mdash;by repeatedly calculating the value of one quantity and then the value of the other quantity&mdash;that a particular form of equation might be handy for finding one quantity but not so handy for finding the other. </p>
        <p>When answering the first couple parts of the first question (finding the length of a section given the number of volunteers), students can use various strategies to efficiently reason about the answers. They might draw diagrams, use proportional reasoning, or think in terms of multiplication (asking, for example, &ldquo;8 times what number equals 2?&rdquo;). They might also write an equation such as \( n \cdot \ l = 2 \), substitute the number of volunteers for \( n \), and then solve the equation.</p>
        <p>As students progress through the parts, they will likely notice that some strategies become less practical for finding the value of interest. One strategy, however, will remain efficient: dividing 2 by the number of volunteers, or evaluating \( 2 \div n \) or \( \frac2n \) at the given values of \( n \).</p>
        <p>Likewise, when answering the third question (finding the number of volunteers given the length of a section), students could start out with a variety of strategies and fairly easily find the number of volunteers. Later, however, the number of volunteers becomes a bit more cumbersome to find except when using division (that is, dividing 2 by the given length, or evaluating \( 2 \div \ l \) or \( \frac {2}{\ l} \) at the given values of \( \ l \)).</p>
        <p>Identify students who use these or other approaches and select them to share their strategies during discussion. </p>
      <h4>Launch</h4>
        <p>Arrange students in groups of 2 and provide access to calculators. Give students a few minutes of quiet work time and then time to share their responses with their partner. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>
      <h4>Student Activity</h4>
              <p>After a parade, a group of volunteers is helping pick up the trash along a 2-mile stretch of a road.</p>
              <p>The group decides to divide the length of the road so that each volunteer is responsible for cleaning up a section of equal length. </p>

      <h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
        <p>Select students to present their strategies for solving either set (or both sets) of questions. Start with students using the least straightforward approach and end with those who wrote \( \l = \frac{2}{n} \) for the first set of questions (or \( n = \frac{2}{\ l} \) for the second set of questions).</p>
        <p>Emphasize that isolating the variable that we&rsquo;re interested in&mdash;before we substitute any known values&mdash;can be an efficient way of solving problems. Once we pin down the variable of interest and see what expression is equal to it, we can simply evaluate that expression and bypass some tedious steps.</p>
        <p>Highlight that isolating a variable is called &ldquo;solving for a variable.&rdquo; In the road clean-up context, if we want to know the length of a road section for which each volunteer would be responsible, we can solve for \( \ l \). If we want to know how many volunteers would be needed, we can solve for \( n \).</p>

              <h4>Solve a Formula for a Specific Variable</h4>
              <p>We have all probably
                worked with some geometric formulas in our study of mathematics.
                Formulas are used in many fields, so it is important to recognize
                formulas and be able to manipulate them easily.</p>
              <p>It is often helpful to
                solve a formula for a specific variable. If you need to put a formula
                in a spreadsheet, it is not unusual to have to solve it for a specific
                variable first. We isolate that variable on one side of the equal sign
                with a coefficient of 1, and all other variables and constants are on
                the other side of the equal sign.</p>
              <p>Geometric formulas
                often need to be solved for another variable, too. The formula \( V=
                \frac{1}{3} &pi;r^2h \) is used to find the volume of a right circular
                cone when given the radius of the base and height. In the next example,
                we will solve this formula for the height.</p>
              <p><strong>Example<br></strong><br>Solve the formula \( V= \frac{1}{3} &pi;r^2h \) for \( h \).</p>
              <table data-label id="fs-id1167828349231" summary="Write the formula. It is V is equal to one-third times pi times r squared times h. Clear the fractions by multiplying each side by 3. The result is 3 times V is equal to 3 times third times pi times r squared times h. Simplify. The result is 3 V is equal to pi times r squared times h. Divide both sides by pi times r squared. The result is 3 V divided by pi times r squared is equal to h.">
