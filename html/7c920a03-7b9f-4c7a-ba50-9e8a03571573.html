<p dir="ltr">When Quinn returned from vacation, he turned the heat back on in his home. He set the temperature as high as it could go. The function \(Q = 16 +0.4t\) represents the temperature in Quinn&rsquo;s home (in degrees Celsius) after \(t\) minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">How much will the temperature increase after 5 minutes?</p>
