<p dir="ltr">Here are some questions for discussion.</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;What is the best fit?&rdquo; (the best linear model for the data)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How do you know that you have a line of best fit?&rdquo; (You can use technology to generate the line of best fit, but then you need to graph it on the scatter plot to verify that it fits the data well. It needs to follow the trend of the data, it should go roughly through the middle of the data, and it should have roughly the same number of data points on either side of it.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Which line fits the data better, the solid line or the dashed line? Do you think it is the line of best fit? Be prepared to show your reasoning.&rdquo; (The dashed line fits the data better because its slope and vertical intercept more closely resemble the trend of the data than the slope and vertical intercept of the solid line. It is not the line of best fit because it does not go through the middle of the data. It should be a little lower on the graph.)&nbsp;</li>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
