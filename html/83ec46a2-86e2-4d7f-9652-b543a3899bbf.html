<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Find the maximum or minimum of a function by writing the quadratic expression that defines it in vertex form. </li>
  <li> Explain why the vertex is a maximum or minimum when given a quadratic function in vertex form. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 9.9.1: Maximum and Minimum Value of a Function </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you reviewed the meaning of maximum or minimum value of a function. Then you practiced interpreting the language related to maximum and minimum values of functions. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 9.9.2: Does the Vertex Represent the Minimum or Maximum Value? </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you used the vertex form to find out if a vertex represents the minimum or the maximum value of each function. </li>
    <li> 9.9.2: Self Check </li>
    <li> 9.9.2: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 9.9.3: Comparing Maximums between Quadratics </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you were given two functions in different forms. One was graphed, and the other was in factored form. You used these two pieces of information, without creating a graph of the function in factored form, to determine the maximum value of each one. </li>
    <li> 9.9.3: Self Check </li>
    <li> 9.9.3: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 9.9.4: Maximum, Minimum, and Analyzing the Vertex </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you found the vertex of the graph of a quadratic function and then determined if the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex corresponded to a maximum or a minimum value of the function. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 9.9.5: Practice </li>
</ul>
