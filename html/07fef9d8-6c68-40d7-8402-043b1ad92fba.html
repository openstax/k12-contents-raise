<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this culminating lesson, students synthesize methods of solving quadratic equations and graphing quadratic functions to answer questions about quadratic functions within a context. They use tools learned throughout this unit to grapple with solving problems, without scaffolding, about a quadratic function that represents a context, and finding the points of intersection of a parabola and a line. Since this work requires using what students know to tackle an unfamiliar problem, students need to make sense of problems and demonstrate perseverance.</p>
<p>The lesson consists of two substantial problems. You might decide to have all students attempt both problems and select students with different approaches to share their solutions with the class. Alternatively, you might allow students to choose one of the two problems and prepare a visual display of their solution, conducting a gallery walk or a group presentation at the end of the lesson.</p>
<p>Technology isn't required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems. We recommend making technology available.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> Choose and write the appropriate form for expressing a quadratic function to solve a problem. </li>
<li> Interpret features of graphs and expressions that represent quadratic functions to gain information about the situations being modeled. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> Interpret information about a quadratic function given its equation or a graph. </li>
<li> Rewrite quadratic functions in different but equivalent forms of my choosing and use that form to solve problems. </li>
<li> In situations modeled by quadratic functions, decide which form to use depending on the questions being asked. </li>
</ul>
