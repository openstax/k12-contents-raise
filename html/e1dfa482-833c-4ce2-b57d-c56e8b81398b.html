<p>Refer back to the situations in the last two activities. Discuss with students why, for each relationship to be a function, it makes sense for time to be the independent variable and the other quantity to be the dependent variable. Ask students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;In the situation that involved time and number of barks, suppose the number of barks is the input and the time is the output. Is it possible that when the number of barks is 6, both 15 seconds and 16 seconds have passed?&rdquo; (Yes)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Can the time be a function of the number of barks? Why or why not?&rdquo; (No, because for any number of barks, more than one possible time could be the output.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;In the situation that involved time and the total distance the dog walked, suppose the distance is the input and the time is the output. Is it possible that when the dog has walked 27 feet, 50 seconds, 55 seconds, and 60 seconds have passed?&rdquo; (Yes)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Can the time be a function of the total distance walked? Why or why not?&rdquo; (No, because for any number of feet walked, many possible numbers of seconds could have passed.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If time permits, ask students to think of another example of a possible function in that situation (the number of times the dog was petted by a passerby as a function of time, for example), and to identify the input and output variables.</p>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
