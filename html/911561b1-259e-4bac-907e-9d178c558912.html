<p>Your answer may vary, but here are some samples.</p>
<p>A doesn’t belong because it is the only scatter plot with data that fit a line well and are increasing.</p>
<p>B doesn’t belong because it is the only scatter plot with data that would not fit a line well and do not show a pattern. </p>
<p>C doesn’t belong because it is the only scatter plot with data that would fit a line well and are decreasing.</p>
<p>D doesn’t belong because it is the only scatter plot with data that would not fit a line well and do show a curved pattern. </p>
