<p>In the lesson, students used a number of ways to reason about the relationship between quantities and to write an
  equation to represent that relationship. Invite them to summarize those reasoning strategies, which might
  include:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>creating a table to help us see how a quantity changes or how two quantities might be related.</li>
  <li>looking for a pattern in the table; for example, noticing how the values in a table change from one row to the
    next or from one column to the next.</li>
  <li>trying different numbers for one variable and observing how they affect the other variables.</li>
</ul>
<p>Select a couple of tables and descriptions of situations from the lesson to elicit students&rsquo; reflections. Or,
  if time permits, consider using these two new situations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A student starts a new semester with $30 in their lunch account. Each lunch at school costs $1.75. What&rsquo;s
    the relationship between the number of school lunches purchased, \(n\), and the dollar amount in the account, \(A\)?
  </li>
  <li>A chef is pouring oil from a large jug into equal-size bottles. This table shows the relationship between the
    number of bottles used and the volume of oil, in fluid ounces, in each bottle.</li>
</ul>
<table class="os-raise-midsizetable">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">
        number of bottles
      </th>
      <th scope="col">
        fluid ounces per bottle
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        3
      </td>
      <td>
        24
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        4
      </td>
      <td>
        18
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        6
      </td>
      <td>
        12
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        8
      </td>
      <td>
        9
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        \( b \)
      </td>
      <td><br></td>
    </tr>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
