<p>In the lesson, students used a number of ways to reason about the relationship between quantities and to write an
  equation to represent that relationship. Invite them to summarize those reasoning strategies, which might
  include:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>creating a table to help us see how a quantity changes or how two quantities might be related.</li>
  <li>looking for a pattern in the table; for example, noticing how the values in a table change from one row to the
    next or from one column to the next.</li>
  <li>trying different numbers for one variable and observing how they affect the other variables.</li>
</ul>
<p>Select a couple of tables and descriptions of situations from the lesson to elicit students&rsquo; reflections. Or,
  if time permits, consider using these two new situations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A student starts a new semester with $30 in their lunch account. Each lunch at school costs $1.75. What&rsquo;s
    the relationship between the number of school lunches purchased, \(n\), and the dollar amount in the account, \(A\)?
  </li>
  <li>A chef is pouring oil from a large jug into equal-size bottles. This table shows the relationship between the
    number of bottles used and the volume of oil, in fluid ounces, in each bottle.</li>
</ul>
