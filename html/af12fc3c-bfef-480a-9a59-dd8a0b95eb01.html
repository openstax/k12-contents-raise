<p>Supratim Das is a PhD candidate at MIT. He is doing his part to help fight global climate change by trying to produce a longer-lasting battery. He believes that by producing longer-lasting batteries for our mobile devices and our cars, we can reduce our overall energy consumption. Mr. Das can use functions to help him calculate energy inputs and outputs. </p>
<p>In this section, you will expand your understanding of functions. You will use function notation to represent statements about a function and interpret statements in function notation in terms of a situation. You will learn that some functions can be defined with a rule and that the rule can be expressed in function notation. You will use the rule of a function to find the output when the input is given.</p>
<p>This section includes 5 lessons:</p>
