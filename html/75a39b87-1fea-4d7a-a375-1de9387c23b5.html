<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Facing Statement</h4>
<p>A squirrel runs up and down a tree.</p>
<p>The graph shows the height of the squirrel, \(h\) (feet), as a function of time, \(t\) (seconds).</p>
<p><img alt="Piecewise graph. Horizontal axis, 0 to 8, time, seconds. Vertical axis, 0 to 16, height, feet. Graph starts at 0 comma 9, increases, deceases to 4 comma 0, increases, then flattens out at 6 comma 10." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/50aa7651b1fe19a899593f61b9abfcf0b087a126"></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>What is the highest point the squirrel reaches?</li>
  <li>Solve \(h(t)=0\). What does this solution tell you about the squirrel?</li>
  <li>Find the vertical intercept of the graph. What does it tell you about the squirrel?</li>
</ol>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>14 feet</li>
  <li>\(t=4\) means that after 4 seconds, the squirrel is at the bottom of the tree on the ground.</li>
  <li>\((0,9)\) means that at the beginning, the squirrel is 9 feet high in the tree.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5> More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
