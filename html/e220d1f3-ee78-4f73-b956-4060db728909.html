<h3> Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm-up allows students to practice writing equivalent expressions. It prepares students to use this skill as they work with complex expressions arising from linear and exponential functions in this lesson.</p>
<p>For each given expression, write an equivalent expression with as few terms as possible.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>\(
    7p&minus;3+2(p+1)\) <br>
<br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> \(9p&minus;1\) <br>
<br>
</li>
<li> \(\lbrack 4(n+1)+10 \rbrack&minus;4(n+1)\) <br>
<br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> \(
    10\) <br>
<br>
</li>
<li> \(9^5 \cdot 9^2 \cdot 9^x\) <br>
<br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> \(9^{7+x}
    \)<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>\(\frac{
    2^{4n}}{2^n}\) <br>
<br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> \(2^{3n}\)
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share how they manipulated the expressions. If not already mentioned in students&rsquo; explanations, bring up how arithmetic properties of operations (distributive, commutative) and properties of exponents come into play in writing equivalent expressions.</p>
