    <p>Dyslexia impacts a student&rsquo;s math learning by causing difficulty with accuracy, fluency, spelling, and decoding. Students also need support with reading comprehension, vocabulary, and background knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The following instructional accommodations can directly support students with dyslexia in the math classroom. </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Copies of notes, including graphic examples, to support the narrative </li>
      <li> Word banks and explain key terminology in problem-solving to help with vocabulary building </li>
      <li> Formula charts to help with retrieval of information and working memory </li>
      <li> Grid or graph paper to help align for problem-solving </li>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Dysgraphia is a neurodevelopmental disorder manifested by illegible and inefficient handwriting due to difficulty with letter formation. This difficulty is the result of deficits in graphomotor function (hand movements used for writing) and storing and retrieving orthographic codes (letter forms) (Berninger 2015).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Dysgraphia impacts a math student&rsquo;s ability to clearly write equations, change written information with erasures, quickly and accurately capture notes during class, and align place values for long-form calculations.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The following instructional accommodations can directly support students with dysgraphia in the math classroom.&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Handouts and notes reduce the time, effort, and anxiety when capturing information and increase accuracy.&nbsp; </li>
      <li> Calculators to reduce long-form calculations when other skills are being assessed.&nbsp; </li>
      <li> Grid or graph paper to help align for problem-solving. </li>
      <li> Oral or visual assessments to reduce reliance on written work. </li>
      <li> Digital interactive worksheets that allow students to type answers into blanks.&nbsp; </li>

    <p>While dyslexia affects a learner&rsquo;s ability to read, dyscalculia affects a learner&rsquo;s ability to do math. Dyscalculia is a specific learning disorder impacting how a learner builds an understanding of quantitative information and mathematics. Their brains don&rsquo;t process numbers and math information in the same way other learners do. This learning disability typically appears in childhood when learners struggle to perform basic math procedures. Dyscalculia can also be a root of math anxiety.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>These skills are needed to help build knowledge and skills in the math classroom. If a student has dyscalculia and difficulty in these skill areas, they may need accommodations and modifications.&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Visual processing: A math problem often has many pieces. Students must see them all, process them, and then decide what to do with what they see. </li>
      <li> Short-term memory: Short-term memory helps a student retain, retrieve, and use the details and quantities of problems to solve for an answer. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li> Language: Math has language, vocabulary, and symbols unique to each topic students study. Algebraic language is different from geometric language. Students must use the processing part of their brain to translate language into action. </li>
      <li> Long-term memory: Once a student learns a mathematical process, it is stored in their long-term memory. They must retrieve and use that information efficiently for fluency and accuracy. </li>
      <li> Understanding of quantities and amounts: Students need to be able to quantify a numeral&rsquo;s symbolic meaning. They usually learn this principle by manipulating or using other tangible items to build that cognitive skill. </li>
      <li> Calculation: Pulling all these skills together helps a student solve written problems for a numeric answer.&nbsp; </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Features built into these Algebra 1 materials that make them more accessible to students with visual impairments include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> A color palette using colors that are distinguishable to people with the most common types of color blindness </li>
      <li> Tasks and problems designed such that success is independent of the ability to distinguish between colors </li>
      <li> Mathematical diagrams presented in scalable vector graphic (SVG) format, which can be magnified without loss of resolution and rendered in Braille </li>
      <li> Where possible, text associated with images is not part of the image file but instead included as an image caption accessible to screen readers </li>
      <li> &ldquo;Alt text&rdquo; on all images makes the materials more accessible to interpret for users with screen readers </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If students with visual impairments are accessing the materials using a screen reader, it is essential to understand:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> All images in the curriculum have alt text: a concise indication of the image&rsquo;s contents so that the screen reader doesn&rsquo;t skip over as if nothing is there </li>
      <li> Some images have a longer description to help students with visual impairments recreate the image in their minds </li>
    </ul>
