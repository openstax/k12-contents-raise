<h4>Using the Calculator for Approximate Solutions</h4>
<p>Let's look at the solutions to the equations from 9.5.2: Additional Resources:</p>
<p>A more compact way to write the two solutions to the equation \((x+4)^2=11\) is: \(x=-4 \pm \sqrt{11}\).</p>
<p>How large or small are those numbers? Are they positive or negative? We can use a calculator to compute the approximate values of both expressions:</p>
<p>\(-4+ \sqrt{11} \approx -0.683\)	or	\(-4- \sqrt{11} \approx -7.317\)</p>
<p>We can also approximate the solutions by graphing. The equation \((x+4)^2=11\) is equivalent to \((x+4)^2&minus;11=0\), so we can graph the function \(y=(x+4)^2&minus;11\) and find its zeros by locating the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph.</p>
