<h4>Representing Everyday Situations with Graphs</h4>
<p>Graphing functions to represent everyday situations can be useful to provide a visual for what is happening in a situation.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>The graph shows the distance \(y\),&nbsp;in miles, for the time of each of Mia&rsquo;s runs \(x\),&nbsp;in minutes.</p>
<p><img alt class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="309" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b85ad054e4200a3eb0376cefbab471ff715d98fc" width="300"></p>
<br>
<p>Notice that at 0 minutes, Mia has run 0 miles. At 30 minutes, Mia has run 3 miles. At 180 minutes, Mia has run 18 miles.</p>

<p>Sky spends 5 hours at the library. She is on their internet for an hour. Then she takes an hour break to read a book. She then is back online for 2 hours before her friend comes to talk for an hour. She spends her last hour at the library on the internet.</p>
