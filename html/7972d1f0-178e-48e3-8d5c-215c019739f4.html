<h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>
<p>This lesson serves two main goals. The first goal is to revisit the idea (first learned in middle school) that not all systems of linear equations have a single solution. Some systems have no solutions, and others have infinitely many solutions. The second goal is to investigate different ways to determine the number of solutions to a system of linear equations.</p>
<p>Earlier in the unit, students learned that the solution to a system of equations is a pair of values that meet both constraints in a situation and that this condition is represented by a point of intersection of two graphs. Here, students make sense of a system with no solutions in a similar fashion. They interpret it to mean that there is no pair of values that meet both constraints in a situation and that there is no point at which the graphs of the equations would intersect.</p>
<p>Next, students use what they learned about the structure of equations and about equivalent equations to reason about the number of solutions. For instance, students recognize that equivalent equations have the same solution set. This means that if the two equations in a system are equivalent, we can tell&mdash;without graphing&mdash;that the system has infinitely many solutions. These exercises are opportunities to look for and make use of structure.</p>
<p>Likewise, students are aware that the graphs of linear equations with the same slope but different vertical intercepts are parallel lines. If the equations in a system can be rearranged into slope-intercept form (where the slope and vertical intercept become &ldquo;visible&rdquo;), it is possible to determine how many solutions a system has without graphing.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h3>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Determine whether a system of equations will have 0, 1, or infinitely many solutions by analyzing their structure or by graphing.</li>
  <li>Recognize that a system of linear equations can have 0, 1, or infinitely many solutions.</li>
  <li>Use the structure of the equations in a linear system to make sense of the properties of their graphs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Determine how many solutions a system of equations could have.<br>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners </h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS.  The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines. </p>
<ul>
  <li>ELPS 1(F) use accessible language and learn new and essential language in the process </li>
  <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audio tape, video, DVD, and CD ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(F) ask and give information ranging from using a very limited bank of high-frequency, high- need, concrete vocabulary, including key words and expressions needed for basic communication in academic and social contexts, to using abstract and content-based vocabulary during extended speaking assignments </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(I) adapt spoken language appropriately for formal and informal purposes </li>
