<p>
    In this project, you will apply your prior knowledge about plotting coordinate points, evaluating expressions using the correct order of operations, and simplifying algebraic expressions, to generate initial ideas about functions.
  </p>
  
  <p>First, you will be asked to play with a simulation for a few minutes. This open play time allows for you to learn how to use a simulation for learning and discover how to interact with it. You will have an opportunity to share how you used the simulation during the open play time. Be sure you are aware of the controls and how to use the simulation.</p>
  
  <p>When you engage with the activity sheet, you should be pausing to discuss some of your responses with a partner. Be prepared to stop and share your individual responses and partner discussions with the whole class.</p>
  
  <p>By the end of the lesson, you should have completed the activity sheets using the simulation, and should be able to describe a function as having inputs, outputs, and behaving consistently. You should also be able to evaluate a function using different inputs, and be able to summarize the impact that certain operations have on the algebraic function, the table of values, the appearance of the graph, and the outputs.</p>
  
  <h3>Project Activities</h3> 
<ol>
    <li>Simulating Relationships <strong>(10 minutes)</strong></li>
    <li>What is a Function? <strong>(15 minutes)</strong></li>
    <li>Different Kinds of Functions <strong>(20 minutes)</strong></li>
</ol>

<h3>Learning Targets</h3> 

  <p>
    When you finish this project, you will have demonstrated how to:</p><ul>
    <li>Define a function as a rule relating each input to exactly one output and consistently acting on inputs.</li>
    <li>Predict outputs of a function using given inputs.</li>
    <li>Describe a linear function in terms of a table, graph, equation, or series of operations.</li>
  </ul>
