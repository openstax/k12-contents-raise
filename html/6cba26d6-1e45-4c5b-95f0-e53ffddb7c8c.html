<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>The mathematical purpose of this activity is for students to describe how two variables are related and to determine whether there is a causal relationship or simply an association. Students should begin to recognize that some variables may be related, but one does not cause the other to change At this point, the
  mathematics of scatter plot analysis cannot determine whether there is a
  causal relationship. The relationship must be thought through carefully
  to decide, based on the situation, whether the related variables have a
  causal relationship. As students analyze the relationships, they are
modeling with mathematics (TEKS 1A and 1F).</p>
<h4>Launch </h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2.
  Tell students there are many possible answers for the questions. After
  quiet work time, ask students to compare their responses to their
  partner’s and decide if they are both correct, even if they are
  different. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>

<p>Create a display of important terms and vocabulary. After the first
    question, invite students to suggest language or diagrams to include that
    will support their understanding of causal relationships. Examples to
    include can be phrases such as, “increased rain causes people to wear
    jackets.” The two variables can be color-coded in two different colors
    to reveal the relationship. Both the axes and the labels can be
    highlighted with the color that connects it to the type of variable it
    addresses.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Each of the scatter plots shows a
  strong relationship. Write a sentence or two describing how you think
  the variables are related.</p>

<li>During the month of April, Elena keeps track of the number of inches
    of rain, or precipitation, recorded for the day and the percentage of people who come to
    school with rain jackets.<br/>

<br/>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Children who are taller are usually older, so they have had more time to be in school and learn more vocabulary.<br/>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>The goal is for students to develop an understanding of what it means
  for a relationship between two variables to be a causal relationship.</p>
<p>Select several students to share their reasoning for the relationship
  between the variables. For each pair of variables, ask students what
  might have <em>caused</em> the variables to be linked. In some cases
  (the first two here), one of the variables causes a change in the other.
  In other cases (the last two here), an additional variable or situation
  is the cause of the change. Stress to students that the first two relationships would be termed causal relationships and the second two would be associations. Ask students to compare and contrast the difference between situations that are causal and those that are merely associations. </p>
<p>Associations may indicate a relationship between data sets or variables, but causal relationships indicate one variable directly causes or impacts the other variable.</p>
<p>Tell students that since most people are used to seeing independent variables on the \( x \)-axis and dependent variables on the \( y \)-axis, the convention is to put the causal variable on the \( x \)-axis and the other variable on the \( y \)-axis
  when one of the variables does cause the other to change. The book club
  scatter plot should probably have the axes switched to meet the
  convention.</p>
<p>Here are some questions for discussion.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Why does an increase in precipitation cause an increase in the
    percentage of people wearing rain jackets?” (When it rains, people
    usually wear coats to stay dry.)</li>
<li>“An increase in the time it takes to read a book does not cause the
    number of pages in the book to increase. Does an increase in the number
    of pages in a book cause the time it takes to read a book to increase?
    Be prepared to show your reasoning.” (Yes, if you switch the axes on the graph, you
    can see that relationship. It is causal because it takes longer to read
    more pages.)</li>
</ul>

<td><p>That’s correct! Check yourself: As a general trend, as the hot dog prices go up, so do the soft drink costs.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>As hot dog prices go up, soft drink prices go down.</p></td>
<td><p>Incorrect. Let’s try again a different way: This describes a negative relationship, but the scatter plot shows a positive relationship. The answer is: At different locations, as hot dog prices increase, small soda prices also increase.</p></td>

<h5>Causal Relationships</h5>
<br/>
<p>A panel is rating different kinds of potato chips. The scatter plot below shows the relationship between their average rating and the price of the chips, along with the line of best fit. How could the variables be related?</p>
<img alt="Graph of a scatter plot and its line of best fit on a coordinate plane. The x-axis represents the price of the chips in dollars and the y-axis represents the average number of points the chips were rated." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="335" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b4ff57162711ed1b7bbf9269ea20bedf3a3fea82" width="361"/><br/>
<br/>
<p>As the price of a bag of chips in dollars increases, the average rating of the bag of chips in points increases. </p>
<p>Does this represent a causal relationship or simply an association?  </p>
<p>In this situation, the independent variable, price, does not seem to cause the rating a person gives the chips. While there appears to be a positive association, there are other factors that may cause the ratings for a bag of chips to go up. For instance, advertising on tv or social media might cause a particular kind of chip to increase in ratings without a change in their price. </p>

<p><img alt="Graph of a scatter plot and its line of best fit on a coordinate plane that shows the relationship between the car age in years, which is represented on the x-axis, and the car's mileage in thousands of miles, which is graphed on the y-axis." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="336" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/325072075bd810b987a3c92d312caebc8e934634" width="361"/></p>
<p>The scatter plot shows a strong relationship. How could the variables be related?</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. As a car gets older, it is expected to have been driven more and have more miles on it as the years go by.</p>
