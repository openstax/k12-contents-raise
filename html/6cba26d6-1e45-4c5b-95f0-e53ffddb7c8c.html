<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>The mathematical purpose of this
  activity is for students to describe how two variables are related and
  to determine whether there is a <strong>causal relationship</strong>.
  Students should begin to recognize that some variables may be related,
  but one does not cause the other to change. At this point, the
  mathematics of scatter plot analysis cannot determine whether there is a
  causal relationship. The relationship must be thought through carefully
  to decide, based on the situation, whether the related variables have a
  causal relationship. As students analyze the relationships, they are
  modeling with mathematics (TEKS 1A and 1F).</p>
<h4>Launch
</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2.
  Tell students there are many possible answers for the questions. After
  quiet work time, ask students to compare their responses to their
  partner&rsquo;s and decide if they are both correct, even if they are
  different. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>
<h4>Support for Students with Disabilities</h4>
<div>
  <p> <em>Representation: Develop Language and Symbols.</em>
    Create a display of important terms and vocabulary. After the first
    question, invite students to suggest language or diagrams to include that
    will support their understanding of causal relationships. Examples to
    include can be phrases such as, &ldquo;increased rain causes people to wear
    jackets.&rdquo; The two variables can be color-coded in two different colors
    to reveal the relationship. Both the axes and the labels can be
    highlighted with the color that connects it to the type of variable it
    addresses.</p>
  <p><em>Supports accessibility for: Conceptual processing; Language</em> </p>

<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<div>
  <p>Each of the scatter plots shows a
    strong relationship. Write a sentence or two describing how you think
    the variables are related.</p>

<h3>Student Response</h3>
<div>
  <p>Compare your answer:</p>
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li>When there is more rain, it is more likely people will wear jackets.</li>
    <li>Longer books will take more time to read.</li>
    <li>When more tickets are left, the party will have fewer people to have loud conversations, so it will be quieter.</li>
    <li>Children who are taller are usually older, so they have had more time to be in school and learn more vocabulary.</li>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<div>
  <p>The goal is for students to develop an understanding of what it means
    for a relationship between two variables to be a causal relationship.</p>
  <p>Select several students to share their reasoning for the relationship
    between the variables. For each pair of variables, ask students what
    might have <em>caused</em> the variables to be linked. In some cases
    (the first two here), one of the variables causes a change in the other.
    In other cases (the last two here), an additional variable or situation
    is the cause of the change.</p>
  <p>Tell students that since most people are used to seeing independent variables on the \( x \)-axis and dependent variables on the \( y \)-axis, the convention is to put the causal variable on the \( x \)-axis and the other variable on the \( y \)-axis
    when one of the variables does cause the other to change. The book club
    scatter plot should probably have the axes switched to meet the
    convention.</p>
  <p>Here are some questions for discussion.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&ldquo;Why does an increase in precipitation cause an increase in the
      percentage of people wearing rain jackets?&rdquo; (When it rains, people
      usually wear coats to stay dry.)</li>
    <li>&ldquo;An increase in the time it takes to read a book does not cause the
      number of pages in the book to increase. Does an increase in the number
      of pages in a book cause the time it takes to read a book to increase?
      Be prepared to show your reasoning.&rdquo; (Yes, if you switch the axes on the graph, you
      can see that relationship. It is causal because it takes longer to read
      more pages.)</li>
  </ul>

        the activity, students will answer the following question to check
        their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</strong></em></p>
