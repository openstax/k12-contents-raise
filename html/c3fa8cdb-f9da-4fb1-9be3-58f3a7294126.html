<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>The purpose of this lesson is for students to work with sequences and describe them recursively in an informal way. A
  sequence is defined here as a list of numbers, while a term (of a sequence) is one of the numbers in the list.</p>
<p>Using the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, students first make sense of the rules of the puzzle before playing with different
  numbers of discs to generate a sequence representing the minimum number of moves needed to complete the puzzle.
  Solving the puzzles provides students opportunities to express regularity in repeated reasoning when they informally
  state a recursive rule for generating the next term in a sequence from the previous term. If students try to convince
  each other that they have found the minimum number of moves to solve the puzzle, they are constructing mathematical
  arguments and critiquing the reasoning of others. While geometric and arithmetic sequences are a focus of the unit,
  the sequence generated from the Tower of Hanoi is neither. This was a deliberate choice to promote student discussion
  since the pattern to generate the sequence is one students are less likely to guess correctly than a more
  straightforward linear or exponential pattern.</p>

<h4> Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Comprehend the term &ldquo;sequence&rdquo; (in written and spoken language) as a list of numbers. </li>
  <li> Describe (orally) a recursive rule for identifying the next term of a simple sequence. </li>
  <li> Generate a sequence that arises from a mathematical context. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Give examples of a sequence </li>
  <li> Explain the meaning of the term &ldquo;sequence.&rdquo; </li>
  <li> Explain the meaning of the term &ldquo;term,&rdquo; as it is used in a mathematical sequence. </li>
</ul>

  </ul>
  <li> 4.14.4: Rules for a Sequence </li>
</ul>
<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 4.14.5: Practice.</p>
<h4> Required Materials</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Internet-enabled device for applet activity </li>
  <ul>
    <li> If not using the digital applet, each student could use a quarter, nickel, penny, and dime, and a piece of
      paper with 3 circles drawn on it. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h4>Required Preparation</h4>
<p>Students should manipulate either physical or digital objects to experiment with the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. For
  physical, each group could use a quarter, nickel, penny, and dime, and a piece of paper with 3 circles drawn on it.
  For students using the digital version of the materials, acquire devices that can run the digital applet. It is ideal
  if each student has their own device.</p>
<p>If you are doing the checker jumping puzzle, each group needs at least 3 tokens each of 2 different colors. These
  could be actual checkers, counting chips, pennies and nickels, or any other appropriate tokens.</p>
<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>
<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson. Encourage students to look
    for these words and notice their use and meanings. </li>
  <li> Encourage students to use key vocabulary words in &ldquo;math talk&rdquo; and their written and oral
    explanations. </li>
  <li> Utilize a word wall. Sample cards are located here: <a

<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>

    <p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are
  only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.
  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and
    reinforce concept and language attainment
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(D) speak using grade-level content area vocabulary in context to internalize new English words and build
    academic language proficiency
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(F) ask and give information ranging from using a very limited bank of high-frequency, high-need, concrete
    vocabulary, including key words and expressions needed for basic communication in academic and social contexts, to
    using abstract and content-based vocabulary during extended speaking assignments
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 5(B) write using newly acquired basic vocabulary and content-based grade-level vocabulary
  </li>
</ul>
