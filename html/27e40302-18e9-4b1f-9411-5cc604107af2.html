<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>The mathematical purpose of this lesson is to informally assess the fit of a function by plotting and analyzing
  residuals. The term residual is introduced as the difference between the \(y\)-value for a point in a scatter plot and
  the value predicted by the linear model for the associated \(x\)-value. The work of this lesson connects to previous
  work because students analyzed bivariate data by creating scatter plots and fitting linear functions to the data. The
  work of this lesson connects to upcoming work because students will use the correlation coefficient to formally assess
  the fit of a function.</p>
<p>When students take turns with a partner matching graphs of residuals to scatter plots that display linear models,
  students trade roles explaining their thinking and listening, providing opportunities to explain their reasoning and
  critique the reasoning of others.</p>
<p>This lesson represents an extension from the TEKS listed and can be used as an enrichment to enhance the studentsâ€™
  understanding of "linear functions that provide a reasonable fit to data" (A4.C).</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Calculate and plot the residuals for a given data set and use the information to determine the goodness of fit for
    a linear model.</li>
  <li>Comprehend the connection between residuals, variability, and whether or not using a linear model is appropriate.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Plot and calculate residuals for a data set and use the information to judge whether a linear model is a good fit.
  </li>

<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>
<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson. Encourage students to look
    for these words and notice their use and meanings.</li>
  <li>Encourage students to use key vocabulary words in &ldquo;math talk&rdquo; and their written and oral explanations.
  </li>
  <li>Utilize a word wall. Sample cards are located here: <a

  <h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
  <p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are
    only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.
    Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ELPS 1(E) internalize new basic and academic language by using and reusing it in meaningful ways in speaking and
      writing activities that build concept and language attainment</li>
    <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to
      build and reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
    <li>ELPS 3(B) expand and internalize initial English vocabulary by learning and using high-frequency English words
      necessary for identifying and describing people, places, and objects, by retelling simple stories and basic
      information represented or supported by pictures, and by learning and using routine language needed for classroom
      communication</li>
    <li>ELPS 3(F) ask and give information ranging from using a very limited bank of high-frequency, high-need, concrete
      vocabulary, including key words and expressions needed for basic communication in academic and social contexts, to
      using abstract and content-based vocabulary during extended speaking assignments</li>
    <li>ELPS 5(B) write using newly acquired basic vocabulary and content-based grade-level vocabulary</li>
  </ul>
