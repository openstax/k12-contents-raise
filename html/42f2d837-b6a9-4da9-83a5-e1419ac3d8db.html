<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm-up encourages students to look for patterns in real numbers, namely the decimal expansions of powers of \(\frac12\). Students are likely to recognize the 5, 25, 125 in the decimal expansion as powers of 5 and use that insight to describe the pattern, to extend it, and to notice other related patterns. In this warm-up, they are not expected to reason about why the non-zero digits of the decimal expansions of powers of \(\frac12\) are related to powers of 5.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Encourage them to think quietly for a minute before sharing their responses with their partner.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>In the table, find as many patterns as you can. Use one or more patterns to help you complete the table. Be prepared to explain your reasoning.</p>

<p> <strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li> Each number is half of the previous number. We can find the next number by multiplying the current number by \(\frac12\) or by 0.5, or by dividing by 2. </li>
  <li> The non-zero digits of the decimals are powers of 5 (\(5^1\), \(5^2\), \(5^3\), etc.), and each time there is an additional decimal place. </li>
  <li> 0.5 can be written as \(\frac{5}{10}\), 0.25 as \(\frac{25}{100}\), and 0.125 as \(\frac{125}{1,000}\). The numerators are powers of 5, and the denominators are powers of 10, so the next two numbers are \(\frac{5^4}{10^4}\), which is \(\frac{65}{10,000}\) or 0.0625, and \(\frac{5^5}{10^5}\), which is \(\frac{3,125}{100,000}\) or 0.03125. </li>
  <li> The denominators in the fractions are powers of 2. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select a few students (or groups) to share their responses. If not already mentioned by students, discuss:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Are the successive numbers exhibiting linear or exponential change? How do you know?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Are the successive numbers getting larger or smaller? How do you know?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>If time permits, consider asking: &ldquo;Why do powers of 5 show up in the decimals?&rdquo;</p>
