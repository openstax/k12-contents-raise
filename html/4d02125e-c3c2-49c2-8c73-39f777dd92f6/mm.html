    <p>Compare your answer:</p>
    <p> Equation A: The only expression that is not in standard form. Or, when written in standard form, it is the only one that has an even number for the constant term.</p>
    <p>Equation B: The only expression in standard form that has a leading coefficient other than 1.</p>
    <p>Equation C: The only expression in standard form that doesn't have three terms. It is the only one without a linear term.</p>
    <p>Equation D: The only expression in standard form that can't be written in factored form. It is prime.</p>
