  <p> It&rsquo;s natural to forget concepts and skills over time. And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to give yourself refreshers &mdash; the more you remind yourself of what you&rsquo;ve already learned, the more you&rsquo;ll be able to remember it into the future.</p>

    <p>Examine the four expressions below. Which one doesn't belong?</p>
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="A">
      <li>\((x + 4)(x &minus; 3)\)</li>
    </ol>
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2" type="A">
      <li>\(3x^2 &minus; 8x + 5\)</li>

      <li>\(x^2 &minus; 25\)</li>

      <li>\(x^2 + 2x + 3\)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There are many possible answers for which equation does not belong in a group with the others. Determine which equation you think should be eliminated and explain your reasoning.</p>

  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-ack">
    <p>Compare your answer:</p>
    <p> Equation A: The only expression that is not in standard form. Or, when written in standard form, it is the only one that has an even number for the constant term.</p>
    <p>Equation B: The only expression in standard form that has a leading coefficient other than 1.</p>
    <p>Equation C: The only expression in standard form that doesn't have three terms. It is the only one without a linear term.</p>
    <p>Equation D: The only expression in standard form that can't be written in factored form. It is prime.</p>
