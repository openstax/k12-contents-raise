  original equation and the first step taken to solve it.</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>\( \begin{align} 5(x-3)&amp;=5\\x-3&amp;=1 \end{align} \)</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>\( \begin{align} 5x-3&amp;=5\\5x&amp;=2 \end{align} \)</p>
<p>C</p>
<p>\( \begin{align} 5(x-3)&amp;=5x\\x-3&amp;=x \end{align} \)</p>
<p>D</p>
<p>\( \begin{align} (5-3)x&amp;=5x\\ 5-3&amp;=5 \end{align} \)</p>
<p>For each set of equations, ask students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;What move was made to the original equation to obtain the second equation?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Is the solution to the second equation the same as the solution to the original equation? Why does it stay
    the same, or why does it change?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure students see that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A: The move made is dividing each side by 5. The solution is the same (\( x=4 \)) because dividing both sides by
    the same number keeps the two sides equal.</li>
  <li>B: The move made is adding 3 to the left side and \(-3\) to the right. The solution of the first equation (\(
    x=\frac85 \)) no longer makes the second equation true because the two sides of the equation are no longer equal.
  </li>
  <li>C: The move made is dividing each side by 5. It is a valid move, but because the original equation does not have a
    solution (5 times a number, \( 5x \), cannot be equal to 5 times a smaller number, \( 5(x-3) \)), the second
    equation also does not have a solution (3 less than a number, \( x-3 \), cannot be equal to that number, \( x \)).
  </li>
  <li>D: The move made is dividing each side by \( x \). The second equation doesn&rsquo;t have a solution even though
    the original solution does. The move is problematic because it would eliminate the variable and make us miss the
    solution, namely \( x=0 \).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
