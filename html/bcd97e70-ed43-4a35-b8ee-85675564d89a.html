        <p>For each set of equations, ask students:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>&ldquo;What move was made to the original equation to obtain the second equation?&rdquo;</li>
          <li>&ldquo;Is the solution to the second equation the same as the solution to the original equation? Why does it stay the same, or why does it change?&rdquo;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Make sure students see that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A: The move made is dividing each side by 5. The solution is the same (<span class="math math-repaired">\( x=4 \)</span>) because dividing both sides by the same number keeps the two sides equal.</li>
          <li>B: The move made is adding 3 to the left side and \(-3\) to the right. The solution of the first equation (<span class="math math-repaired">\( x=\frac85 \)</span>) no longer makes the second equation true because the two sides of the equation are no longer equal.</li>
          <li>C: The move made is dividing each side by 5. It is a valid move, but because the original equation does not have a solution (5 times a number, <span class="math math-repaired">\( 5x \)</span>, cannot be equal to 5 times a smaller number, <span class="math math-repaired">\( 5(x-3) \)</span>), the second equation also does not have a solution (3 less than a number, <span class="math math-repaired">\( x-3 \)</span>, cannot be equal to that number, <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span>).</li>
          <li>D: The move made is dividing each side by <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span>. The second equation doesn&rsquo;t have a solution even though the original solution does. The move is problematic because it would eliminate the variable and make us miss the solution, namely <span class="math math-repaired">\( x=0 \)</span>.</li>
