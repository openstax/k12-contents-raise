<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this culminating project, students integrate ideas from the unit. Students will use the fact that the shape made by water coming out of a jet or fountain can be modeled with a quadratic equation. Students will design a fountain with given criteria.</p>
<p>In the first activity, students work through a simplified example with one fountain and one jet. Students will think about what information is needed to write the equation. They can use a sketch to draw the path. Students decide on some reasonable measurements and write the equation. Understanding the use of the vertex form of a quadratic equation is helpful.</p>
<p>The second activity gives students an opportunity to design a fountain with three to five jets. Students are given certain measurements and criteria to meet to write the equation for paths of the jets. Students may present their equations and an explanation of what information they used and how they wrote the equation of the path of the jets.</p>

<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> A6(B) write equations of quadratic functions given the vertex and another point on the graph, write the equation in vertex form \((f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k)\), and rewrite the equation from vertex form to standard form \((f(x)=ax^2+bx+c\)); and </li>
  <li> A7(A) graph quadratic functions on the coordinate plane and use the graph to identify key attributes, if possible, including \(x\)-intercept, \(y\)-intercept, zeros, maximum value, minimum values, vertex, and the equation of the axis of symmetry; </li>
  <li> A7(C) determine the effects on the graph of the parent function \(f(x)=x^2\) when \(f(x)\) is replaced by \(af(x)\), \(f(x)+d, f(x-c)\), f(bx) for specific values of \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\). </li>

  <li> Recommend making technology available. Having access to graphing technology will streamline the process of testing different equations </li>
</ul>
<h4>Required Preparation</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Consider demonstrating how to use sliders in Desmos to adjust the parameters of a quadratic equation in vertex form. For example, if \(y=-a(x-h)^2+k\) is used to represent a generic quadratic that opens down, students can easily experiment with its shape by moving sliders on \(a\), \(h\), and \(k\). </li>
