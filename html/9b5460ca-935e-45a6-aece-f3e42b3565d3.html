  <h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>

<p>In this project, students will be introduced to an area model as a tool for finding products. They will start with a numerical area model, focusing on two-digit numbers and discovering that you can partition a rectangle into smaller areas whose sum is the total area of the rectangle. They will then apply this area model to algebraic expressions, noticing that an area model can be used to multiply polynomials.</p>

<p>Students will first be asked to play with a simulation for a few minutes. This open play time allows students to learn how to use a simulation for learning, discover how they can interact with it, and feel ownership of their learning from the simulation. Following open play, students can share how to use the simulation, so every student is aware of the controls and how to interact.</p>
    
<p>When students are engaging with the activity sheet, they should be pausing to discuss some of their responses with a partner. The whole class discussions should produce a rich variety of thoughts and observations based on individual responses and partner discussions. </p>
    
<p>By the end of the lesson, students should have completed the activity sheets using the simulation, and should be able to use an area model to multiply two two-digit numbers or two polynomials, and explain why an area model can be used to find the product of two factors. </p>
