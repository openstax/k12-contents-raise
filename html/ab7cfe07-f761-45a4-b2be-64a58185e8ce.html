<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)<br></h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>A school is holding a carnival and hopes to raise $500. Child tickets cost $3, and adult tickets cost $5. If the
  school sells \( x \) child tickets and \( y \) adult tickets, then the equation \( 3x + 5y = 500 \) expresses the fact
  that the school raised exactly $500 from ticket sales.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Solve the equation for \( x \).
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( x=\frac{500-5y}3 \)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Explain when it might be helpful to rewrite the equation this way.
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. Solving for \( x \) helps us find out the number of child tickets to sell if we
  know the number of
  adults attending the carnival and we want to make exactly $500 from ticket sales.</p>
<h3>Response to Student Thinking</h3>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand
  the mathematical ideas in this cool down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next
  lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the
  next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
