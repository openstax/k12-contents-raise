<h3>Student Facing Statement</h3>
<div class="body">
<p>A school is holding a carnival and hopes to raise <span>$</span>500. Child tickets cost <span>$</span>3, and adult tickets cost $5. If the school sells <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span> child tickets and <span class="math math-repaired">\( y \)</span> adult tickets, then the equation <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3x + 5y = 500 \)</span> expresses the fact that the school raised exactly $500 from ticket sales.</p>
<ol>
<li>Solve the equation for <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span>.
          </li>
<li>Explain when it might be helpful to rewrite the equation this way.
          </li>
</ol>

<h3>Student Response</h3>
<div class="body">
<ol>
<li><span class="math math-repaired">\( x=\frac{500-5y}3 \)</span></li>
<li>For example: Solving for <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span> helps us find out the number of child tickets to sell if we know the number of adults attending the carnival and we want to make exactly <span>$</span>500 from ticket sales.</li>

<div class="body">
<h5>More Chances</h5><br>
<span id="docs-internal-guid-f39b71b8-7fff-7800-8371-bb1198a2ad13">Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</span>
