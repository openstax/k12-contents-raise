<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Describe the meaning of a negative exponent in equations that represent exponential growth and decay.
  </li>
<li>
    Write equations that represent exponential growth and decay to solve problems.
  </li>
<li>Graph an equation that represents exponential decay to solve a problem.</li>
<li>
    Convert numbers between decimal form and scientific notation.
  </li>
<li>
    Use scientific notation to solve problems arising from real-world situations.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
    5.6.1: Checking Exponent Rules
  </li>
<ul>
<li>
      In this activity, you reviewed performing operations with exponents, including negative exponents. You used the Product Property of Exponents to simplify the expressions.
    </li>
</ul>
<li>
    5.6.2: Interpreting Negative Exponents in Exponential Growth
  </li>
<ul>
<li>
      In this activity, you wrote an equation of exponential growth to represent a real-life situation. You interpreted the meaning of negative exponents in this equation. You used negative exponents in exponential growth equations to solve real-world problems.

    5.6.3: Interpreting Negative Exponents in Exponential Decay
  </li>
<ul>
<li>
      In this activity, you wrote an equation of exponential decay to represent a real-life situation. You also created a graph to represent the situation. You interpreted the meaning of negative exponents in this equation. You used negative exponents in exponential decay equations to solve real-world problems.

    5.6.6: Interpreting Negative Exponents and Scientific Notation
  </li>
<ul>
<li>
      In this activity, you interpreted negative exponents in a scenario about the population of fish. Then you changed between the standard from and the scientific notation at specific points.
