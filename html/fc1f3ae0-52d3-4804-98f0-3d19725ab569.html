<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>A toy rocket and a drone were launched at the same time.</p>
<p>Here are the graphs that represent the heights of two objects as a function of time since they were launched.</p>
<p>Height is measured in meters above the ground, and time is measured in seconds since launch.</p>
<p><img alt="A GRAPH OF TWO FUNCTIONS, EACH REPRESENTING THE HEIGHT IN METERS OF AN OBJECT AFTER TIME IN SECONDS HAS PASSED. THE HEIGHT OF THE TOY ROCKET IS MODELED BY AN UPSIDE-DOWN PARABOLA WITH A Y-INTERCEPT OF 25 AND X-INTERCEPT OF 5, WITH A MAXIMUM AT THE POINT (2, 45). THE HEIGHT OF THE DRONE IS MODELED BY A FUNCTION THAT INCREASES LINEARLY FROM X = 0 TO X = 2, UP TO THE POINT (2, 20), REMAINS CONSTANT FROM X = 2 TO X = 5, AND THEN DECREASES LINEARLY FROM X = 5 TO X = 7." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/381549c4047fb4e339394723978be30242415483"></p>

    <p>The toy rocket was launched from a height of 25 meters above ground. It went up quickly, but it slowed down and then stopped getting higher when it reached 45 meters, which was 2 seconds after launch. At that point, it started to come back down. It hit the ground 5 seconds after it was launched.

    <p>The drone took off from the ground. It went up at a constant speed for 2 seconds, up to a height of 20 meters. Then, it hovered at that height for 3 seconds. Afterward, it started descending at a constant speed for 2 seconds. It landed back on the ground 7 seconds after launch.</p>
