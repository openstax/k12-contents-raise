<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In an earlier lesson, students used scatter plots to perform linear regression on a data set. In this lesson, students will familiarize themselves with graphing technology in order to display a data set modeling a quadratic function. They will learn how to use this graphing technology to analyze the data set and generate an equation for a curve of best fit. These equations, modeling real-world situations, can be used to make predictions about those situations.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> Use graphing technology, such as Desmos, to input a data set modeling a quadratic function and display a scatter plot of the data. </li>
<li> Generate an quadratic equation for a curve of best, or regression curve, using graphing technology. </li>
<li> Analyze a situation modeled by a quadratic function and use a curve of best fit to make predictions about that situation. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> Graph a quadratic data set using technology. </li>
<li> Find a regression curve, or curve of best fit, using a quadratic data set. </li>
<li> Use a regression curve to create a quadratic model for making predictions. </li>
<li> Make predictions about a real-world situation using a quadratic data set. </li>
</ul>
