<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In an earlier lesson, students used scatter plots to perform linear regression on a data set. In this lesson, students will familiarize themselves with graphing technology in order to display a data set modeling a quadratic function. They will learn how to use this graphing technology to analyze the data set and generate an equation for a curve of best fit. These equations, modeling real-world situations, can be used to make predictions about those situations.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Use graphing technology, such as Desmos, to input a data set modeling a quadratic function and display a scatter plot of the data. </li>
  <li> Generate an quadratic equation for a curve of best, or regression curve, using graphing technology. </li>
  <li> Analyze a situation modeled by a quadratic function and use a curve of best fit to make predictions about that situation. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Graph a quadratic data set using technology. </li>
  <li> Find a regression curve, or curve of best fit, using a quadratic data set. </li>
  <li> Use a regression curve to create a quadratic model for making predictions. </li>
  <li> Make predictions about a real-world situation using a quadratic data set. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners </h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines. </p>
<ul>
  <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment </li>
  <li>ELPS 2(G) understand the general meaning, main points, and important details of spoken language ranging from situations in which topics, language, and contexts are familiar to unfamiliar </li>
  <li>ELPS 2(H) understand implicit ideas and information in increasingly complex spoken language commensurate with grade-level learning expectations </li>
</ul>
