<p>Compare your answer:</p>
<p>\(y=n^2+n\) or equivalent because there is an \(n\)-by-\(n\) array of small squares, which gives \(n^2\), and then there is a row of \(n\) squares in the lower right.</p>

<div class="os-raise-ib-content" data-schema-version="1.0" data-wait-for-event="Reveal2">
<p>Compare your answer:</p>
<p>The relationship is a quadratic function because the number of squares could be expressed as \(n^2+n\), which is a quadratic expression.</p>
