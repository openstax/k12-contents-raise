      <h3><span>Activity (10 minutes)</span><br></h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>This activity serves two practice goals: writing and graphing linear equations of the form \( Ax + By = C \)&nbsp;to represent a constraint, and interpreting points on a graph in terms of the situation it represents. In this case, only whole-number values are meaningful for both variables (number of dimes and number of nickels). Students need to consider whether decimal solutions are reasonable in the situation.</p>
        <p>Graphing the equation involves some decisions. The axes of the blank coordinate plane are not labeled, so students need to decide which quantity goes on which axis (and to recognize that the decision affects what each point on the graph represents). Students could also choose to draw a continuous graph (a line) or a discrete graph (points at integer values of one variable or both variables).&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As students work, notice the graphing decisions students make. Identify students who draw a discrete graph to have them share their rationales during class discussion.</p>
        <p>Students engage in quantitative and abstract reasoning as they think about the solutions and graph of an equation in context. They practice aspects of modeling as they write an equation for a constraint, decide on representations for the model, and reflect on whether the mathematical results make sense in the given situation.</p>

      <h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>Some students who wish to change their equation from standard form to slope-intercept form may get stuck because they are not sure whether to solve for <span class="math math-repaired">\( n \)</span> or <span class="math math-repaired">\( d \)</span>. Either choice is acceptable, but this is a good opportunity for students to think through the implications of their choice. Ask students: &ldquo;In <span class="math math-repaired">\( y=mx+b \)</span>, which variable goes on the horizontal axis? Which goes on the vertical?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Other students might wish to graph using the equation in standard form without first rewriting it into another form. Ask if they could identify two points on the graph. Alternatively, ask them to think about how many nickels there would be if there were 0 dimes, 1 dime, 2 dimes, and so on, and plot some points accordingly.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>Select previously identified students to share their graphs. For each graph, ask if anyone else also drew it the same way. If no one drew discrete graphs and no one mentioned that fractional values of <span class="math math-repaired">\( d \)</span> or <span class="math math-repaired">\( n \)</span> have no meaning or are not possible in the situation, ask students about it.</p>

        <p>Make sure students understand that all of these graphs are acceptable representations of the relationship between the quantities. A graph showing only points with whole-number coordinate values represents the solutions to the equation accurately but may be time-consuming to draw. A line may be a quicker way to see the possible solutions and can be used for problem solving as long as we are aware that only points with whole-number values make sense.</p>
        <p>For example, when reasoning about the last question, students who used a continuous graph might see that the jar would contain 8.5 dimes if it has no nickels. It is important that they recognize that this is impossible. The same reflection about the context is also necessary if students answered the question by solving the equation for <span class="math math-repaired">\( d \)</span> when <span class="math math-repaired">\( n \)</span> is 0.</p>
        <p>If time permits, discuss these questions to reinforce the connections to earlier work on equivalent equations and their graphs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>&ldquo;Suppose you were to express the relationship between the same quantities, but in dollars instead of in cents. What would the equation look like?&rdquo; (<span class="math math-repaired">\( 0.05n + 0.1d = 0.85 \)</span>)</li>
          <li>&ldquo;What would the graph of this equation look like? Try graphing it on the same coordinate plane.&rdquo; (It would be the same line as the graph for <span class="math math-repaired">\( 5n+10d=85 \)</span>.)</li>
          <li>&ldquo;Why would the graph of this equation be identical to the other one?&rdquo; (The two equations are equivalent. Dividing the first equation, which represents the relationship in cents, by 100 gives the second equation, which represents the relationship in dollars. The same combinations of nickels and dimes make both equations true.)</li>
        </ul>

    <p class="os-raise-text-bold"><em>The following content is available to students who would like more support based on their experience with the self check. Students will not automatically have access to this content, so you may wish to share it with those who could benefit from it.</em></p>            
    <h4>Standard Form of Linear Equation</h4>
    <p>A linear equation is in <strong>standard form</strong> when it is written \(Ax+By=C\).</p>
    <p>Most people prefer to have \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) be integers and \(A\ge 0\) when writing a linear equation in standard form, although it is not strictly necessary.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Linear equations have infinitely many solutions.</li>
      <li>For every number that is substituted for \(x\) there is a corresponding \(y\) value.</li>
      <li>This pair of values is a solution to the linear equation and is represented by the ordered pair \((x,y)\).</li>
      <li>When we substitute these values of \(x\) and \(y\) into the equation, the result is a true statement, because the value on the left side is equal to the value on the right side.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Solution of a Linear Equation in Two Variables</h4>
    <p>An ordered pair \((x,y)\) is a solution of the linear equation \(Ax+By=C\), if the equation is a true statement when the \(x\)&ndash; and \(y\)&ndash;values of the ordered pair are substituted into the equation.</p>
      <p>Linear equations have infinitely many solutions. We can plot these solutions in the rectangular coordinate system. The points will line up perfectly in a straight line. We connect the points with a straight line to get the graph of the equation. We put arrows on the ends of each side of the line to indicate that the line continues in both directions.</p>
      <p>A graph is a visual representation of all the solutions of the equation. It is an example of the saying, &ldquo;A picture is worth a thousand words.&rdquo; The line shows you <em data-effect="italics">all</em>
      the solutions to that equation. Every point on the line is a solution of the equation. And, every solution of this equation is on this line. This line is called the graph of the equation. Points <em data-effect="italics">not</em> on the line are not solutions!</p>
      <p>When a linear equation in standard form is solved for \(y\), it is then easy to pick out the slope of the line and where the graph of the line crosses the \(y\)&ndash;axis.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Solve \( 3x - 9y = 15 \)</p>
      <p><strong>Step 1 - </strong> Move the \(x\) term to isolate the \(y\) term.<br></p>
      <p>Subtract 9x from both sides.</p>
      <p>\( 9x - 9x - 3y = 15 - 9x \)</p>
      <p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Simplify.<br></p>
      <p>\( -3y = 15 - 9x \)</p>
      <p><strong>Step 3 - </strong>Divide by the coefficient of \(y\).<br></p>
      <p>Divide both sides by \(-3\)</p>
      <p>\( \frac{-3y}{3} = \frac{15-9x}{3} \)
      <p><strong>Step 4 - </strong>Simplify.<br></p>
      <p>\( y = -3x + 5 \)</p>
      <p>In the new equation, \( y = -3x + 5 \), the slope is \(-3\) and the graph of the line would cross the \(y\)&ndash;axis at 5.</p>

    <div>
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Step 1 - </strong>  Move the\(x\) term to isolate the \(y\) term.<br></p>
        <p>Subtract \(6x\) from both sides.</p>
        <p>\( 6x - 6x + 2y = 14 - 6x \)</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Simplify.<br></p>
        <p>\(2y = -6x +14\)</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3 - </strong>Divide by the coefficient of \(y\).<br></p>
        <p>Divide both sides by 2.</p>
        <p>\( \frac{2y}{2} = \frac{-6x+14}{2} \)
        <p><strong>Step 4 - </strong>Simplify.<br></p>
