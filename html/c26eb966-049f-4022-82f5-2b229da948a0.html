<p dir="ltr">To prompt students to reflect more broadly on how effectively each form of quadratic expression reveals the features of the graph that represents the expression, consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Asking questions such as: "Suppose two students are debating whether an expression in standard form or in factored form is more useful for sketching the graph representing \(y=(x+1)(x-6)\), which is equivalent to \(y=x^2-5x-6\). Tyler claims that the standard form is more useful. Clare thinks the factored form is the way to go. If you were Tyler, how would you support your claim? What if you were Clare?" </li>
  <li> Drawing a Venn diagram for all to see and asking students to compare the features of a graph that can be identified from standard and factored forms. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
