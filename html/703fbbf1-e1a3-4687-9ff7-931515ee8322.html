<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>This lesson has two key aims. The first aim is to familiarize students with the structure of perfect-square expressions. Students analyze various examples of perfect squares. They apply the distributive property repeatedly to expand perfect-square expressions given in factored form. The repeated reasoning allows them to generalize expressions of the form \((x+n)^2\) as equivalent to \(x^2+2nx+n^2\). (Note, students were first introduced to perfect square trinomials in Unit 6.)</p>
<p>The second aim is to help students see that perfect squares can be handy for solving equations because we can find their square roots.</p>
<p>Achieving these aims prepares students to solve quadratic equations by completing the square in upcoming lessons. Knowing that quadratic equations can be much more easily solved when one side is a perfect square and the other side is a number motivates students to transform expressions into that form. Recognizing the structure of a perfect square equips students to look for features that are necessary to complete a square.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> Comprehend that equations containing a perfect-square expression on both sides of the equal sign can be solved by finding square roots. </li>
<li> Comprehend that perfect squares of the form \((x+n)^2\) are equivalent to \(x^2+2nx+n^2\). </li>
<li> Use the structure of expressions to identify them as perfect squares. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> Recognize perfect-square expressions written in different forms. </li>
<li> Recognize quadratic equations that have a perfect-square expression and solve the equations. </li>
</ul>
