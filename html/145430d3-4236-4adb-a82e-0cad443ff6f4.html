        <p>Previously,
          students saw that an equation in two variables can have many solutions
          because there are many pairs of values that satisfy the equation. This
          activity illustrates that idea graphically. Students see that the
          coordinates of all points on the graphs are pairs of values that make
          the equation true, which means that they are all solutions to the
          equation.</p>
        <p>They also see
          that because the given equation models the quantities and constraints in
          a situation, not all points on the graph are meaningful. For example,
          only positive <span>\( x \)-</span> or <span>\( y \)-</span>values
          on the graph (that is, only points in the first quadrant of the
          coordinate plane) have meanings in this context because almonds and figs
          cannot have negative values for their weight.</p>
        <p>During the
          activity, look for students who perform numerical computations
          straightaway and those who first write a variable equation and then use
          it to answer the first two questions.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Launch</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Arrange students
          in groups of 2 and provide access to calculators. Give students a few
          minutes of quiet work time and then time to share their responses with a
          partner.</p>
        <h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
        <div>
          <p><em>Reading, Listening, Conversing: MLR6 Three Reads. </em>Use
            this routine to support reading comprehension of this word problem. Use
            the first read to orient students to the situation. Ask students to
            describe what the situation is about without using numbers (Clare
            purchased some snacks: salted almonds and dried figs). Use the second
            read to identify quantities and relationships. Ask students what can be
            counted or measured without focusing on the values. Listen for, and
            amplify, the important quantities that vary in relation to each other in
            this situation: the cost per pound of each snack food, the amount of
            each snack food purchased, and the total amount of money spent before
            tax. After the third read, ask students to brainstorm possible
            strategies to determine the amount of one snack food purchased if the
            amount of the other snack food is known. This helps students connect the
            language in the word problem and the reasoning needed to solve the
            problem.<br><em>Design Principle(s): Support sense-making

            <div>
              <p>To
                get snacks for a class trip, Clare went to the &ldquo;bulk&rdquo; section of the
                grocery store, where she could buy any quantity of a product and the
                prices are usually good.</p>
              <p>Clare purchased some salted almonds at <span>$</span>6 a pound and some dried figs at <span>$</span>9 per pound. She spent <span>$</span>75 before tax.</p>

      <div>
        <p>Some students
          may say that the points not on the line are impossible given that Clare
          spent $75. Encourage these students to think about what those points
          would mean if we didn&rsquo;t know how much money Clare spent.</p>

      <h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Display the graph for all to see. Invite students to
          share their equation for the situation and their interpretations of the
          points on and off the graph. Make sure students understand that a point
          on the graph of an equation in two variables is a solution to the
          equation. Discuss questions such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>&ldquo;What does the point \( (10, 3) \) mean in this situation?&rdquo; (Clare purchased 10 pounds of almonds and 3 pounds of figs.)</li>
          <li>&ldquo;Is that a possible combination of pounds of
            figs and almonds? Why or why not?&rdquo; (No. It doesn&rsquo;t lie on the graph.
            Also, if Clare bought 10 pounds of almonds and 3 pounds of figs, it
            would cost her $87, not $75.)</li>
          <li>&ldquo;From the graph, it looks like \( (7, 3.5) \)
            might be a solution, but it is hard to know for sure. Is there a way to
            verify?&rdquo; (Substitute the values into the equation and see if they make
            the equation true.)</li>
          <li>&ldquo;Suppose we extend the two ends of the graph beyond the first quadrant. Would a point on those parts of the line&mdash;say, \( (-1, 9) \)&mdash;be a solution to the equation \( 6a+9f=75 \)?
            Why or why not?&rdquo; (It would still be a solution to the equation, but it
            wouldn&rsquo;t make sense in this context. The weight of almonds or figs
            cannot be negative.)</li>

                        <p>Suppose
                          we are buying beans and rice to feed a large gathering of people, and we
                          plan to spend $120 on the two ingredients. Beans cost $2 a pound, and
                          rice costs $0.50 a pound.<br></p>
                        <p>If&nbsp;<span>\( x \)</span>&nbsp;represents pounds of beans and&nbsp;<span>\( y \)</span>&nbsp;pounds of rice, the equation&nbsp;<span>\( 2x + 0.50y = 120 \)</span>&nbsp;can represent the constraints in this situation.</p>
                        <p>The graph of&nbsp;<span>\( 2x + 0.50y = 120 \)</span>&nbsp;shows a straight line.</p>
                        <div><img alt="Graph of a line. Vertical axis, pounds of rice. Horizontal axis, pounds of beans." height="232" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/586a7b603355fd20cb8f01e888ce5baf39f6a9e6" width="400"><br><br></div>
                        <p>Each point on the line is a pair of&nbsp;\( x \)-
                          and&nbsp;\( y \)-values that make the equation true and is thus a solution.
                          It is also a pair of values that satisfy the constraints in the
                          situation.</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>The point&nbsp;\( (10, 200) \)&nbsp;is on the
                            line. If we buy 10 pounds of beans and 200 pounds of rice, the cost will
                            be&nbsp;\( 2(10) + 0.50(200) \), which equals 120.</li>
                          <li>The points&nbsp;\( (60, 0) \)&nbsp;and&nbsp;\( (45, 60)
                            \)&nbsp;are also on the line. If we buy only beans&mdash;60 pounds of them&mdash;and no
                            rice, we will spend&nbsp;$120. If we buy 45 pounds of beans and 60 pounds of
                            rice, we will also spend&nbsp;$120.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>What about points that are&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;on the line? They are not solutions because they don&rsquo;t satisfy the constraints, but they still have meaning in the situation.</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>The point&nbsp;\( (20, 80) \)&nbsp;is not on the
                            line. Buying 20 pounds of beans and 80 pounds of rice costs&nbsp;\( 2(20) +
                            0.50(80) \)&nbsp;or 80, which does not equal 120. This combination costs less
                            than what we intend to spend.</li>
                          <li>The point&nbsp;\( (70, 180) \)&nbsp;means that we
                            buy 70 pounds of beans and 180 pounds of rice. It will cost&nbsp;\(
                            2(70)+0.50(180) \)&nbsp;or 230, which is over our budget of 120.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example.</p>
                        <p>Looking again at the graph above, would the point \((30, 120)\) be a solution, and what is the meaning in the situation?</p>
                        <p>Yes; the point means that 30 pounds of beans
                          and 120 pounds of rice were purchased. Since the point is on the line,
                          the total spent was $120.</p>
