<h4>Revenue Represented with Quadratics</h4>
<p>Quadratic functions often come up when studying revenue. (Revenue means the money collected when someone sells something.)</p>
<p>Suppose we are selling raffle tickets and deciding how much to charge for each ticket. When the price of the tickets is higher, typically fewer tickets will be sold.</p>
<p>Each ticket has a price of \(d\) dollars, and it is possible to sell \(600-75d\) tickets. We can find the revenue by multiplying the price by the number of tickets expected to be sold. A function that models the revenue, \(r\), collected is \(r(d) = d(600-75d)\). Here is a graph that represents the function.</p>
<p><img alt="A parabola on a coordinate grid. The x-axis represents the ticket price in dollars and the y-axis represents the revenue in thousands of dollars. The x-axis scale is 1 and extends from 0 to 9. The y-axis scale is 200 and extends from 0 to 1,400." height="239" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/fee55a9caac6fdb23adee5184fe9f1a799a18de7" width="328"/></p>
<p>It makes sense that the revenue goes down after a certain point, since if the price is too high nobody will buy a ticket. From the graph, we can tell that the greatest revenue, \($1,200\), comes from selling the tickets for \($4\) each. So we know, the range of this parabola reaches a maximum value of $1,200.</p>
<p>We can also see that the domain of the function \(r\) is between \(0\) and \(8\). This makes sense because the cost of the tickets canâ€™t be negative, and if the price were more than \($8\), the model would not work, as the revenue collected cannot be negative. (A negative revenue would mean the number of tickets sold is negative, which is not possible.)</p>
