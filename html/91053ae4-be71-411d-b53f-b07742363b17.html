<h4>Revenue Represented with Quadratics</h4>
<p>Quadratic functions often come up when studying revenue. (Revenue means the money collected when someone sells something.)</p>
<p>Suppose we are selling raffle tickets and deciding how much to charge for each ticket. When the price of the tickets is higher, typically fewer tickets will be sold.</p>
<p>Each ticket has a price of \(d\) dollars, and it is possible to sell \(600-75d\) tickets. We can find the revenue by multiplying the price by the number of tickets expected to be sold. A function that models the revenue, \(r\), collected is \(r(d) = d(600-75d)\). Here is a graph that represents the function.</p>
<p><img alt="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graph of non linear function, origin O. Horizontal axis, price, dollars, from 0 to 9 by 1&rsquo;s. Vertical axis, revenue, thousands of dollars, 0 to 1400 by 200&rsquo;s. Line starts at 0 comma 0, increases until 4 comma 1200 then decreases until 8 comma 0. Passes through 2 comma 900 and 6 comma 900.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" height="239" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/fee55a9caac6fdb23adee5184fe9f1a799a18de7" width="328"></p>
<p>It makes sense that the revenue goes down after a certain point, since if the price is too high nobody will buy a ticket. From the graph, we can tell that the greatest revenue, \($1,200\), comes from selling the tickets for \($4\) each.</p>
<p>We can also see that the domain of the function \(r\) is between \(0\) and \(8\). This makes sense because the cost of the tickets can&rsquo;t be negative, and if the price were more than \($8\), the model would not work, as the revenue collected cannot be negative. (A negative revenue would mean the number of tickets sold is negative, which is not possible.)</p>

  <p>Here is how to write the function for the concert revenue:</p>
  <p>Step 1<br>
    Multiply the tickets sold by the price of each ticket, \(p\).</p>
  <p>\(p(500 - 10p)\)</p>
  <p>Step 2<br>
    Distribute the \(p\).</p>
  <p>\(500p-10p^2\)</p>
  <p>Step 3<br>
    Write as a function, \(r(p)\).</p>
  <p>\(r(p)=500p-10p^2\)</p>
