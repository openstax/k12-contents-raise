<p>Scientists and mathematicians frequently collect data from their experiments. These data sets can be analyzed to better understand a situation. In this lesson, you will use graphing technology to analyze data sets so that you can identify a curve of best fit for any given data. You will then use the curve of best fit to make accurate predictions about real-world situations.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Graph a quadratic data set using technology. </li>
  <li> Find a regression curve, or curve of best fit, using a quadratic data set. </li>
  <li> Use a regression curve to create a quadratic model for making predictions. </li>
  <li> Make predictions about a real-world situation using a quadratic data set. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
