<p>To highlight the importance of attending to units of measurement when working with statements in function notation, display for all to see the following description and list of statements.</p>
<p>At noon, a news organization published a piece of breaking news on its website. The function \(Q\) gives the number of visitors, in thousands, to the website \(h\) hours after the news was published. By 2:30 p.m., the news article had been viewed by 1.6 million visitors.</p>
<p>\(Q\)(2:30) \(=1.6\)</p>
<p>\(Q(2.5)=1.6\)</p>
<p>\(Q(2.5)=1600\)</p>
<p>\(Q\)(2:30) \(=1,600,000\)</p>
<p>\(Q(150)=1600\)</p>
<p>\(Q(2.5)=1,600,000\)</p>
<p>Give students a moment of quiet time to think individually to decide which statement in function notation correctly represents the visitor data at 2:30 p.m. Ask them to be prepared to explain why they believe all the other statements that are not selected do not accurately represent the situation.</p>
<p>Make sure students understand why \(Q(2.5)=1600\) is the only one that represents the quantities in the situation.</p>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
