<h3>Student Readiness for Unit 3</h3>
<p>To be ready for this unit, students will need to be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Distinguish linear patterns from nonlinear patterns based on scatter plots. </li>
  <li> Identify positive and negative trends in a scatter plot. </li>
  <li> Interpret slopes and \(y\)-intercepts of graphs of linear equations. </li>
</ul>
<p>This Unit Overview Video will provide a big picture look at the content found in this unit as well as the prerequisite skills that students need for accessing the content in the unit.  </p><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RDAZAv3wwH8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h3>Vertical Alignment for Unit 3</h3>
<p>What is vertical alignment? You may be familiar with aligning your math lesson to a set of standards. But what does TEA mean when they discuss the importance of vertical alignment? Vertical alignment documents the progression of learning from grade level to grade level.</p>
<p>Students learn many different sets of knowledge and skills related to mathematics that build upon each other. Understanding this progression of learning across the curriculum continuum provides teachers and administrators the ability to better support mathematical conceptual and skill-based development.</p>
<p>As a teacher, understanding the TEKS mathematical vertical alignment will help you better understand what your students have already mastered and how what you are teaching them will be critical for mastery in future learning opportunities.</p>
<p>For Algebra I teachers, we recommend using the Texas Education Agency&rsquo;s <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c1d455b65dade9bf6cba34312c3742132cb76c48" target="_blank">TEKS Vertical Alignment Chart Grades 5 through Algebra 1 and Algebra 2</a>.</p>
<h3>Pre-Algebra Resources from OpenStax</h3>
<p>As you work with individual students and find gaps in their prior learning, one source that you can pull remedial or reinforcing content from is the <a href="https://openstax.org/details/books/prealgebra-2e" target="_blank">OpenStax Pre-Algebra</a> textbook.</p>
<ul>
  <li> 11.2 Graphing Linear Equations </li>
  <li> 11.4 Understand Slope of a Line </li>
</ul>
