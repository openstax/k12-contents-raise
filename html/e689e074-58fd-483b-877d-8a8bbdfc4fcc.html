<h4>Graphing Quadratics With Points</h4>
<p>The function \(f\) given by \(f(x)=(x+1)(x-1)\) is written in factored form. Recall that this form is helpful for finding the zeros of the function (where the function has the value 0) and telling us the \(x\)-intercepts on the graph representing the function.</p>
<p>Here is a graph representing \(f\). It shows two \(x\)-intercepts at \(x=-1\) and \(x=3\).</p>

<p>If we use &ndash;1 and 3 as outputs to \(f\), what are the outputs?</p>
<ul>
<li>\(
    f(-1)=(-1+1)(-1-3)=(0)(-4)=0\) </li>
<li> \(f(3)=(3+1)(3-3)=(4)(0)=0\) </li>
</ul>
<p>Because the inputs &ndash;1 and 3 produce an output of 0, they are the zeros of the function \(f\). And because both \(x\) values have 0 for their \(y\) value, they also give us the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph (the points where the graph crosses the \(x\)-axis, which always have a \(y\)-coordinate of 0). So, the zeros of a function have the same values as the \(x\)-coordinates of the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph of the function.</p>
<p>The factored form can also help us identify the vertex of the graph, which is the point where the function reaches its minimum value. Notice that the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex is 1, and that 1 is halfway between &ndash;1 and 3. Once we know the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex, we can find the \(y\)-coordinate by evaluating the function \(f(1)=(1+1)(1-3)=(2)(-2)=-4\). So the vertex is at \((1, &ndash;4)\).</p>
<p>When a quadratic function is in standard form, the \(y\)-intercept is clear: its \(y\)-coordinate is the constant term \(c\) in \(ax^2+bx+c\). To find the \(y\)-intercept from factored form, we can evaluate the function at \(x=0\), because the \(y\)-intercept is the point where the graph has an input value of 0: </p>
<p>\(f(0)=(0+1)(0-3)=(1)(-3)=-3\)</p>

<p>Here is how to find the function&rsquo;s zeros and vertex:</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
    Set each factor equal to 0 and solve. </p>
<ul>
<li>\(
      x - 4 = 0, x = 4\) </li>
<li> \(x + 2 = 0, x = -2\) </li>
</ul>
<p>Step 2<br>
    Write the zeros as points. <br>
    \((4, 0) (-2, 0)\) </p>
<p>Step 3<br>
    Find the \(x\)-value halfway between the zeros. <br>
    \(x=1\) </p>
<p>Step 4<br>
    Substitute \(x = -1\) into the function to find the vertex. <br>
    \(f(1) = (1 - 4)(1 + 2) = (-3)(3) = -9\) <br>
    Vertex: \((1,-9)\) </p>
<p>Step 5<br>
    Now, use these points to graph \(f\): </p>
