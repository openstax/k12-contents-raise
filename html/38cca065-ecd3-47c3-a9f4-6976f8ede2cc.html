<p>John Hope Bryant, founder of Project Hope, helps underserved populations become part of the economy and work toward financial freedom. John can use exponential models to explain how interest rates on a credit card can increase even a small debt over time. Exponential models can also be used to show that interest rates on investments can increase your account over time, even if you do not add additional funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you proceed through this lesson, you will explore exponential relationships. You will learn that in an exponential relationship, the \(y\) value is multiplied by a constant factor as \(x\) increases by 1. You will learn that in an exponential growth relationship, the \(y\) values increase by a factor greater than 1. In an exponential decay relationship, the \(y\) values decrease by a factor between 0 and 1. You will make a connection between exponential situations and the graphs that represent them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
