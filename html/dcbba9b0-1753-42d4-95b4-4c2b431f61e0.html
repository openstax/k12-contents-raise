<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>Earlier in the lesson, students identified key features of a graph of a function and related them to the features of a situation. In this activity, students continue to connect graphical and verbal representations of a function, applying the mathematical terms they learned. They also connect each feature (described in words and on the graph) to an expression or equation that could represent it mathematically, written in function notation.</p>
<p>During the activity synthesis, students learn to distinguish between a maximum or minimum of a graph (relative maximum or minimum) and the maximum or minimum of a function (absolute maximum or minimum). Students see that a maximum of a graph refers to a point on a graph that is as high as or higher than all other points, while the maximum of a function is a function value that is equal to or greater than all other values of that function.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Give students a few minutes of quiet time to think individually, and then time to discuss their response with their partner.</p>
<p>As an alternative to completing this task digitally, you may wish to have students complete the task using a paper copy. For this option, it is suggested to print pages 1 and 2 of the <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/1ce33b64a2a1fc2d955cfb906b53195a98161ee8" target="_blank">Unit 4 Lesson 6 Student Activity 3</a> document on separate pages.</p>

<p>As students share their matches and explain their reasoning to their partner, display the following sentence frames for all to see: "_____ matches _____ because . . .", "I noticed _____ , so I matched . . .", and "The strategy that I used was . . . ." Encourage students to challenge each other when they disagree. While monitoring discussions, amplify student ideas to demonstrate use of mathematical language such as "first peak", "maximum", "minimum", or "vertical intercept." This routine will help students connect graphical and verbal representations of a function through partner discussions.<br/>

<h4>Student Activity </h4>
<p>In a bungee jump, the height of the jumper is a function of time since the jump begins.</p>

<p>Function h defines the height, in meters, of a jumper above a river, \(t\) seconds since leaving the platform.</p>

<p>The horizontal intercept is also called the \(x\)-intercepts or zero.</p>
<p>The vertical intercept is also called the \(y\)-intercepts.</p>
<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>Based on the information available, how long do you think the bungee cord is? Make an estimate and explain your reasoning.</p>
<h4>Extension Student Response</h4>
<p>For example: About 50 meters. The low points on the graph increase with each bounce and the high points decrease. They look like they are approaching about 30 meters in height above the river. Since the jump started from 80 meters above the river, this means that the bungee cord is about 50 meters long.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Have students pair up to share how they made their matches and how they interpreted the expression or equation without a matching verbal description. The teacher should circulate checking answers and listening for outliers.  Have students share the different responses if time or just share outliers with whole class.</p>
<p>Make sure students can interpret \(h(t)=0\) to mean that the jumper is no longer in the air and is in fact on the surface of the water. Because the graph has no horizontal intercept, and because no verbal descriptions to this effect were given, we know \(h(t)=0\) had no match.</p>
<p>Next, ask students to share their response to the last set of questions. Discuss with students why \(h(t)=0\) has no solutions based on the information we have. It is possible that, if the graph is extended to include more time, we might see a representation of the jumper somehow reaching the water. But given the graph as is, it doesn't have a solution.</p>
<p>This is a good time to introduce the distinction between a maximum (or minimum) of a graph and the maximum (or minimum) of a function. Ask students,</p>
<ul>
<li>"What is the greatest value of ?function \(h\)" (80)</li>
<li>"How do we know that 80 is the greatest, or that \(h(t)\) could not have greater values?" (The jumper could not be higher than the jumping platform.)</li>
<li>"What is the least value of function \(h\)?" (about 10, based on the graph)</li>
<li>"How do we know that 10 is the least value, or that \(h(t)\) could not have lesser values?" (We don't. The jumper could go lower, say, if lowered into a receiving boat, or if released into the river.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Explain that, in this case, the graph has one maximum, or one point that is higher than all the other points, and it coincides with the maximum of the function, which is the greatest value of the function.</p>
<p>The graph also has a minimum, \((4,h(4))\), which is lower than all other points shown on the graph, but this point does not represent the minimum of the function, or the lowest value the function could have. The function \(h\) could have 0 as its minimum (or a negative value if the jumper goes diving), but as far as the given graph is concerned, \((4,10)\) is a minimum.</p>
<p>Emphasize that a maximum (or minimum) of a graph is a point, and it gets labeled as such relative to other points visible on the graph. The maximum (or minimum) of a function, however, is a value that is the greatest (or least) for any input.</p>

<p>\(h(1)=20\), The maximum height occurred 1 second after the ball was kicked.</p>

<p>Incorrect. Let’s try again a different way: The maximum is the highest point on the graph. \(h(1)=20\) is not the highest point. The answer is \(h(2.5)=31\). The maximum of this graph is 31.</p>

<p>\(h(2.5) = 31\), The maximum height is about 2.5 feet.  It occurred about 31 seconds after the ball was kicked</p>

<p>Incorrect. Let’s try again a different way: The maximum is the highest value on the vertical axis. \(h(2.5)=31\) is the correct answer, but the 2.5 represents the time and 31 represents the height. The answer is the maximum is about 31 feet and it occurred after 2.5 seconds.</p>

<p>What does the point \(B(9)=98\) represent in the context of the problem?</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work..</p>

<p>Here is how to describe what \(B(9)=98\) represents in the context of the problem:</p>
<p>\(B(9)=98\) represents the maximum amount of money Jameson had in his account over the time period shown. It also represents that after 9 days Jameson had $98 in his account.  It is the maximum because it is the highest point on the graph provided.</p>
