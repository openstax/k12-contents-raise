<p>To help students consolidate the observations and insights from this lesson, consider asking them to describe to a partner or write down their responses to prompts such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> "How would you explain to a classmate who is absent today how to rewrite \(x^2+ 16x &minus; 36\) in factored form?" (Check to make sure the leading coefficient on the \(x^2\) term is 1. Then look for factors of the constant term, &ndash;36, that result in a sum of the linear term, +16. We know that one factor must be positive and one factor must be negative. Use these factors to convert the expression into the factored form, \((x + m)(x + n)\). Since the factors we are looking for are 18 and &ndash;2, the factored form is \((x + 18)(x &minus; 2)\). </li>
  <li>"How would you explain how to rewrite \(x^2&minus;5x &minus;24\) in factored form?" (Check to make sure the leading coefficient on the \(x^2\) term is 1. Then look for factors of the constant term, &ndash;24, that result in a sum of the linear term, &ndash;5. We know that one factor must be positive and one factor must be negative. Use these factors to convert the expression into the factored form, \((x + m)(x + n)\). Since the factors we are looking for are &ndash;8 and 3, the factored form is \((x &minus; 8)(x + 3)\). </li>
  <li>"Suppose you are rewriting the quadratic expression \(x^2+bx +c\) in factored form \((x + m)(x + n)\). How will the factors be different when the \(c\) is positive versus when \(c\) is negative?" (When \(c\) is positive, we know that the factors of \(c\) we are looking for have the same sign. When \(c\) is negative, we know that the factors of \(c\) we are looking for have opposite signs.) </li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
