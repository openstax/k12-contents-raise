<p>Describe the strength and sign of the relationship you expect for each pair of variables. Be prepared to show your reasoning.</p>
<!--Question 1 -->
<div class="os-raise-ib-input" data-button-text="Solution" data-content-id="46df6c07-25b6-4ff4-8666-3a4b2ee6c8cc" data-schema-version="1.0">
<div class="os-raise-ib-input-content">
 <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>Used car price and original sale price of the car </li>
</ol>
</div>
  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-prompt">
    <p>Enter your answer here:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-ack">
    <p>Compare your answer:</p>
    <p>
      Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. Strong, positive linear relationship since a car that cost a lot at first is probably still worth more later than a car that was less expensive when it was first bought.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!--Question 2 -->
<div class="os-raise-ib-input" data-button-text="Solution" data-content-id="0f5124c7-b555-4fd0-93df-fa8d4e2497e3" data-schema-version="1.0">
<div class="os-raise-ib-input-content">
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li>Used car price and number of cup holders in the car </li>
</ol>
</div>
  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-prompt">
    <p>Enter your answer here:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-ack">
    <p>Compare your answer:</p>
    <p>
        Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. Weak to no relationship. Although it is useful to have some cup holders, very little of a car&rsquo;s value is based on the number present in the car.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!--Question 3 -->
<div class="os-raise-ib-input" data-button-text="Solution" data-content-id="73b11e65-b81f-41d5-9eea-0310228012aa" data-schema-version="1.0">
<div class="os-raise-ib-input-content">
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
<li>Used car price and number of oil changes the car has had </li>
</ol>
</div>
  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-prompt">
    <p>Enter your answer here:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-ack">
    <p>Compare your answer:</p>
    <p>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. Strong, positive linear relationship since cars usually have their oil changed every few thousand miles or every few months, so a lot of oil changes indicates the car has either been driven very far or owned for a long time, so it is probably worth less than a car with fewer oil changes.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!--Question 4 -->
<div class="os-raise-ib-input" data-button-text="Solution" data-content-id="dc7248ea-ee07-4b19-9812-2ada2323f3be" data-schema-version="1.0">
<div class="os-raise-ib-input-content">
  <p>4.&nbsp;Used car price and number of miles the car has been driven<br></p>
</div>
  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-prompt">
    <p>Enter your answer here:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-ack">
    <p>Compare your answer:</p>
    <p>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. Strong, negative relationship since the number of miles a car has been driven usually indicates more wear on the engine and other car parts, so the car is not worth as much as a car that has been driven less.</p>
