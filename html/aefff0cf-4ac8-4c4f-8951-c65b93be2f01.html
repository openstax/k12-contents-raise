    <p>To help students consolidate their work in this lesson, discuss questions such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&ldquo;We saw equations in different forms representing the same constraint. For example, \( x+4y=28 \) and \( y=-\frac14 x+ 7 \) both represent the games and rides that a student could do with a fixed budget. What information about the situation and about the graph can we gain from the standard form, \( Ax+By=C \)?&rdquo; (In this example, the standard form allows us to see the cost per ride, the cost per game, and the budget.)</li>
      <li>&ldquo;What information does the slope-intercept form give us?&rdquo; (It gives us the slope and \( y \)-intercept of the graph. The slope tells us what is given up in terms of rides for each additional game played. The \( y \)-intercept tells us how many rides are possible when no games are played.)</li>
      <li>&ldquo;What might be an efficient way to graph an equation of the form \( Ax+By=C \)?&rdquo; (Substituting 0 for \( x \) or for \( y \) in the equation. Doing so gives us \( (x,0) \) and (\( 0,y) \), which are the horizontal and vertical intercepts of the graph. We could choose two other points, but using 0 eliminates one of the variables, simplifying the calculation. Alternatively, we could isolate \( y \) and rearrange the equation into slope-intercept form, which shows us the \( y \)-intercept and the slope.)</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
