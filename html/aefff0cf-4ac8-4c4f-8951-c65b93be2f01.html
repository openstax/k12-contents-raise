    <p>To help students consolidate their work in this lesson, discuss questions such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&ldquo;We saw equations in different forms representing the same constraint. For example, \( x+4y=28 \)> and \( y=-\frac14 x+ 7 \)> both represent the games and rides that a student could do with a fixed budget. What information about the situation and about the graph can we gain from the standard form, \( Ax+By=C \)>?&rdquo; (In this example, the standard form allows us to see the cost per ride, the cost per game, and the budget.)</li>
      <li>&ldquo;What information does the slope-intercept form give us?&rdquo; (It gives us the slope and \( y \)>-intercept of the graph. The slope tells us what is given up in terms of rides for each additional game played. The \( y \)>-intercept tells us how many rides are possible when no games are played.)</li>
      <li>&ldquo;What might be an efficient way to graph an equation of the form \( Ax+By=C \)>?&rdquo; (Substituting 0 for \( x \)> or for \( y \)> in the equation. Doing so gives us \( (x,0) \)> and (\( 0,y) \)>, which are the horizontal and vertical intercepts of the graph. We could choose two other points, but using 0 eliminates one of the variables, simplifying the calculation. Alternatively, we could isolate \( y \)> and rearrange the equation into slope-intercept form, which shows us the \( y \)>-intercept and the slope.)</li>
    </ul>
