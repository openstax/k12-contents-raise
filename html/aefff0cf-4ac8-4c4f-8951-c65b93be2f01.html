<p>To help students consolidate their work in this lesson, discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;We saw equations in different forms representing the same constraint. For example,&nbsp;<span>\( x+4y=28 \)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>\( y=-\frac14 x+ 7 \)</span>&nbsp;both represent the games and rides that a student could do with a fixed budget. What information about the situation and about the graph can we gain from the standard form,&nbsp;<span>\( Ax+By=C \)</span>?&rdquo; (In this example, the standard form allows us to see the cost per ride, the cost per game, and the budget.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;What information does the slope-intercept form give us?&rdquo; (It gives us the slope and&nbsp;<span>\( y \)</span>-intercept of the graph. The slope tells us what is given up in terms of rides for each additional game played. The&nbsp;<span>\( y \)</span>-intercept tells us how many rides are possible when no games are played.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;What might be an efficient way to graph an equation of the form&nbsp;<span>\( Ax+By=C \)</span>?&rdquo; (Substituting 0 for&nbsp;<span>\( x \)</span>&nbsp;or for&nbsp;<span>\( y \)</span>&nbsp;in the equation. Doing so gives us&nbsp;<span>\( (x,0) \)</span>&nbsp;and (<span>\( 0,y) \)</span>, which are the horizontal and vertical intercepts of the graph. We could choose two other points, but using 0 eliminates one of the variables, simplifying the calculation. Alternatively, we could isolate&nbsp;<span>\( y \)</span>&nbsp;and rearrange the equation into slope-intercept form, which shows us the&nbsp;<span>\( y \)</span>-intercept and the slope.)</li>
</ul>
