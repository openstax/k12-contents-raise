<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students will work to make a table of values from a given situation, then write an equation for each option. They then graph the equations on the same graph and discuss what the intersection means.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Ask students if they have ever belonged to a pool or if their parents belong to a gym. Maybe they have a streaming service at home. These types of memberships cost money and often people are given options with the plans that they choose. It is helpful to understand how to compare the plans and decide which one is the better deal.</p>
<p>Allow students time to read the passage to themselves, then ask them to brainstorm the questions with a partner to make predictions and support their choices. Do the partners agree or disagree?</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>This summer, the Farmer&rsquo;s Almanac is calling for very high temperatures in central Texas. Mr. and Mrs. Flores were talking about ways to keep their four children cool during the summer and also ways that the family could have fun together. They decided that this summer they would purchase a family membership to the community pool.</p>
<p>Mrs. Flores called the community pool to find out different membership plans for a family of six. The receptionist at the community center told her that there are two options. Option A is to pay $100 for the summer and $20 per visit. The second option, Option B, is to pay $250 for the summer and $5 per visit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At dinner, the Flores family talked about how many times a week they think they will visit the pool and how many times total in the summer they will visit.</p>
<p>How can the Flores family decide which option to choose? Which option do you think they will pick and why?</p>

      <p>Ask students to keep their books or devices closed and display only the image with the opening task statement, without revealing the questions that follow. Use the first read to orient students to the situation by asking students to describe what the situation is about without using numbers (a family compares two options for using the community pool). Use the second read to identify quantities and relationships; ask students: “What can be counted or measured?” Listen for, and amplify, the important quantities that vary in relation to each other in this situation: number of visits to the pool, initial cost for the membership, and total cost of each option. After the third read, reveal the questions that follow and invite students to brainstorm possible strategies to find the solution to the system. This routine helps students interpret the language within a given situation needed to create a system of equations.</p>

<p>As students talk with partners, ensure they are recognizing elements of the English sound system in newly acquired vocabulary such as long and short vowels, silent letters, and consonant clusters in words such as slope and intercept.</p>

<p>When reading the initial longer passage, monitor students as they:</p>
<ul>
  <li> read silently with increasing ease and comprehension for longer periods </li>
  <li> demonstrate English comprehension and expand reading skills by employing inferential skills such as predicting, making connections between ideas, drawing inferences and conclusions from text and graphic sources, and finding evidence </li>
</ul>
<p>For number 13, consider using a partnered-reading strategy with ELL students. Students will read their partner&rsquo;s paragraph to themselves, then have their partner read the paragraph aloud, then they will read the paragraph aloud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monitor ELL students for the following:</p>
<p>When writing their own paragraph:</p>
<ul>
  <li> use correct verbs, tenses, and pronouns/antecedents </li>
  <li> spell familiar English words with increasing accuracy, and employ English spelling patterns and rules with increasing accuracy as more English is acquired </li>
  <li> &nbsp;edit writing for standard grammar and usage, including subject-verb agreement, pronoun agreement, and appropriate verb tenses commensurate with grade-level expectations as more English is acquired </li>
</ul>
<p>When reading their partner&rsquo;s paragraph (to themselves and aloud):</p>
<ul>
  <li> recognize directionality of English reading such as left to right and top to bottom </li>
  <li> practice producing sounds of newly acquired vocabulary such as long and short vowels, silent letters, and consonant clusters to pronounce English words in a manner that is increasingly comprehensible specifically for the words slope and \(y\)-intercept </li>
  <li> distinguish sounds and intonation patterns of English with increasing ease </li>
  <li> learn relationships between sounds and letters of the English language and decode (sound out) words using a combination of skills such as recognizing sound-letter relationships and identifying cognates, affixes, roots, and base words </li>
</ul>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may need to reactivate the meaning of slope and where to find the slope in the table. When writing the equations, students often switch the slope and \(y\)-intercept values in the slope-intercept formula.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite partners to share their reasoning for numbers 12 and 13. Ask volunteers to extend each table of values to show if their reasoning is true. If time allows, consider having students write their own situations and trade with a partner. Students will then write their own table of values, graphs, and equations for the situations. This would also allow for an opportunity for partners to create presentations on their situations for their classmates.</p>

<h4>Representing a Linear Function in Tabular Form</h4>
<p>A system of equations is two or more equations. Often, each equation in a system of equations represents a situation. Like other equations, the equations that make up the system can be represented by a table. When writing any equation from a table into slope-intercept form, two things are needed: a slope and point, often the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p>Example: Suppose a maglev train travels a long distance and maintains a constant speed of 83 meters per second for a period of time once it is 250 meters from the station. Here is a table that shows this constant speed.</p>
<p><img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/12d18b5c6947fa3bed77efd98af1ee906d8bcaf6" width="550"/></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Find the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p>Notice that when \(t = 0, D(t)=250\). This is the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Find the slope.</p>
<p>To find the slope, find the change of \(y\) over the change of \(x: m=\frac{83}{1}=83\).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Write the equation in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p>\(y=mx +b\), where \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p>\(y =83x +250\)</p>

<h4>Try It: Representing a Linear Function in Tabular Form</h4>
<p>A new plant food was introduced to a young tree to test its effect on the height of the tree. The table shows the height of the tree, in feet, \(x\) months since the measurements began. Write a linear function, \(H(x)\), where \(x\) is the number of months since the start of the experiment.</p>

<br>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Here is how to write an equation from the table.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Find the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p>Notice that when \(x = 0\), \(H(x)=12.5\). This is the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 </strong>- Find the slope.</p>
<p>To find the slope, find the change of \(y\) over the change of \(x\): \(m=\frac{1}{2}=0.5\).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Write the equation in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p>\(y=mx +b\), where \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p>\(y =0.5x +12.5\)</p>
