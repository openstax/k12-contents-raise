<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>Up to this point, most quadratic expressions that students have transformed from standard form to factored form had a
  leading coefficient of 1; that is, they were in the form of \(x^2+ bx + c\) because the squared term had a coefficient
  of 1. There were a few instances in which students rewrote expressions in standard form with a leading coefficient
  other than 1. Those expressions were differences of two squares, where there were no linear terms (for instance,
  \(9x^2&minus; 64\) or \(25x^2&minus; 9\)). Students learned to rewrite these as \((3x + 8)(3x &minus; 8)\) or \((5x +
  3)(5x &minus; 3)\), respectively.</p>
<p>In this lesson, students consider how to rewrite expressions in standard form where the leading coefficient is not 1
  and the expression is not a difference of two squares. They notice that the same structure used to rewrite \(x^2+ 5x +
  4\) as \((x + 4)(x + 1)\) can be used to rewrite expressions such as \(3x^2+ 8x + 4\), but the process is now a little
  more involved because the coefficient of \(x^2\) has to be taken into account when finding the right pair of factors.
</p>
<p>This lesson aims to give students a flavor of rewriting more complicated expressions in factored form, and to suggest
  that it is not always practical or possible. This experience motivates the need for other strategies for solving
  equations and prepares students to complete the square in a series of upcoming lessons.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Write an equivalent expression in factored form given a quadratic expression of the form \(ax^2+ bx + c\), where
    \(a\) is not 1. </li>
  <li> Write a quadratic equation that represents a context, consider different methods for solving it, and describe
    (orally) the limitations of each method. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Use the factored form of a quadratic expression or a graph of a quadratic function to answer questions about a
    situation. </li>
  <li> Write equivalent expressions in factored form when given quadratic expressions of the form \(ax^2+ bx + c\) and
    \(a\) is not 1. </li>
</ul>
