<p>Mr. Das has been interested in how batteries work and how to make them last longer since he was a boy. Now he is using that interest as a PhD candidate at MIT to produce longer-lasting batteries, which can cut down the impact on the environment. He can use functions to help him analyze energy inputs and outputs as he studies battery power and efficiency.</p>
<p>In this section, you will take a closer look at the input and output of a function. You will learn to identify the domain, inputs, and range, outputs, of a function based on context and graphs.</p>
<p>This section includes 2 lessons:</p>
