<h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>
<p>In an earlier lesson, students noticed a connection between the numbers in a quadratic expression in factored form (for example, the "2" and "8" in \((X+2)(X-8)\)) and the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph. In this lesson, they explore that connection further.</p>
<p>Prior to this point, students have not looked closely at how the addition and subtraction symbols in the factors affect the \(x\)-intercepts. They also have not considered how or why the connection works, or whether it is a reliable way to determine the \(x\)-intercepts. In this lesson, they verify their observations by evaluating the expressions at certain \(x\)-values and seeing if they produce an output of 0.</p>
<p>Students also explore what the factored form can tell us about the vertex and the \(y\)-intercept of a graph representing a quadratic function.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Create graphs of quadratic functions that are in factored form. </li>
  <li> Given a quadratic function in factored form, explain how to determine the vertex and \(y\)-intercept of its graph. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Graph a quadratic function given in factored form. </li>
  <li> Find the vertex and \(y\)-intercept of the graph of a quadratic function in factored form without graphing it first. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>
<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson. Encourage students to look for these words and notice their use and meanings. </li>
  <li> Encourage students to use key vocabulary words in &ldquo;math talk&rdquo; and their written and oral explanations. </li>
  <li> Utilize a word wall. Sample cards are located here: <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/8ed3aa68763498713b44d3c2e537ffe61b4755f0" target="_blank">Mathematics Vocabulary Word Wall Cards</a>. </li>
