<h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>
<p>In an earlier lesson, students noticed a connection between the numbers in a quadratic expression in factored form (for example, the "2" and "8" in \((X+2)(X-8)\)) and the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph. In this lesson, they explore that connection further.</p>
<p>Prior to this point, students have not looked closely at how the addition and subtraction symbols in the factors affect the \(x\)-intercepts. They also have not considered how or why the connection works, or whether it is a reliable way to determine the \(x\)-intercepts. In this lesson, they verify their observations by evaluating the expressions at certain \(x\)-values and seeing if they produce an output of 0.</p>
<p>Students also explore what the factored form can tell us about the vertex and the \(y\)-intercept of a graph representing a quadratic function.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Create graphs of quadratic functions that are in factored form. </li>
  <li> Given a quadratic function in factored form, explain how to determine the vertex and \(y\)-intercept of its graph. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Graph a quadratic function given in factored form. </li>
  <li> Find the vertex and \(y\)-intercept of the graph of a quadratic function in factored form without graphing it first. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson. Encourage students to look for these words and notice their use and meanings. </li>
  <li> Encourage students to use key vocabulary words in &ldquo;math talk&rdquo; and their written and oral explanations. </li>
  <li> Utilize a word wall. Sample cards are located here: <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/8ed3aa68763498713b44d3c2e537ffe61b4755f0" target="_blank">Mathematics Vocabulary Word Wall Cards</a>. </li>

<h4> Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<div>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS.  The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.<br>&nbsp;<br>
	<ul>
	 <li> A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
		<li>A3(B) expand and internalize initial English vocabulary by learning and using high-frequency English words necessary for identifying and describing people, places, and objects, by retelling simple stories and basic information represented or supported by pictures, and by learning and using routine language needed for classroom communication</li>
		<li>A3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions </li>
		<li>A3(F) ask and give information ranging from using a very limited bank of high-frequency, high-need, concrete vocabulary, including key words and expressions needed for basic communication in academic and social contexts, to using abstract and content-based vocabulary during extended speaking assignments </li>
		<li>A3(H) narrate, describe, and explain with increasing specificity and detail as more English is acquired</li>
	</ul>
