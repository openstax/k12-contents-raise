<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students deepen their understanding of functions by comparing representations of several functions
  relating the same pair of quantities. They analyze two or more graphs simultaneously, interpreting their relative
  features and their average rates of change in context.</p>
<p>Students also study comparative statements in function notation, such as \(A(x)=B(x)\), \(B(10)&gt;A(10)\), and
  explain them in terms of changes in population, changes in the trends of phone ownership, and the popularity of
  different television shows.</p>
<p>Students pay close attention to the intersection of two graphs in this lesson. Earlier in their study, they learned
  that a solution to a system of linear equations in two variables is a point where the graphs of the equations in the
  system intersect. Here, students recognize equations of the form \(f(x)=g(x)\) to mean functions \(f\) and \(g\)
  having the same output value at the same input value. They see that a solution to such an equation is the
  \(x\)-coordinate of a point where the graphs of \(f\) and \(g\) intersect.</p>
<p>Making comparisons involves looking beyond individual pieces of information. To accurately relate the information
  from multiple representations requires careful and precise use of mathematical language and notation. Students
  continue reasoning abstractly and quantitatively as they use their analyses of representations of functions to draw
  conclusions about the quantities in situations.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compare key features of graphs of functions and interpret them in context.</li>
  <li>Find the solutions and meanings of \(f(x)=g(x)\) in terms of a situation and a graph.</li>
  <li>Interpret statements about two or more functions written in function notation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Compare the features of graphs of functions and explain what they mean in the situations represented.</li>
  <li>Make sense of an equation of the form \(f(x)=g(x)\) in terms of a situation and a graph, and know how to find the
    solutions.</li>
  <li>Explain statements about two or more functions when they are written in function notation.</li>
