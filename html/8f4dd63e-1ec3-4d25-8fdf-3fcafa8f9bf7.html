<p>Students have looked at the zeros and domains of functions in different situations. They have also thought about what the vertices of the graphs of functions mean in the given contexts. To help students consolidate the key ideas in this lesson, consider asking them to complete one or more of the following sentence stems:</p>
<ul>
<li>
    In general, the zeros of a function tell us . . . For example: . . .
  </li>
<li>
    In general, the vertex of a graph that represents a function tells us . . . For example: . . .
  </li>
<li>
    To determine an appropriate domain for a function, we need to consider . . .
  </li>
</ul>
