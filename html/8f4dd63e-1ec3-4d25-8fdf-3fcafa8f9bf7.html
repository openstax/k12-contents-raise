<p>Students have looked at the zeros and domains of functions in different situations. They have also thought about what the vertices of the graphs of functions mean in the given contexts. To help students consolidate the key ideas in this lesson, consider asking them to complete one or more of the following sentence stems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    In general, the zeros of a function tell us . . . For example: . . .
  </li>
  <li>
    In general, the vertex of a graph that represents a function tells us . . . For example: . . .
  </li>
  <li>
    To determine an appropriate domain for a function, we need to consider . . .
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
