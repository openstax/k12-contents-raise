<h4> Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>This lesson introduces a method for factoring trinomials of the form \(x^2 + bx + c\). By undoing FOIL, students can
  reverse the process used to multiply binomials and find the factored form of the trinomials.</p>
<p>This lesson also introduces multiple ways to factor trinomials of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\). The simplest way is to
  factor out the GCF and determine what simplifies the form of the trinomial. If the form is still \(ax^2 + bx + c\),
  then students may choose from trial and error and the &ldquo;\(ac\)&rdquo; method. The &ldquo;\(ac\)&rdquo; method
  will work for any trinomial of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\).</p>
<p>If a polynomial does not seem to fit the known forms for factoring, it may be possible to substitute the variable
  \(u\) for an expression, thus simplifying the trinomial into a more recognizable form. The trinomial can then be
  factored, and the original expression is then substituted back in for \(u\).</p>

      f</em>or a value before factoring. </li>
