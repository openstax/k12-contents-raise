<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>Earlier in the unit, students solved systems of linear equations in two variables. They also found solutions to linear inequalities in two variables. In this lesson, students build on those understandings to find the solutions to systems of linear inequalities in two variables.</p>
<p>Students learn that two linear inequalities that represent the constraints in the same situation form a system of inequalities, and that the solutions to the system include all numbers that satisfy both constraints simultaneously. Graphically, the solution set of the system is represented by the region where the graphs of the individual inequalities overlap.</p>
<p>Throughout the lesson, students endeavor to find values that satisfy multiple constraints, in both mathematical and real-world contexts. The process requires that students make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:<br></p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify values that satisfy each constraint and those that satisfy both constraints simultaneously, given descriptions and graphs that represent two constraints.</li>
  <li>Explain that the solution set of a system of inequalities in two variables is comprised of any pair of values that make both inequalities true, and that it is represented graphically by the region where the graphs overlap.</li>
  <li>Write systems of inequalities in two variables, use technology to graph the solutions, and interpret the solutions in context.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Write a system of inequalities to describe a situation, find the solution by graphing, and interpret points in the solution.</li>
  <li>Explain what is meant by &ldquo;the solutions to a system of inequalities&rdquo; and describe the graphs that represent the solutions.</li>
  <li>Find values that satisfy each constraint individually, and values that satisfy both constraints at once, when given descriptions and graphs that represent two different constraints.</li>
</ul>
