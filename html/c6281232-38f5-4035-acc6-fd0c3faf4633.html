<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>Previously, students interpreted rules of functions only in terms of the operations performed on the input to lead to the output. In this activity, students analyze functions that relate two quantities in a situation and work to define the relationship between the quantities with a rule. They do so by creating a table of values and generalizing the process of finding one quantity given the other. Students also plot the values in each table to see the graphical representation of the functions.</p>
<p>The mathematical reasoning here is not new. Students have done similar work earlier in the course, when investigating expressions and equations. What is new is seeing these relationships as functions and using function notation to describe them.</p>
<p>Students are likely to graph the functions by plotting the values in the tables and then connecting the points with a curve. As students work on the second set of questions about a perimeter function, which is linear, look for those who relate \(P(l)=2l+6\) to a linear equation, namely \(y=2x+6\), and then graph a line with a vertical intercept of \((0,6)\) and a slope of 2. Invite them to share their thoughts during the whole-class discussion.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Give students a few minutes of quiet time to work on the first set of questions, and then a moment to discuss their responses with their partner. Then, pause for a brief discussion before students proceed to the second set of questions.</p>
<p>Invite students to share their rule for the area function. Some students may have written \(A=s^2\), while others may have written \(A(s)=s^2\). Ask students who wrote each way to explain their reasoning. Highlight explanations that point out that \(A\) is the name of the function and that function notation requires specifying the input, which is \(s\).</p>
<p>Clarify that in the past, we may have used a variable like \(A\) to represent the area, but in this case, \(A\) is used to name a function to help us talk about its input and output. If we wish to also use a variable to represent the output of this function (instead of using function notation), it would be helpful to use a different letter.</p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>If students struggle to graph the functions, suggest that they use the coordinate pairs in the tables to help them.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students to share the rule they wrote for the perimeter function (from the second set of questions) and how they determined the rule. Students may have written expressions of different forms for \(P(l)\):</p>
<p>\(l+l+3+3\)</p>
<p>\(2l+2(3)\)</p>
<p>\(2(l+3)\)</p>
<p>\(6+2l\)</p>
<p>Record and display the variations for all to see and discuss whether they all give the value of \(P(l)\). Ask students to explain how they know these expressions are equivalent and define the same function.</p>
<p>Next, discuss how students sketched the graph of the function. If no students made a connection between the slope and vertical intercept of the graph of \(P\) to the parameters in their equation, ask them about it. For example, display the graph of \(P\) and ask students to use it to write an equation for the line.</p>
