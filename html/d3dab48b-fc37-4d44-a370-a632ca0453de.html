<p>Find the approximate domain of the graph below:</p><p><img alt="Graph of the quadratic function. h(t)=5+60t&minus;16t^2 on a coordinate plane, origin O. Horizontal axis scale 0 to 4 by 1&rsquo;s, labeled &ldquo;time (seconds)&rdquo;. Vertical axis scale 0 to 80 by 20&rsquo;s, labeled &ldquo;distance above ground (feet)&rdquo;. Some of the points of this function are (0 comma 5), (1 comma 49), to a maximum near (1 point 9 comma 61 point 2 5) then decreasing through (2 comma 61), (3 comma 41) and (3.8 comma 0).
