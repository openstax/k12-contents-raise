<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In the previous two lessons, students analyzed quadratic functions that modeled projectile motion. In this lesson, they encounter a quadratic relationship in an economic context. They use a table of values to study the relationship between price and revenue, write an equation to define the function, and consider what the graph of the function tells us about the situation being modeled. In building a quadratic function to solve a pricing problem, students engage in aspects of modeling.</p>
<p>Students also deepen their understanding of the zeros and the domain of a quadratic function, and of the vertex of its graph. They interpret these features in various contexts, reasoning concretely and abstractly.</p>
<p>Technology isn&rsquo;t required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems. Consider making technology available, in case requested.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Choose an appropriate domain for a quadratic function representing a context and explain (orally) the reasoning why it was selected. </li>
  <li> Interpret (orally and in writing) the vertex of a graph and the zeros of a quadratic function in context. </li>
  <li> Write and graph equations to model economic situations characterized by quadratic functions. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Choose a domain that makes sense in a revenue situation. </li>
  <li> Model revenue with quadratic functions and graphs. </li>
  <li> Relate the vertex of a graph and the zeros of a function to a revenue situation. </li>
</ul>

<h4> Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<div>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS.  The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.<br>&nbsp;<br>
	<ul>
		<li>ELPS 1(C) use strategic learning techniques such as concept mapping, drawing, memorizing, comparing, contrasting, and reviewing to acquire basic and grade-level vocabulary </li>
		<li>ELPS 1(F) use accessible language and learn new and essential language in the process</li>
		<li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
		<li>ELPS 3(B) expand and internalize initial English vocabulary by learning and using high-frequency English words necessary for identifying and describing people, places, and objects, by retelling simple stories and basic information represented or supported by pictures, and by learning and using routine language needed for classroom communication </li>
		<li>ELPS 3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions </li>
		<li>ELPS 3(H) narrate, describe, and explain with increasing specificity and detail as more English is acquired</li>
		<li>ELPS 5(B) write using newly acquired basic vocabulary and content-based grade-level vocabulary</li>
	</ul>
