<p>In this course, students have looked at many examples of exponential functions and linear functions. They have studied their graphs, equations, and tables of values. Help students review the features and behaviors of the two kinds of functions by presenting these pairs of functions (all of which represent growth):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Two linear functions&nbsp;\(f\)&nbsp;and<i>&nbsp;</i>\(g\), for example: \(f(x)=\frac{1}{2}x+100\) and \(g(x)=2x\) </li>
  <li>Two exponential functions \(p\) and&nbsp;\(q\), for example: \(p(x)=100 \cdot (1.5)^x\) and \(q(x)=5 \cdot2^x\) </li>
  <li>A linear function&nbsp;\(m\)&nbsp;and an exponential function  \(n\), for example: \(m(x)=300x+1,000\) and \(n(x)=(0.4) \cdot 2^x\) </li>
</ul>
<p>For each pair for functions, ask students these questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;How can we tell which one grows more quickly?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Will the one that started out with the lower initial value catch up with the function that starts with a higher initial value?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;What are some ways to check if one function will overtake another?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Reiterate that even though an exponential function might seem to be growing too slowly to catch up to a linear function with large numbers for its \(y\)-intercept and slope, at some value of&nbsp;\(x\)&nbsp;down the line, the exponential function will catch up with the linear function. Remind students how this was the case in the genie activity early in the unit. (The starting value for the linear function was 100,000 times that of the exponential function, and the slope of the linear function was 2,000, while the growth factor of the exponential function was 2. But within 3 weeks, the exponential function surpassed the linear.)</p>
