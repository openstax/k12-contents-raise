<p>Situations such as the paths of pumpkins catapulted in the Punkin Chunkin can be represented by quadratic functions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this section, you will build quadratic functions from patterns and look at the differences between quadratic and exponential functions with tables and graphs. You will begin to build quadratic functions that describe free-falling situations and situations that involve gravity and motion and use these functions to solve problems. You will explore problems including arrows, fireworks, and cannonballs whose paths are represented by quadratic functions.</p>
<p>This section includes five lessons:</p>
<ul>
