<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>A parent is using a garden hose to fill up a small inflatable pool for her young child. The pool has a capacity of 90 gallons. She turns the water off after 5 minutes, but she leaves the hose in the pool for another 3 minutes before putting it away.</p>
<p>In this situation, the relationship between the gallons of water in the pool and the time, in minutes, since the parent started filling the pool can be seen as a function.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>In that function, which variable is independent? </li>
  <p> <strong>Answer: </strong>The time is independent.</p></ol>
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
    <li>In that function, which variable is dependent?</li>
    <p> <strong>Answer: </strong> The amount of water is dependent.</p>
    
  <li>Write a sentence of the form &ldquo;___ is a function of ___.&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>
  <p> <strong>Answer: </strong>The amount of water, in gallons, is a function of time, in minutes, since water started filling the pool.</p>
  <li>Sketch a possible graph of the relationship on the coordinate plane. Be sure to label and indicate a scale on each axis.</li>
  <p> <strong>Answer: </strong>See sample graph.</p>

<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
