<p>In this lesson, you will learn that if we rearrange and rewrite the expression on one side of a quadratic equation to be a perfect square (that is, if we complete the square) we can find the solutions of the equation.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Explain what it means to "complete the square" and describe how to do it. </li>
  <li> Solve quadratic equations by completing the square and finding square roots. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
