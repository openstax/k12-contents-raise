  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
    <li> Choose the equation that represents the total cost,c, if she buys n t-shirts.</li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>\(c = 12.5n-10\)</li>
    <li>\(c = 10n-12.5\)</li>

  <ul>
    <li>If 12 cars go, then 2 vans are needed.</li>
    <li>\(c=14\) and \(v=4\) is a pair of solutions to the equation.</li>

  </ul>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> c=14 and v=4 is a pair of solutions to the equation. If 6 cars go and 11 vans go, there
    will be extra space. If 20 cars go, no vans are needed. 8 vans and 8 cars are numbers that meet the constraints in
    this situation.
