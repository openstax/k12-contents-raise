<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6"><li> T-shirts are on sale for $12.50. Isla has a coupon for $10.00 off. </li></ol>
<p>a. Choose the equation that represents the total cost,c, if she buys n t-shirts.<br><br></p>
<ul>
<li>\(c = 12.5n-10\)</li>
<li>\(c = 10n-12.5\)</li>
<li>\(c = 12.5(n-10)\)</li>
<li>\(c = 12.5(10n)\)</li>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="8"><li> Diego is collecting dimes and nickels in a jar. He has collected $22.25 so far. The relationship between the numbers of dimes and nickels and the amount of money in dollars is represented by the equation \(0.10d+0.05n=22.25\). <strong>Select all</strong> the values \((d, n)\) that could be solutions to the equation.</li></ol>

<p>A: \((0, 445)\)</p>
<p>B: \((0.50, 435)\)</p>
<p>C: \((233, 21)\)</p>
<p>D: \((118, 209)\)</p>
<p>E: \((172, 101)\)</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &nbsp;\((0, 445)\),&nbsp;\((118, 209)\),&nbsp;\((172, 101)\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="9"><li> Volunteer drivers are needed to bring 80 students to the championship baseball game. Drivers either have cars, which can seat 4 students, or vans, which can seat 6 students. The equation \(4c+6v=80\) describes the relationship between the number of cars, \(c\), and number of vans, \(v\), that can transport exactly 80 students. <strong>Select all</strong> statements that are true about the situation.</li></ol>

<p>A:&nbsp; If 12 cars go, then 2 vans are needed.</p>
<p>B:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\(c=14\) and \(v=4\) is a pair of solutions to the equation.</p>
<p>C:&nbsp; If 6 cars go and 11 vans go, there will be extra space.</p>
<p>D: 10 cars and 8 vans isn&rsquo;t enough to transport all the students.</p>
<p>E: If 20 cars go, no vans are needed.</p>
<p>F: 8 vans and 8 cars are numbers that meet the constraints in this situation.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> B, C, E, F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\(c=14\) and \(v=4\)and&nbsp; are
a pair of solutions to the equation, If 6 cars go and 11
vans go, there will be extra space, If 20 cars go, no
vans are needed, 8 vans and 8 cars are numbers that meet
the constraints in this situation<br><br></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="10"><li> The drama club is printing T-shirts for its members. The printing company charges a certain amount for each T-shirt plus a setup fee of $40. There are 21 students in the drama club.</li></ol>
