<p>The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) encourages math teachers to not leave out the gifted students when they differentiate in the classroom. It is easy to assign more work or encourage students to help others who may be struggling. However, to fully benefit the gifted student, ensure that they are assigned open-ended, rich-inquiry activities instead of simply assigning more work or always using peer-tutoring and mentoring relationships. Differentiating is NOT adjusting the workload assigned based on ability levels or grading differently based on perceptions of students' capabilities (NCTM).</p>
<div class="os-raise-graybox">
  <p>A gifted student:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Exhibits high-performance capability in an intellectual, creative, or artistic area; </li>
    <li> Possesses an unusual capacity for leadership; or </li>
    <li> Excels in a specific academic field. (Texas Education Code §29.121) </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>The OpenStax Algebra 1 curriculum enables students to extend the regular curriculum through differentiated instructional strategies such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> New topics and ideas </li>
  <li> Creative and critical thinking skills </li>
  <li> Problem solving </li>
  <li> Opportunities for inquiry </li>
  <li> Independent study in student chosen topics </li>
  <li> Advanced research methods. (Reis and Renzulli, 2018) </li>
</ul>
<p>When you begin to use enrichment strategies in your Algebra classroom, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Which enrichment strategies and activities meet the individual students in the class? </li>
  <li> Will the Algebra 1 content be differentiated through extension and enrichment? </li>
  <li> Will you replace the Algebra 1 foundational and introductory lessons with outsourced advanced content? </li>
  <li> How will you give students the opportunity to integrate personal interests into projects and assignments (Reis and Renzulli, 2018)? </li>
</ol>
<p>In our section on differentiated learning, we shared how you can differentiate on content, product, or process. These same areas can be implemented in the Algebra I classroom to differentiate for gifted students.</p>

        <p>In this lesson, students use the main function types they have studied thus far in the course (linear and exponential) to model different populations.</p>
        <ol>
          <li> Data for three city populations are given and students are asked to produce a linear or exponential model for each (if appropriate) and then make predictions for populations at other dates. The cities have been chosen so that one is well modeled by an exponential model, another by a linear model, and the third by neither. </li>
          <li> Students examine world population. The task is more open-ended and only limited data is provided, likely requiring students to gather more data. In addition, the world population is not consistently well modeled by a linear or exponential function. However, for certain periods of time, exponential and/or linear functions can be appropriate. In particular, in recent years the growth has been strikingly linear. </li>

Also, they will be given the area of rectangles and asked to find the dimensions. This will require division of polynomials or factoring. </li>
