<p>The dashed line is the better fit for the data since it goes through the middle of the data with a slope that follows the trend of the data. 
      The solid line has a lot of points above the line to start and a lot of points below the line at the end.

<p> The dashed line is the better fit for the data since it goes through the middle of the data, follows the trend of the data, and has a similar number of points on each side that are not far from the line.
       The solid line fits the first and last point perfectly, but most of the data are above the line.</p>
