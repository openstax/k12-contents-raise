<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students examine the meaning of negative exponents in context. In these cases, time \(t\) is the
  independent variable, and \(t=0\) corresponds to a particular moment when a quantity is first measured. In these
  situations, a value of \(t\) that is less than 0 corresponds to a time before the initial measurement, while a value
  of \(t\) that is greater than 0 refers to a time after the measurement. Students write equations given a table, and
  then they use those equations to answer questions, which requires working with negative values representing time. In
  one case, students also produce a graph. As with many other activities in this unit, the mathematical work is grounded
  and interpreted in a context.</p>
<p>Students learn to convert fluently between decimal form and scientific notation. They will solve problems in context
  involving numbers in decimal form and scientific notation. They will combine what they have learned using negative
  exponents to find the solution to a real-world problem in scientific notation.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Interpret a negative exponent in equations that represent exponential growth and decay. </li>
  <li> Derive equations that represent exponential growth and decay in real-world problems. </li>
  <li> Select a proper window while graphing an equation they derived from a real-world problem involving exponential
    decay. </li>
  <li> Fluently convert between decimal form and scientific notation. </li>
  <li> Apply measurements in scientific notation and decimal form to solve a problem in a real-world situation. </li>
</ul>
