<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students examine the meaning of negative exponents in context. In these cases, time \(t\) is the independent variable, and \(t=0\) corresponds to a particular moment when a quantity is first measured. In these situations, a value of \(t\) that is less than 0 corresponds to a time before the initial measurement, while a value of \(t\) that is greater than 0 refers to a time after the measurement. Students write equations given a table, and then they use those equations to answer questions, which requires working with negative values representing time. In one case, students also produce a graph. As with many other activities in this unit, the mathematical work is grounded and interpreted in a context.</p>
<p>Students learn to convert fluently between decimal form and scientific notation. They will solve problems in context involving numbers in decimal form and scientific notation. They will combine what they have learned using negative exponents to find the solution to a real-world problem in scientific notation.</p>
