<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity reinforces the meaning of perfect squares and the fact that a perfect square can appear in different forms. To recognize a perfect square, students need to look for and make use of structure.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Encourage and support opportunities for peer interactions. Invite students to talk about their ideas with a partner before writing them down.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li><strong>Select three</strong> expressions that are perfect squares.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li> \((x+5)(5+x)\) </li>
  <li> \((x+5)(x&minus;5)\) </li>
  <li> \((x&minus;3)^2\) </li>
  <li> \(x&minus;3^2\) </li>
  <li> \(x^2+8x+16\) </li>
  <li> \(x^2+10x+20\) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \((x+5)(5+x)\), \((x&minus;3)^2\), \(x^2+8x+16\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Explain how you know the expressions you selected are perfect squares.</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Because each of them is the product of an expression and itself. \(x^2+8x+16\) is equivalent to \((x+4)(x+4)\).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Display the expressions for all to see. Invite students to share their responses and record them for all to see. For each expression that they consider a perfect square, ask them to explain how they know. For expressions that students believe aren't perfect squares, ask them to explain why not. </li>
  <li> For the last expression, \(x^2+10x+20\), students may reason that it is not a perfect square because: </li>
  <ul>
    <li> The constant term 20 is not a perfect square. (Most students are likely to reason this way.) </li>
    <li> If 20 is seen as \((\sqrt{20})^2\), then the coefficient of the linear term would have to be \(2\sqrt{20}\), not 10. </li>
    <li> Though students have been dealing mostly with rational numbers, the second line of reasoning is also valid and acceptable. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> Invite students to offer other expressions that are perfect squares. </li>
</ul>
