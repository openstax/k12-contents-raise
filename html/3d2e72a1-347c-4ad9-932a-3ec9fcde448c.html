<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>The purpose of this warm up is to elicit the idea that looking at two graphs simultaneously can yield information about solutions that satisfy both constraints in a situation simultaneously, which will be useful when students solve systems of equations graphically in their Algebra 1 class. While students may notice and wonder many things about these images, intersection points and solutions are the important discussion points.</p>
<p>Through articulating things they notice and things they wonder about the point of intersection and what it means in the situation, students have an opportunity to attend to precision in the language they use to describe what they see. They might first propose less formal or imprecise language, and then restate their observation with more precise language in order to communicate more clearly.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Students will begin with a graph of the systems of equations and write the system from the graph. Facilitate a discussion about how to find slope and \(y\)-intercept from a graph. Have students share and compare their answers. </p>
<p> For Part II, put students in pairs. After students discuss with their partner, have a whole class discussion about working backward from a given system of equations to graph the system by hand. As a class, write the steps on the board. When graphing the equations, students may want to graph each equation with a different color on their coordinate plane. This is not a time to utilize technology as the goal is for students to graph by hand.  </p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Now that you have written equations from tables, it is time to write equations of systems of equations from graphs.</p>

<h5>Writing a System of Equations from a Given Graph</h5>
<p>For questions 1–8, use the given graph:</p>

  <p>A club is selling snacks at a track meet. Oranges cost $1 each and protein bars cost $4 each. They sell a total of 100 items, and collect $304.</p>

  <li>What do you notice?&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Things students may notice:</p>
<ul>
  <li> There are two lines. </li>
  <li> It&rsquo;s about snacks. </li>
  <li> The lines intersect. </li>
  <li> The point of intersection is labeled \((32, 68)\). </li>
  <li> The sum of 32 and 68 is 100. </li>
</ul>

<li>What do you wonder?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Things students may wonder:</p>
<ul>
  <li> What does each line mean? </li>
  <li> What does the point of intersection mean? </li>
  <li> Where can you see the information from the problem on the graph? </li>
</ul>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
<li>What is the approximate \(y\)–intercept of the green dashed line?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Answers may vary: 78</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
<li>What is the approximate slope of the green dashed line?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Answers may vary: \(\frac25 \)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
<li>What is the approximate \(y\)-intercept of the orange solid line?
  Answer: Answers may vary: 100</li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
<li>What is the approximate slope of the orange solid line?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Answers may vary: \(\frac{20}{25}\) or \(\frac45\)&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Ask students to share the things they noticed and wondered. Record and display their responses for all to see. If possible, record the relevant reasoning on or near the image. After all responses have been recorded without commentary or editing, ask students, &ldquo;Is there anything on this list that you are wondering about?&rdquo; Encourage students to respectfully disagree, ask for clarification, or point out contradicting information. If the meaning of the point of intersection does not come up during the conversation, ask students to discuss this idea.</p>
<p>Solicit a discussion asking students what the point of intersection means in the context of the problem. Consider the labels of the \(x\)- and \(y\)-axes. What do the lines mean in the context of the problem? Connect the lines and intersection to the possible ways that oranges and protein bars can be sold to make $304.</p>
