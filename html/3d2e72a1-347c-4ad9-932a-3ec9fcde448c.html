<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity prompts students to write a system of equations from a graph, then reverse their steps to graph a system of equations by hand. Students will need to identify the slope and \(y\)-intercept from both the graph and an equation in \(y\)-intercept form. They will also need to recall that slope is the change in \(y\) over the change in \(x\). Finally, they will recognize that a solution to a system of equations is where the equations intersect on the graph.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Students will begin with a graph of the systems of equations and write the system from the graph. Facilitate a discussion about how to find slope and \(y\)-intercept from a graph. Have students share and compare their answers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Part II, put students in pairs. After students discuss with their partner, have a whole class discussion about working backward from a given system of equations to graph the system by hand. As a class, write the steps on the board. When graphing the equations, students may want to graph each equation with a different color on their coordinate plane. This is not a time to utilize technology as the goal is for students to graph by hand.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Now that you have written equations from tables, it is time to write systems of equations from graphs.</p>

<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>Graph the following system of equations on a coordinate plane:</p>
<p>\(y=2x +5\)</p>
<p>\(4x-2y =10\)</p>
<p>Find the solution.</p>
<p>(Hint: For the second equation, solve for \(y\) first.)</p>
<p>(Students were provided access to Desmos.)</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Infinitely many solutions</p>
<p>When the second equation is solved for \(y\), it becomes \(-2y =-4x=10\) then \(y = 2x +5\). <br>
  Both equations are the same. <br>
  So, on the graph, one line is on top of the other and all solutions are possible.</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may still have trouble mixing up the slope and \(y\)-intercept in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p>Additionally, when finding the slope, students may mix up the rise and run. Encourage students to draw on their graphs to emphasize the rise and run. In the extension, students may need to visually see that the lines are the same (or sitting on top of each other) and that multiple points are solutions to both equations.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Encourage students to check their solutions to each system of equations into both of the equations to show that the solution works in both equations.</p>

<h4>Solving Systems by Graphing</h4>
<p>The graph of a linear equation is a line. Each point on the line is a solution to the equation. For a system of two equations, we will graph two lines. Then we can see all the points that are solutions to each equation. And, by finding what the lines have in common, we&rsquo;ll find the solution to the system.</p>
<p>Most linear equations in one variable have one solution, but we saw that some equations, called contradictions, have no solutions and for other equations, called identities, all numbers are solutions.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Find the slope and \(y\)-intercept of the \(\mathrm{\style{color:red}r}\mathrm{\style{color:red}e}\mathrm{\style{color:red}d}\) \(\mathrm{\style{color:red}d}\mathrm{\style{color:red}o}\mathrm{\style{color:red}t}\mathrm{\style{color:red}t}\mathrm{\style{color:red}e}\mathrm{\style{color:red}d}\) line.</p>
<p>\(m =\frac {(y_1-y_2)}{(x_1-x_2)}=\frac {(0-(-3))}{(6-0)}=\frac36=\frac12\)</p>

<p><strong>Part 2: Use a Graph to Solve a Given System</strong></p>

<br>
<div class="os-raise-graybox">
  <p>How to solve a system of linear equations by graphing.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Find the slope and \(y\)-intercept of the first equation.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Find the slope and \(y\)-intercept of the second equation.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Graph the two equations on the same rectangular coordinate system.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Estimate the solution to the system.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>If the lines intersect, estimate the point of intersection. Check to make sure it is a solution to both equations. This is the solution to the system.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the lines are parallel, the system has no solution.</li>
  <li>If the lines are the same, the system has an infinite number of solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Solve the system by graphing:&nbsp;</p>
<p>\(y = 2x+1\)</p>
<p>\(y =4x-1\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Find the slope and \(y\)-intercept of the first equation.</p>
<p>In \(y=2x+1\), \(m=2\), \(b=1\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 </strong>- Find the slope and \(y\)-intercept of the second equation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In \(y=4x-1\), \(m=4\), \(b= -1\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 </strong>- Graph the two equations on the same rectangular coordinate system.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4 </strong>- Estimate the solution to the system.</p>
<p>The point where the lines intersect is:</p>
<p>\((1, 3)\)</p>
<p>Check to make sure the estimated point, \((1, 3)\) solves the system by substituting the values for \(x\) and \(y\) into both equations. </p>

<p>Check the first equation: \(𝑦=2𝑥+1\)</p>
<p>\(x = 1\)</p>
<p>\(y = 3\)</p>


  <p>\(y = 2x + 1\)</p>
 <p> \((3) = 2(1) + 1\)</p>
  <p>\(3 = 2 + 1\)</p>
  <p>\(3 = 3\)</p>
  <p>So, \((1, 3)\) solves \(y = 2x + 1\)</p>



<p>Check the second equation: \(𝑦=4𝑥−1\)</p>
<p>\(y = 4x - 1\)</p>
<p>\((3) = 4(1) - 1\)</p>
<p>\(3 = 4 - 1\)</p>
<p>\(3 = 3\)</p>
<p>So, \((1, 3)\) solves \(y = 4x - 1\)</p>
