<h4>Solve a Formula for a Specific Variable</h4>

<p>We have all probably
  worked with some geometric formulas in our study of mathematics.
  Formulas are used in many fields, so it is important to recognize
  formulas and be able to manipulate them easily.</p>
<p>It is often helpful to
  solve a formula for a specific variable. If you need to put a formula
  in a spreadsheet, it is not unusual to have to solve it for a specific
  variable first. We isolate that variable on one side of the equal sign
  with a coefficient of 1, and all other variables and constants are on
  the other side of the equal sign.</p>
<p>Geometric formulas
  often need to be solved for another variable, too. The formula \( V=
  \frac{1}{3} &pi;r^2h \) is used to find the volume of a right circular
  cone when given the radius of the base and height. In the next example,
  we will solve this formula for the height.</p>
<p>Example 1</p>
<p>Solve \(V=\frac{1}{3}Ï€r^2h\) for \(h\).</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Remove the fraction on the right.<br>
  Multiply both sides by 3.<br>

</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Simplify.<br>

</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Divide both sides by \( &pi;r^2 \).<br>

</p>
<p>We could now use this formula
  to find the height of a right circular cone when we know the volume and
  the radius of the base, by using the formula \( h= \frac{3V}{&pi;r^2} \)</p>
<p>In the sciences, we often need to change temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius or vice versa. If you travel in a
  foreign country, you may want to change the Celsius temperature to the more familiar Fahrenheit temperature.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Solve&nbsp;</p>
<p>\( C = \frac{5}{9} ( F - 32 ) \) for \( F \).</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Remove the fraction on the right.<br>
  Multiply both sides by 9/5.<br>

</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add 32 to both sides.<br>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>
<p>Solve the formula \( 8x + 7y = 15 \) for \( y \).</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Subtract 8x from both sides to isolate the term with \(y\).<br>

</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Divide both sides by 7 to make the coefficient of \(y\) equal to 1.<br>

</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Simplify.</p>
<p>Insert original equation</p>
<p>Now, try to solve \(d =\frac{1}{2} (v_0 + v)^t\) for \(v_0\).</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Remove the fraction on the right.<br>
  Multiply by 2.<br>
  \(2 \times d =2 \times \frac{1}{2} (v_0+ v)t\) </p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Simplify.<br>
  \(2d =(v_0+ v)t\) </p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Divide both sides by \(t\).<br>
  \(\frac{2d}{t}=\frac{(v_0+ v)^t}{t}\) </p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Simplify.<br>
  \(\frac{2d}{t}=(v_0+ v)\) </p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Subtract \(v\) from both sides to solve for v0.<br>
  \(\frac{2d}{t}-v=v_0+ v-v\) <br>
  \(\frac{2d}{t}-v=v_0\) </p>
