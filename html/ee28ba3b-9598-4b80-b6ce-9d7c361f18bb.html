<h3>Cool Down (10 minutes)</h3>
<br>

    <h4>Launch</h4>
    <p>The Cool Down activity can be completed using the questions below. As an alternative, a Desmos activity has also been provided using the same questions.</p>

    <p>Desmos activities are different from the graphing calculator application because they lead students through one or more interactive tasks. As students progress through the activity, teachers may use the Teacher Dashboard to monitor student responses and use them for whole group discussion. Activities may also be set to identify student responses that are correct or incorrect.</p>

<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
