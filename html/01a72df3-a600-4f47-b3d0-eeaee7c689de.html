      <div class="body">
        <p>In this activity, students write equations to represent quantities and relationships in two situations. In each situation, students express the same relationship multiple times: initially using numbers and <span><span>variables</span></span> and later using only variables. The progression helps students see that quantities can be known or unknown, and they can stay the same or vary, but both kinds of quantities can be expressed with numbers or letters.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Launch</h3>
      <p>Let students know that they will now begin exploring a variety of different scenarios beyond Geometry. Each scenario will have the theme of representing quantities and relationships with expressions and equations.<br></p>

      <h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>Students may translate &ldquo;Mai earned <span class="math math-repaired">\( m \)</span> dollars, which is 45 more dollars than Noah did&rdquo; as <span class="math math-repaired">\( m + 45 = v \)</span>, not paying attention to where the plus sign should go. As with other problems throughout this unit, encourage students to try using numbers in their equation to see if the equation really says what they want it to say.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>Focus the discussion on students&rsquo; observations about how the two sets of equations are alike. Then, ask how the equations within each set are different. If students mention that some quantities are known or are fixed and others are not, ask them to specify which ones are which.</p>
        <p>Highlight the idea that sometimes we know how quantities are related, but the value of each quantity may be unknown or may change. We often use letters to represent those unknown or changing quantities. </p>
        <p>There might be times, however, when we use letters to represent quantities that are known or are constant. Doing so may help us focus on the relationship rather than the numbers. Tell students we will look at examples of such situations in upcoming activities.</p>
