<h3>Activity (10 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students write equations to represent quantities and relationships in two situations. In each
  situation, students express the same relationship multiple times: initially using numbers and variables and later
  using only variables. The progression helps students see that quantities can be known or unknown, and they can stay
  the same or vary, but both kinds of quantities can be expressed with numbers or letters.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Let students know that they will now begin exploring a variety of different scenarios beyond Geometry. Each scenario
  will have the theme of representing quantities and relationships with expressions and equations.<br></p>

  <p><em>Writing, Listening, Conversing: MLR1 Stronger and Clearer Each Time.</em> Use this routine to help students
    improve their written responses to the final question. Give students time to meet with one to two partners to share
    and get feedback on their responses. Display feedback prompts that will help students strengthen their ideas and
    clarify their language. For example, “Can you describe the quantities?,” “What operation was used?,” and “Can you
    try to explain this using a different example?” Invite students to go back and revise their written explanation
    based on the feedback from peers. This will help students understand situations in which quantities are related
    through communicating their reasoning with a partner.

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Write an equation to represent each situation.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Blueberries are $4.99 a pound. Diego buys \( b \) pounds of blueberries and pays $14.95.
  </li>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( 4.99 \cdot b = 14.95 \)</p>
  <li>Blueberries are $4.99 a pound. Jada buys \( p \) pounds of blueberries and pays \( c \) dollars.
  </li>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( 4.99 \cdot p = c \)</p>
  <li>Blueberries are \( d \) dollars a pound. Lin buys \( q \) pounds of blueberries and pays \( t \) dollars.
  </li>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( d \cdot q = t \)</p>
  <li>Noah earned \( n \) dollars over the summer. Mai earned $275, which is $45 more than Noah did.
  </li>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( n + 45 = 275 \) or \( 275 - 45 = n \) (or equivalent)</p>
  <li>Noah earned \( v \) dollars over the summer. Mai earned \( m \) dollars, which is 45 dollars more than Noah did.
  </li>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( v + 45 = m \) or \( m - 45 = v \) (or equivalent)</p>
  <li>Noah earned \( w \) dollars over the summer. Mai earned \( x \) dollars, which is \( y \) dollars more than Noah
    did.
  </li>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( w + y = x \) or \( x - y = w \) (or equivalent)</p>
  <li>How are the equations you wrote for the blueberry purchases like the equations you wrote for Mai&rsquo;s and
    Noah&rsquo;s summer earnings? How are they different?
  </li>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each equation involves three quantities.</li>
    <li>The first equation has two known quantities, the second has one known quantity, and the last one has no known
      quantities.</li>
  </ul><br>
  <p>They are different in that: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The three quantities in each set are different. In the first set, they are unit price, pounds of blueberries,
      and total cost. In the second set, they are Noah&rsquo;s earnings, Mai&rsquo;s earnings, and the difference
      between the two.</li>
    <li>In the first set, the relationship involves multiplication. In the second, it involves addition (or
      subtraction).</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may translate &ldquo;Mai earned \( m \) dollars, which is 45 more dollars than Noah did&rdquo; as \( m + 45
  = v \), not paying attention to where the plus sign should go. As with other problems throughout this unit, encourage
  students to try using numbers in their equation to see if the equation really says what they want it to say.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Focus the discussion on students&rsquo; observations about how the two sets of equations are alike. Then, ask how the
  equations within each set are different. If students mention that some quantities are known or are fixed and others
  are not, ask them to specify which ones are which.</p>
<p>Highlight the idea that sometimes we know how quantities are related, but the value of each quantity may be unknown
  or may change. We often use letters to represent those unknown or changing quantities. </p>
<p>There might be times, however, when we use letters to represent quantities that are known or are constant. Doing so
  may help us focus on the relationship rather than the numbers. Tell students we will look at examples of such
  situations in upcoming activities.</p>
<h3>1.2.3: Self Check</h3>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold"><em>Following the activity, students will answer the following question to check their
    understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">QUESTION:</p>
<p>Max and Jules are renting a car for their 3-day trip. The rental company charges $50 per day and $0.40 per mile
  driven. Which is a possible equation for their cost of the rental car?</p>

        <p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: The cost per mile should represent 40 cents, which is 0.40.
          The correct answer is \( C=50(3)+0.40m \).</p>

        <p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: This equation shows they traveled 3 miles. The number of
          miles is unknown, \( m \), and the cost per mile should be 0.40. The cost per day is $50, and the number of
          days is known, 3. The correct answer is \( C=50(3)+0.40m \).</p>

        <p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: Look for the known and unknown values. The cost per day is
          known, $50. The number of days of the trip is known, 3. The number of miles driven is unknown, \( m \). The
          cost per mile is known, $0.40. The correct answer is \( C=50(3)+0.40m \).</p>

        <p>That&rsquo;s correct! Check yourself: They will pay $50 times 3 days plus 0.40 multiplied by the number of
          miles, \( C=50(3)+0.40m \).</p><br>

<br>
<p>Here are the steps to writing an equation to represent a real-world scenario:</p>
<div class="os-raise-graybox">
  <p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Read the problem. <br>
    <strong>Step 2</strong> - Identify the variables and known values. If needed, sketch a picture of the scenario.<br>

<h4>Try It: Writing an Equation to Represent a Real-World Problem</h4>
<p>Translate the following scenario into an equation:</p>
<p>A married couple together earns $110,000 a year. The wife earns $16,000 less than twice what her husband earns. What
  does the husband earn?</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Here is how to turn this scenario into an equation using the four-step process:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>. Read the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>. Identify the variables and known values.</p>
<p>The husband and wife earn $110,000 a year.&nbsp;The wife earns $16,000 less than twice what her husband
  earns.&nbsp;Let \(h\) = the amount the husband earns.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>. Write a sentence using the relationship among the values.</p>
<p>\(2h - 16,000\) = the amount the wife earns.&nbsp;Together the husband and wife earn $110,000.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>. Translate the sentence into an equation.</p>
<p>\(h + 2h - 16,000 = $110,000\)</p>
