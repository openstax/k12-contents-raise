<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<br>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>The expression \(16t^2\) represents the distance in feet an object falls after \(t\) seconds. Assume an object is dropped from a height of 906 feet.</p>
<ol>
  <li>What is the height of the object in feet 2 seconds after it is dropped?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The object is at 842 feet 2 seconds after it&rsquo;s dropped. \(906-16(2)^2=906-16(4)=906-64=842\)
  </li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
  <li>Write an expression representing the height of the object in feet \(t\) seconds after it is dropped.</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;\(906-16t^2\)</p>

<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
