<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students continue to familiarize themselves with the process of entering information into Desmos. They use quadratic regression on a data set to find the equation of a curve of best fit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next activity, they will use a similar curve of best fit to make predictions about a situation.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in pairs or groups, if necessary, so they have access to Desmos. If possible, allow students to work individually so that each understands the steps necessary to find a curve of best fit.</p>
<p>Read the activity introduction as a class. Ask students if they remember finding the line of best fit of a data set. Introduce the new vocabulary words. Tell students they have already used linear regression in a previous lesson, and they will now use quadratic regression.</p>
<p>Allow students to open the graphed data set in <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/9af142d34f5d7574972f99f2bc388b79e5d3d820" target="_blank">Desmos</a> and answer question 2. If possible, display the graph for the class to see. Read each bullet point in question 3 before entering the equation. Demonstrate the keys pressed to accurately enter the equation, \(y_1 \sim ax_1^2+bx_1+ c\).&nbsp; Then, if possible, instruct students to enter the equation on their own screens.</p>
<p>Allow students to complete questions 5&ndash;9 on their own. Remind them that exponents may be entered using the <q>^</q> symbol.</p>
<p>For English language learners, display the keys that need to be pressed to enter the equation for the curve of best fit:</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>In a previous lesson, you learned how to find the line of best fit. A line of best fit is a line on a graph that best approximates the equation of the points in a data set or scatter plot.</p>
<p>In this activity, we will learn how to find the curve of best fit, which is the curve modeled by the equation that best approximates the points in a data set or scatter plot. Since our data set is based on a quadratic function, we must use a curve instead of a line. This process, called quadratic regression, is the process of determining the equation of a parabola that best fits a data set.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>Click on the Desmos link to show the data set.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/9af142d34f5d7574972f99f2bc388b79e5d3d820" target="_blank">Desmos: The Data Set</a></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li>Examine the data. Do they appear to you to form a line or a curve?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;They appear to be the start of a curve.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
<li>We will use graphing technology to find a curve of best fit. Click the pointer below the table into entry box #2 to enter a new function. The cursor should start blinking. Enter the equation:</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p> \(y_1 \sim ax_1^2+bx_1+ c\)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> Notice that when you type the <q>1</q> after \(y\) or \(x\), Desmos automatically places it as subscript. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> Also notice that we are not using an equal sign. The symbol <q>~</q> means approximately and tells Desmos to approximate a line or curve of best fit. It should be in the top-left corner of your keyboard, and you might press it using the Shift button. If you are using the Desmos on-screen keyboard, it will be on the ABC keyboard. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> After pressing the subscript 1 after the \(y\) and the first \(x\), use the <q>^</q> symbol to tell Desmos you would like to enter an exponent. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
<li>Once you have entered the curve of best fit, you can press Enter. The curve of best fit will appear. Your screen will look like this:</li>
</ol>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
<li>Look in the lower-left corner of the screen. We will use the \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) values to construct the equation for our curve of best fit.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
<li>What is the value of \(a\) rounded to the nearest hundredth?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> -0.86</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="7">
<li>What is the value of \(b\) rounded to the nearest hundredth?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 8.09</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="8">
<li>What is the value of \(c\) rounded to the nearest hundredth?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 16.53</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="9">
<li>Write an equation in the form \(y = ax^2+ bx + c\) for the curve of best fit using the values you found.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(y = -0.86x^2 + 8.09x + 16.53\)</p>
<p>This is the equation for your curve of best fit.</p>
<p>You may notice the \(R^2\) value. The closer this value is to 1, the better your curve of best fit matches the data set. The \(R^2\) value for this data set is 0.9972. Since this value is relatively close to 1, this curve of best fit is a reasonably accurate match to the data set.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Reinforce the idea that the curve of best fit does not precisely align with each point in the data set. In other words, no point in the data set is guaranteed to fall exactly onto the curve of best fit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inform students that while the \(R^2\) value is an important measurement of how closely the curve of best fit matches the data set, we will not be using it in this lesson.</p>
<p>To review key ideas from the activity, discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> <q>If you graph the equation, \(y = -0.86x^2 + 8.09x + 16.53\), into Desmos, how will it compare to the curve of best fit shown on the screen now?</q> (It will be nearly identical, aside from rounding differences, to the curve of best fit that was derived using the equation, \(y_1 \sim ax_1^2+bx_1+ c\).) </li>
<li> <q>What do you think would happen if you changed one of the values in the data set?</q> (Changing the value of a point in the data set would change the equation of the curve of best fit. It would no longer be \(y = -0.86x^2 + 8.09x + 16.53\).) </li>
</ul>
<p>Use <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/72b4eac6ab93351be5701936888e9fca3226e977" target="_blank">Desmos</a> to demonstrate that by changing a value in one point of the data set even slightly, the curve of best fit changes.</p>
