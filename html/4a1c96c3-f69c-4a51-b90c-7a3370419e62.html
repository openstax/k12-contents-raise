<h3>Warm Up (10 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm up introduces some quadratic functions that arise naturally in finding the areas of different shapes. While
  students are not explicitly asked to find the area of geometric patterns in this lesson, the expressions that they
  write for the number of small squares in the patterns are effectively formulas for area (in terms of the number of
  small squares).</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Ask both partners in each group to write the area expressions for Figure A,
  complete the first column of the table, and discuss their responses. Then, ask one partner to write the expressions
  for Figure B and the other partner to write the expressions for Figure C.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Figure A is a large square. Figure B is a large square with a smaller square removed. Figure C is composed of two
  large squares with one smaller square added.</p>

<p>Write an expression to represent the area of each shaded figure when the side length of the large square is as shown
  in the first column.</p>
<p>Copy and complete the table. Compare your work by answering questions 1&ndash;12.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their expressions and record and display them for all to see. Include all equivalent
  expressions. Students may notice that all the expressions have a variable or a term that is squared. Explain that all
  of the expressions are quadratic expressions. Some expressions may seem familiar (for example, the expressions
  representing the area of Figure A) and others may seem quite foreign, but we know that each of them represents the
  area of a figure given a particular side length of the square.</p>
