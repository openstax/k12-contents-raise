<p>Here are graphs of a linear function and a quadratic function. The quadratic function is defined by the expressionÂ </p>
<p>\((x-4)^2-5\)</p>
<p>Find the coordinates of P, Q, and R without using graphing technology. Show your reasoning.</p>
<p><img alt="Graph of a linear function and a quadratic function on a coordinate plane. The y-intercept for the linear function that is graphed in blue is labeled as (0, negative 7). The x-intercept for the linear function is labeled as (7, 0). The black parabola intersects the y-axis at point P and intersects the line at points Q and R. Points P and Q occur on the left side of the parabola's axis of symmetry while point R is on the right side." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/1c1813e4c9101d3e2aa096dcc45915999fb4534a"/></p>
