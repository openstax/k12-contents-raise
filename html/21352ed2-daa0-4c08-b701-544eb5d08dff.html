<p>To summarize the key concepts from the lesson, pose these sample questions again to see if students have learned all of these situations:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Which strategy is applicable to factoring binomials? (difference of squares; factoring the GCF) </li>
  <li> Which strategy is applicable to factoring trinomials of the form \(x^2 + bx +c\)? (undoing FOIL) </li>
  <li> Which strategy is applicable to factoring trinomials of the form \(ax^2 + bx +c\)? (trial and error, the &ldquo;\(ac\)&rdquo; method) </li>
  <li> Which strategy is applicable to factoring trinomials of the form \(ax^2 \pm 2ab + b^2\)? (perfect square trinomials) </li>
  <li> Which strategy is applicable to factoring polynomials with 4 expressions? (grouping) </li>
  <li> Which strategy is applicable to polynomials that don&rsquo;t seem to factor easily? (substitution, grouping, factoring the GCF) </li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
