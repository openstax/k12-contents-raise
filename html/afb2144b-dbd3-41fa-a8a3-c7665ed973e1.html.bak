<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>For questions 1–4, use the following scenario to write, graph, and find solutions to inequalities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A band is playing at an auditorium with floor seats and balcony seats. The band wants to sell the floor tickets for $15 each and balcony tickets for $12 each. They want to make at least $3,000 in ticket sales.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>How much money will they collect for selling \( x \) floor tickets?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( 15x \)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li>How much money will they collect for selling \( y \) balcony tickets?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( 12y \)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
<li>Write an inequality whose solutions are the number of floor and balcony tickets sold if they make at least $3,000 in ticket sales.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( 15x+12y \geq 3,\!000 \)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
<li>Use the graphing tool or technology outside the course. Graph the inequality that represents this scenario. Students were provided access to Desmos.</li>
