<h4>Solving a Quadratic Equation Set Equal to Zero</h4>
<p>The expressions \(h(40 &minus; 10h)\) and \(-10h^2 + 40h\) define the same function. The function models the height of a weather balloon in miles \(h\) hours after it is released.</p>
<ol>
  <li>What equation can be used to determine the times the weather balloon is on the ground?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution:<br>
  When the weather balloon is on the ground, the expression will equal 0. So, the equation \(h(40 &minus; 10h) = 0\) represents the weather balloon when it is on the ground.</p>

  <li>How can we solve the equation \(h(40 &minus; 10h) = 0\)?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution:<br>
  We know that any value multiplied by 0 equals 0. So, if \(h\) or \((40 - 10h)\) equals 0, then the left side of the equation will also equal 0.</p>
<p>The weather balloon is on the ground at 0 hours. Now, let&rsquo;s find the solution to \(40 - 10h = 0\).</p>
<p>\(40 - 10h = 0\)</p>
<p>\(40 = 10h\)</p>
<p>\(4 = h\)</p>
<p>The weather balloon is also on the ground after 4 hours.</p>

  <li>A scientist wants to determine the two different times when the weather balloon is 30 miles above Earth. Write an equation to represent these times.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution:<br>
  The times when the weather balloon is 30 miles above Earth are represented by the equation \(h(40 &minus; 10h) = 30\) or the equation \(-10h^2 + 40h = 30\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>If the weather balloon is 30 miles above Earth after 1 hour, find another time that the weather balloon is 30 miles above Earth.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution:<br>
  We know the total trip takes the weather balloon 4 hours. Since the graph representing the flight of the weather balloon is symmetric, if it takes 1 hour to reach 30 miles up, then 1 hour from touching the ground, it will be at 30 miles up again. So, the weather balloon will be 30 miles above Earth after 3 hours.</p>
