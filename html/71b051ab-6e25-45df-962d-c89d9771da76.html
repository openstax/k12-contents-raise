<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>Earlier, students noticed that the numbers in a quadratic expression in vertex form are related to the coordinates of the vertex of the graph. Here, they investigate those connections closely. Just as they have done with expressions in standard and factored forms, students use technology to experiment with each parameter of expressions in vertex form and study the effects on the graph. In this process, they practice looking for regularity in repeated reasoning. If working with a partner, students will take turns using the graphing technology and recording observations. As students trade roles explaining their thinking and listening, they have opportunities to explain their reasoning and critique the reasoning of others.</p>
<p>The work also encourages students to begin looking at the structure of the form&mdash;\(a\) squared expression with a coefficient \(a\) and a constant term. In an upcoming lesson, they will further make sense of how this structure relates to the graph.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Provide access to graphing technology. Consider arranging students in groups of two. For the first two questions involving graphing, ask one partner to operate the graphing technology and the other to record the group's observations, and then to switch roles halfway.</p>
<p>Consider pausing for a class discussion after the second question so students can share their observations. When discussing the effects of adding a constant term to \((x&minus;h)^2\), ask students how the vertical movement of the vertex affects the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph. If not mentioned by students, point out that in some cases it produces graphs that are away from the \(x\)-axis and thus have no \(x\)-intercepts.</p>
<p>Encourage students to put their graphing technology out of reach while they work on the third question.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>Use the graphing tool or technology outside the course. Graph \(y=x^2\). Then, add different numbers to \(x\) before it is squared (for example, \(y=(x+4)^2\), \(y=(x&minus;3)^2\)) and observe how the graph changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select th<strong>e solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Adding a number to \(x\) moves the graph to the left. Subtracting a number (or adding a negative number) moves the graph to the right. The vertex stays on the \(x\)-axis.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li>Use the graphing tool or technology outside the course. Graph \(y=(x&minus;1)^2\). Then, experiment with each of the following changes to the function and see how they affect the graph and the vertex.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
<li> Add different constant terms to \((x&minus;1)^2\) (for example: \(y=(x&minus;1)^2+5\), \(y=(x&minus;1)^2&minus;9)\). </li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the<strong> solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Adding a constant term moves it up and subtracting moves it down. The \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex doesn't change.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2" type="a">
<li> Multiplying \((x&minus;1)^2\) by different coefficients (for example: \(y=3(x&minus;1)^2\), \(y=-2(x&minus;1)^2\), \(y=0.5(x&minus;1)^2\). </li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Multiplying the squared term by a number doesn't change the vertex, but it changes the opening of the graph to "wider" or "narrower," or changes the direction of the graph to open upward or downward.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Consider displaying the incomplete table and inviting students to write in one of their correct responses. Then, ask students what they notice about the structure or composition of the expressions. Draw students' attention to the following:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> All expressions in the table have a squared term. </li>
<li> Most of the squared terms contain a sum or a difference of \(x\) and a number. For the one example where the squared term is not a sum or a difference, we can think of it as having a sum of \(x\) and 0. </li>
<li> The squared term may have a coefficient, which can be positive or negative. </li>
<li> Most expressions have a constant term. For the one example without a constant term, we can think of the constant term as 0. </li>
</ul>
<p>To help students consolidate their observations, display the following sentence starters and ask students to complete them based on their work:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> When a quadratic equation is in vertex form of \(y=a(x&minus;h)^2+k\), the coordinates of the vertex are \(( , )\). </li>
<li> When the equation is graphed, the graph opens upward if . . . </li>
<li> The graph opens downward if . . . </li>
</ul>
<p>If not mentioned by students, point out that when a quadratic equation is in vertex form of \(y=a(x&minus;h)^2+k\), the coordinates of the vertex are \((h,k)\). Also point out that when the equation is graphed, the graph of the equation opens upward if \(a\) is positive and opens downward if \(a\) is negative.</p>
<p>Tell students that, in a future lesson, we will take a closer look at how the parts of a quadratic equation in vertex form, \(y=a(x&minus;h)^2+k\), produce the behaviors they observed on the graph.</p>

<h3>7.15.3: Additional Resources</h3>
<p><strong><em>The following content is available to students who would like more support based on their experience with the self check. Students will not automatically have access to this content, so you may wish to share it with those who could benefit from it.</em></strong></p>
<h4>Using Vertex Form</h4>
<p>The vertex form of a quadratic is below:</p>
<p><img height="157" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/1a98c55ddb5612a215745e1087e68a20afdfaa9a" width="550"></p>
<p>Notice that the value of \(h\) is the opposite of what it is in the parenthesis. This seems odd: when we add \(k\), the vertex of the parabola moves up \(k\) units. But when we subtract \(h\) within the squared term, the vertex of the parabola moves right \(h\) units, not left.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore why. We know the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex is \(y = k\). To find that using this equation, we need to know where \(a(x-h)^2\) is zero, because that will make \(y=k\). Set \(a(x-h)^2=0\) . This happens when \(x-h=0\), which is when \(x=h\). That means \(h\) is the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Find the vertex of \(y=3(x-4)^2-2\).</p>
<p>The parabola of the quadratic will shift right 4 (remember this horizontal shift is counterintuitive and translates in the opposite direction of what the expression &ldquo;looks like&rdquo;) and down 2.</p>
<p>So, the vertex is at \((4, -2)\).</p>
