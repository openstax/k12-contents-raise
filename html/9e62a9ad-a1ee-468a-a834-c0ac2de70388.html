<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this culminating lesson, students integrate the ideas from the unit and engage in multiple aspects of mathematical modeling.</p>
<p>In the first activity, they interpret and analyze given models that represent the constraints and conditions in a situation. In the second activity, they create their own models after specifying quantities of interest, identifying relevant information, and setting the constraints.
</p>

<h4>Project Activities</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Determining a Solution to Inequalities <strong>(5 minutes)</strong></li>
  <li>Interpret a Set of Mathematical Models <strong>(20 minutes)</strong></li>
  <li>Perform Mathematical Modeling <strong>(20 minutes)</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>Required Materials</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Graphing technology</li>
  <li>Tools for creating a visual display</li> 
</ol>
<h4>Required Preparation</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Provide copies of the activity sheet for students to use to collect their thinking.</li>
<li>Acquire devices that can run Desmos (recommended) or other graphing technology. It is ideal if each student has their own device. (If students typically access the digital version of the materials, Desmos is available under Math Tools.)</li>
