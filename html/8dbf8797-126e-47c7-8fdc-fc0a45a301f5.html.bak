<p>In this activity, whenever you see ðŸ’¬, stop and share your responses with your partner. If you have different responses, try to come to a consensus.</p>
<p>Today you are going to investigate something called an interactive simulation. It is a tool that will help you visualize how area model multiplication works.</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-center"><img alt="A dark screen with the title Area Model Algebra. Three options: Explore (highlighted, showing a grid with 10 by 10  split to 5,and 5 labeled on left under the number 10 and 3 and 7 labeled on the top under the number 10), Generic, Variables, and Game are displayed.in unhighlighted boxes t the right." height="300" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/a493a42c26d1423b95882a4b58a48f3b7668df12"/></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/area-model-algebra/latest/area-model-algebra_en.html?screens=1,2,3" target="_blank">Open the interactive simulator</a>, Area Model Algebra in your web browser. You will use it to complete this project. It will look like the image above.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Play with any of the screens on Area Model Algebra for 5 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Complete the following questions.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<p><li>What does the area of a rectangle have to do with multiplication? ðŸ’¬</li></p>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<p><li>Write down two things you notice or have questions about, and one thing a neighbor noticed that is interesting to you. </li></p></ol>
