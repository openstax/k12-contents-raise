<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students take turns with a partner, matching graphs of residuals to scatter plots that
  display linear models. Students trade roles, explaining their thinking and listening, providing opportunities to
  explain their reasoning and critique the reasoning of others. They should begin to recognize that a plot of the
  residuals for data that are fit well by a linear model shows residuals that are close to the \(x\)-axis and do not
  show a noticeable trend.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Demonstrate how to set up and find matches. Choose a student to be your
  partner. Mix up the cards and place them face up. Point out that the cards contain either a scatter plot with a linear
  model or a graph of the residuals. Select one of each style of card and then explain to your partner why you think the
  cards do or do not match. Demonstrate productive ways to collaborate, by agreeing or respectfully disagreeing. Start
  out by explaining your own mathematical thinking and asking clarifying questions. Give each group a set of cut-up
  cards for matching.</p>

  <p><em>Writing, Conversing: MLR1 Stronger and Clearer Each Time. </em>Use this routine to help students
    improve their writing by providing them with multiple opportunities to clarify their explanations through
    conversation. Give students time to meet with 2&ndash;3 partners to share their response to the last question.
    Students should first check to see if they agree with each other about who had the better estimate of the line of
    best fit. Provide listeners with prompts for feedback that will help their partner add detail to strengthen and
    clarify their ideas. For example, students can ask their partner: &ldquo;How did you use the graph of the residuals
    to make your decision?&rdquo; or &rdquo;How do you know . . . ?&rdquo; Next, provide students with 3&ndash;4 minutes
    to revise their initial draft based on feedback from their peers. This will help students produce a written
    justification for determining best estimates of lines of best fit.<br><em>Design Principle(s): Support sense-making; Optimize output (for explanation</em>)</p>

  <li>Match the scatter plots and given linear models to the graph of the residuals.</li>
  <li>Turn over the scatter plots so that only the residuals are visible. Based on the residuals, which line would
    produce the most accurate estimates? Which line fits its data worst?</li>

<h5>What Do Residual Plots Tell Us?</h5>
<p>Residuals tell us how accurate a line of best fit really is.</p>
<p>Ideally, the residual from a line of best fit will be scattered randomly above and below the horizontal line of 0 on the residual plot. The residual plot would have points above and below the horizontal line of 0. This shows that the relationship between the two variables in the data set can be approximated by a linear model.</p>
<p>When a residual is on 0, this indicates that the line of best fit goes through its corresponding point.</p>
<p>A curved pattern shows that a nonlinear model would be better to describe the relationships between points.</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li>What does Tyler&rsquo;s line of best fit look like according to the graph of the residuals?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> The data are between 10 and 30 grams above the line of best fit.</li>
    <li>How well does Tyler&rsquo;s line of best fit model the data? Be prepared to show your reasoning.<br><strong>Answer:</strong> Tyler’s line does not model the data well because all of the residuals are positive.</li>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
    <li>What does Lin&rsquo;s line of best fit look like in comparison to the data?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> The line is below the lower half of the data and above the second half of the data.</li>
    <li>How well does Lin&rsquo;s line of best fit model the data? Be prepared to show your reasoning.<br><strong>Answer:</strong> It is not a good fit because the first several residuals are all positive and the last several residuals are negative. They should not have a pattern if the line of best fit is good.</li>

    <li>What does Kiran&rsquo;s line of best fit look like in comparison to the data?<br><strong>Answer:</strong> Kiran’s line appears to go through the middle of the data with some points above and some points below the line.</li>
    <li>How well does Kiran&rsquo;s line of best fit model the data? Be prepared to show your reasoning.<br><strong>Answer:</strong> Kiran’s line of best fit is a good one because it appears to pass through the middle of the data.</li>
  <li>Who has the best estimate of the line of best fit: Tyler, Lin, or Kiran? Be prepared to show your reasoning.<br><strong>Answer:</strong> Kiran’s line of best fit is the best because the graph of the residuals lets me know that some points are above the line of best fit and some are below. In addition, two of the residuals are close to 0, so that indicates that the line passes through or near those 2 points. Tylers line of best fit is not a good one because it is above all the data. Lin’s line of best fit is below all the lower data values and above all the high data values, so it is not a good fit.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>The goal is to make sure students understand the connections between a scatter plot displaying a linear model and a
  graph of the residuals. A good linear model for the data will have residuals that are scattered on either side of the
  \(x\)-axis without a clear pattern and close to the axis.</p>
<p>Much discussion takes place between partners. Invite students to share how they made the matches.</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;What were some ways you handled finding the matches for B and C? Recall that B and C used the same data but
    different linear models.&rdquo; (The line in C was not as good of a fit as line B, so I knew the graph of the
    residuals would be farther away from the horizontal axis.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Look at the matches for E and J. How can you tell from the graph of the residuals that the linear model is
    not a line of best fit?&rdquo; (The first half of the residuals are positive, and the second half are negative. This
    lets me know that the line does not pass through the middle of the data.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;What do you notice about the residuals in graph K? Explain what you notice in the context of scatter plot
    A.&rdquo; (The residuals go in a u-shaped pattern. The data in the scatter plot do not appear linear and are curved,
    so when you plot a line through them, you would expect the residuals to show the curvature.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Describe any difficulties you experienced and how you resolved them.&rdquo; (It was tough figuring out how
    to decide where to begin when finding matches. I used my partner&rsquo;s strategy of looking at the values on the
    \(x\)-axis to help narrow down the choices.)</li>

<h4>The Meaning of Residuals</h4>
<p>Suppose that you have a scatter plot and that you have drawn the line of best fit on your plot. Remember that
    the residual for a point in the scatter plot is the vertical distance of that point from the line of best fit. In
    the previous lesson, you looked at a scatter plot showing how fuel efficiency was related to curb weight for five
    compact cars. The scatter plot and line of best fit are shown below.</p>
<p><img
    alt="A SCATTER PLOT THAT SHOWS CURB WEIGHT IN HUNDREDS OF POUNDS ON THE X-AXIS AND FUEL EFFICIENCY IN MILES PER GALLON ON THE Y-AXIS. A LINE OF BEST FIT IS DRAWN. FOUR POINTS ARE ABOVE THE LINE AND ONE POINT IS BELOW."

</p>
<p>Consider the following questions:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>What kind of residual does Point A have? </li><br><p class="os-raise-indent">Point A has a large positive residual.</p>
  <li>What kind of residual does Point B have?</li><br><p class="os-raise-indent">Point B has a small positive residual.</p>
  <li>What kind of residual does Point C have?</li><br><p class="os-raise-indent">Point C has a very large negative residual.</p>

<h4>Try It: The Meaning of Residuals</h4>
<p>Suppose you are given a scatter plot and a line of best fit that looks like this:</p>
<p><img
    alt="A SCATTER PLOT WITH A LINE OF BEST FIT DRAWN. FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, POINTS ARE BELOW THE LINE, ABOVE THE LINE, AND THEN BELOW THE LINE."

<p>Describe what you think the residual plot would look like.</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Compare your answer: here is how to sketch the residual plot.</p>
<p>Moving from left to right, the points initially tend to be below the line of best fit, then move above it, and
    then below it. The residuals are negative, then positive, and then negative again. This means that the points in the
    residual plot will be below the horizontal axis, then above it, and then below it again.</p>
<p>The residual plot has an arch shape like this:</p>
