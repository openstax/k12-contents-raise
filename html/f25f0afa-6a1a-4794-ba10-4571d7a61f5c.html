<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p dir="ltr">In this activity, students take turns with a partner, matching graphs of residuals to scatter plots that display linear models. Students trade roles, explaining their thinking and listening, providing opportunities to explain their reasoning and critique the reasoning of others. They should begin to recognize that a plot of the residuals for data that are fit well by a linear model shows residuals that are close to the \(x\)-axis and do not show a noticeable trend.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Arrange students in groups of 2. Demonstrate how to set up and find matches. Choose a student to be your partner. Mix up the cards and place them face up. Point out that the cards contain either a scatter plot with a linear model or a graph of the residuals. Select one of each style of card and then explain to your partner why you think the cards do or do not match. Demonstrate productive ways to collaborate, by agreeing or respectfully disagreeing. Start out by explaining your own mathematical thinking and asking clarifying questions. Give each group a set of cut-up cards for matching.</p>

  <p dir="ltr"><em>Writing, Conversing: MLR1 Stronger and Clearer Each Time. </em>Use this routine to help students improve their writing by providing them with multiple opportunities to clarify their explanations through conversation. Give students time to meet with 2&ndash;3 partners to share their response to the last question. Students should first check to see if they agree with each other about who had the better estimate of the line of best fit. Provide listeners with prompts for feedback that will help their partner add detail to strengthen and clarify their ideas. For example, students can ask their partner: &ldquo;How did you use the graph of the residuals to make your decision?&rdquo; or &rdquo;How do you know . . . ?&rdquo; Next, provide students with 3&ndash;4 minutes to revise their initial draft based on feedback from their peers. This will help students produce a written justification for determining best estimates of lines of best fit.</p>

<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Match the scatter plots and given linear models to the graph of the residuals.</li>
  <li>Turn over the scatter plots so that only the residuals are visible. Based on the residuals, which line would produce the most accurate estimates? Which line fits its data worst?</li>
</ol>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<ol>
  <li>&nbsp;<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
      <li>A matches with K</li>
      <li>B matches with G</li>
      <li>C matches with L</li>
      <li>D matches with H</li>
      <li>E matches with J</li>
      <li>F matches with I</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>B fits its data the best. C or E fits its data the worst.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;<span>What Do Residual Plots Tell Us?</span></p>
<p>Residuals tell us how accurate a line of best fit really is.</p>
<p>Ideally, the residual from a line of best fit will be scattered randomly above and below the horizontal line of 0 on the residual plot. The residual plot would have points above and below the horizontal line of 0. This shows that the relationship between the two variables in the data set can be approximated by a linear model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a residual is on 0, this indicates that the line of best fit goes through its corresponding point.</p>
<p>A curved pattern shows that a nonlinear model would be better to describe the relationships between points.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>The goal is to make sure students understand the connections between a scatter plot displaying a linear model and a graph of the residuals. A good linear model for the data will have residuals that are scattered on either side of the \(x\)-axis without a clear pattern and close to the axis.</p>
<p>Much discussion takes place between partners. Invite students to share how they made the matches.</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;What were some ways you handled finding the matches for B and C? Recall that B and C used the same data but different linear models.&rdquo; (The line in C was not as good of a fit as line B, so I knew the graph of the residuals would be farther away from the horizontal axis.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Look at the matches for E and J. How can you tell from the graph of the residuals that the linear model is not a line of best fit?&rdquo; (The first half of the residuals are positive, and the second half are negative. This lets me know that the line does not pass through the middle of the data.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;What do you notice about the residuals in graph K? Explain what you notice in the context of scatter plot A.&rdquo; (The residuals go in a u-shaped pattern. The data in the scatter plot do not appear linear and are curved, so when you plot a line through them, you would expect the residuals to show the curvature.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Describe any difficulties you experienced and how you resolved them.&rdquo; (It was tough figuring out how to decide where to begin when finding matches. I used my partner&rsquo;s strategy of looking at the values on the \(x\)-axis to help narrow down the choices.)</li>
</ul>

<p><span>The Meaning of Residuals</span><br></p>
<p><span>Suppose that you have a scatter plot and that you have drawn the line of best fit on your plot. Remember that the residual for a point in the scatter plot is the vertical distance of that point from the line of best fit. In the previous lesson, you looked at a scatter plot showing how fuel efficiency was related to curb weight for five compact cars. The scatter plot and line of best fit are shown below.</span><br></p>
<p><img alt="A SCATTER PLOT THAT SHOWS CURB WEIGHT IN HUNDREDS OF POUNDS ON THE X-AXIS AND FUEL EFFICIENCY IN MILES PER GALLON ON THE Y-AXIS. A LINE OF BEST FIT IS DRAWN. FOUR POINTS ARE ABOVE THE LINE AND ONE POINT IS BELOW." class="atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="398" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/06f888b0d9412ba32049e5eeb65ac188265286eb" width="450"><br></p>
<p>Consider the following questions:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>What kind of residual does Point A have? <br>Point A has a large positive residual.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>What kind of residual does Point B have? <br>Point B has a small positive residual.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>What kind of residual does Point C have? <br>Point C has a very large negative residual.</li>

<h4>Try It: The Meaning of Residuals</h4>
<p><span>Suppose you are given a scatter plot and a line of best fit that looks like this:</span><br></p>
<p><img alt="A SCATTER PLOT WITH A LINE OF BEST FIT DRAWN. FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, POINTS ARE BELOW THE LINE, ABOVE THE LINE, AND THEN BELOW THE LINE." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="411" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/e98902ab87bf79960aac410b87f0fb244d26c87f" width="450"><br></p>
<p>Describe what you think the residual plot would look like.</p>
<p><span>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to compare your work.</span><br></p>
<p><span>Solution</span><br></p>
<p>Here is how to sketch the residual plot:</p>
<p><span>Moving from left to right, the points initially tend to be below the line of best fit, then move above it, and then below it. The residuals are negative, then positive, and then negative again. This means that the points in the residual plot will be below the horizontal axis, then above it, and then below it again.&nbsp;</span><br></p>
<p><span>The residual plot has an arch shape like this:</span><br></p>
<p><img alt="A RESIDUAL PLOT THAT SHOWS FROM LEFT TO RIGHT POINTS BELOW THE HORIZONTAL AXIS, ABOVE THE HORIZONTAL AXIS, AND THEN BELOW THE HORIZONTAL AXIS.
