<p>For the following exercise, consider this scenario: For each year \(t\), the population of trees in Forest A is represented by the function \(A(t)=115(1.025)^t\), (red line). In a neighboring forest, Forest B, the population of the same type of tree is represented by the function \(B(t)=82(1.029)^t\), (blue line). Looking at the graph provided, which forest had a greater number of trees initially?</p>
