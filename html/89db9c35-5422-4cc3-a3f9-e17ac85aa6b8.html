<h4>Formulating a Quadratic Equation to Represent the Model</h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a similar situation to the previous activities but using a picture with different measurements.</p>
<p>Imagine a picture 8 inches by 6 inches. The frame is created from 32 square inches of framing material. The frame will be uniform in width, and all of the framing material is used.</p>
<p>How do we write an equation representing the total area of the framed picture?</p>
<p><img alt="A FRAMED PICTURE." height="232" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/bf047a5f6cfa1e2bcecc83d87d38dfcd8692117f" width="300"></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s break down the measurements that we know.</p>
<p>Let \(x\) represent the thickness of the frame in inches.</p>
<p><img alt="A rectangular picture has side lengths measuring 8 inches by 6 inches. It is surrounded by a frame that is uniformly x inches in width." height="317" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/dceee0cd555cd3e8fcb6de7750d4a66c50dbda52" width="350"></p>
<p>Since the picture is 8 inches by 6 inches, it has an area of 48 square inches.</p>
<p>The frame is created from 32 square inches of framing material, and we must use all of it. So, the total area of the framed picture is \(48 + 32\), or 80 square inches.</p>
<p>The length of one side of the framed picture is \(x + 6 + x = 2x + 6\).</p>
<p><img alt="A DIAGRAM REPRESENTING A RECTANGULAR PICTURE INSIDE A RECTANGULAR PICTURE FRAME IS SHOWN. THE RECTANGULAR PICTURE FRAME HAS A SIDE LENGTH OF 6 INCHES AND X AND X LABELED." height="232" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/03fd8be04c40854d0d85e8ca821618315df14678" width="350"></p>
<p>The length of the other side of the framed picture is \(x + 8 + x = 2x + 8\).</p>
<p><img alt="A DIAGRAM REPRESENTING A RECTANGULAR PICTURE INSIDE A RECTANGULAR PICTURE FRAME IS SHOWN. THE RECTANGULAR PICTURE FRAME HAS A SIDE LENGTH OF 8 INCHES AND X AND X LABELED." height="291" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c0de4d3970e836136536fbfcd0fbc25e4fcb56f9" width="300"></p>
<p>So, the area of the framed picture is \((2x + 8)(2x + 6)\). We can set this equal to 80 square inches.</p>
<p>\((2x + 8)(2x + 6) = 80\)</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s multiply.</p>
<p>\(4x^2 + 12x + 16x + 48 = 80\)</p>
<p>\(4x^2 + 28x + 48 = 80\)</p>
<p>So, the equation representing the total area of the framed picture is \(4x^2 + 28x + 48 = 80\).</p>
<p>This equation is a quadratic equation. A <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">quadratic equation</span> is defined as one that can be written in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where \(a\) is not 0.</p>

  <p>Here is how to find the quadratic equation to represent the total area of the framed picture:</p>
  <p>The area of the picture is 63 square inches. The total area of the framed picture will be \(63 + 36\), or 99 square inches.</p>
  <p>The sides of the framed picture are represented by \((2x + 9)\) and \((2x + 7)\).</p>
  <p>So, the total area of the framed picture is represented by \(4x^2 + 32x + 63 = 99\).</p>
