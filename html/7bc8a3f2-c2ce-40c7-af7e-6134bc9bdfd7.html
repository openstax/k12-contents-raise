<p>In this lesson, you will begin to understand what makes a sequence a geometric sequence and how that connects to exponential functions. Using graphs, you will explore how growing and shrinking patterns represent geometric sequences.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Find missing terms in a geometric sequence.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
