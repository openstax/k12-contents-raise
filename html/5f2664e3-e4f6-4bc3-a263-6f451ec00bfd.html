<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<div>
  <p></p>
</div>
<div>
  <p>Earlier in the unit, students saw that a linear inequality in one variable has many solutions, which are represented by all the points on one side of a number on a number line. They also recalled that a linear equation in two variables has many solutions, which are represented by all the points on the graph of the equation. The work in this activity builds on those understandings.</p>
  <p>Students see that the solutions to a linear inequality in two variables can be represented by many points on a coordinate plane, and that the set of points are in a region bounded by a line. To represent the set of all points that are solutions, we can shade that region. Students also see that the points that fall on the other side of the boundary line are not solutions to the inequality.</p>
  <p>During the activity, students are not yet expected to recognize that the line is the graph of an equation related to the inequality (although some students may notice that). That insight is made explicit in the synthesis and reinforced in the next activity.</p>

<h4>Launch</h4>
<div>
  <p>Display the inequality<span>\( 2x+3y \le 12 \)</span>for all to see, along with a blank coordinate grid.</p>
  <div><img alt="Blank x y coordinate plane with grid and origin labeled O. Both axes labeled from negative 10 to 8 by 2&rsquo;s." height="305" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/33d73f73610609c3217ae5f5bba32c9a322f97b9" width="314"><br><span><br>Remind students that earlier, in the warm-up, we saw that\( (0,5) \)and\( (\text-5, 10) \)are not solutions to this inequality, but\( (6,0) \)and\( (\text-1,\text-1) \)are solutions. On the coordinate plane, mark each point that is a solution with a dot and each point that is not a solution with an X (or use different colors to mark the points).</span></div>
  <div><span><br></span></div>
  <div><span>Then, ask each student to identify 3 coordinate pairs that are solutions and 3 pairs that are not solutions to the inequality. Encourage students to use some negative values of\( x \)and\( y \), and to find pairs that are different than those chosen by the people seated around them.</span></div>
  <div><span><br></span></div>
  <div><span>After a few minutes, poll the class to collect all ordered pairs that students identified and plot them on the blank coordinate grid (again, using different symbols or different colors for solutions and non-solutions).</span></div>
  <div><span><br></span></div>
  <div><span>When all the points are plotted, the plot might look something like the following. (Blue points represent solutions and yellow X's represent non-solutions.)</span></div>

Students are not expected to perfectly articulate the idea of a solution region at this point, but they should notice that the solutions are separated from non-solutions by what appears to be an invisible line that slants downwards from left to right.<br></span><span><br>When choosing their coordinate pairs, some students may have started with the equation\( 2x+3y=12 \)and plotted some solutions for that equation. If they suggest that the invisible line might be the graph of\( 2x+3y=12 \), that's great, but it is unnecessary to point this out otherwise.</span><span>Arrange students in groups of 3-4. Tell students that their job in this activity is to plot some points that do and do not represent solutions to a few inequalities. If time is limited, consider assigning 1-2 inequalities to each group.<br><br></span></div>

<h3>Student Facing Statement</h3>
<div>
  <p>Here are four inequalities. Study each inequality assigned to your group and work with your group to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Find some coordinate pairs that represent solutions to the inequality and some coordinate pairs that do not represent solutions.</li>
    <li>Plot both sets of points. Either use two different colors or two different symbols like X and O.</li>
    <li>Plot enough points until you start to see the region that contains solutions and the region that contains non-solutions. Look for a pattern describing the region where solutions are plotted.</li>

<h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>
<div>
  <p>If students don't know how to begin finding points that are solutions and points that are non-solutions, suggest that they pick any\( (x,y) \)pair and then determine if it makes the inequality true. This way, they don't have to worry about picking an "incorrect" point.</p>
</div>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<div>
  <p>Display four graphs that are representative of students' work for the four inequalities. (A document camera would be very helpful, if available.) In particular, look for examples where a student decided to "shade" all the points on one side of the boundary line.</p>
  <p>Invite students to make some observations about the graphs. Discuss questions such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>"What do the two sets of points represent?" (Solutions and non-solutions to the inequalities)</li>
    <li>"If we plot a new point somewhere on the coordinate plane, how can we tell if it is or is not a solution?" (There appears to be a line that separates the solutions from non-solutions. If it's on the same side of the line as other solutions, then it is a solution.)</li>
    <li>"What might be a good way to show all the possible solutions to a linear inequality in two variables? Is there a better way other than plotting individual points?" (We can shade the region that contains the points that are solutions.)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Ask students: "How can we tell where exactly the solution region stops and non-solution region starts?" Solicit some ideas from students. If no one predicts that the line is the graph of an equation related to the inequality, remind students that when we solved inequalities in one variable, we used a related equation to help us identify a boundary value (a point on a number line). We can do the same here.</p>
  <p>Take the first inequality,\( x \geq y \), as an example. Explain that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The solutions to\( x=y \)are all coordinate pairs where\( x \)and\( y \)are equal. We can graph it as line that goes through\( (\text-1, \text-1), (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) \), and so on.</li>
    <li>The solutions to\( x \geq y \)are all coordinate pairs where\( x \)equals ;\( y \)(such as the points previously noted), and where\( x \)is greater than\( y \)(such as\( (2,1), (3, 2), (4,2) \)). The latter are all located below the line.</li>
    <li>We can shade the region below the line to represent the solutions to\( x\geq y \).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In the next activity, students will take a closer look at whether the boundary line itself is part of the solution region. For now, it is sufficient that students see that the graph of an equation that is related to each inequality delineates the solution and non-solution regions.</p>

  <p><em></em>Use this routine to support whole-class discussion. For each observation that is shared, ask students to restate what they heard using precise mathematical language. Consider providing students time to restate what they hear to a partner before selecting one or two students to share with the class. Ask the original speaker if their peer was accurately able to restate their thinking. Call students' attention to any words or phrases that helped to clarify the original statement. This provides more students with an opportunity to produce language as they interpret the reasoning of others.<br><em></em></p>

<h4>Verify Solutions to an Inequality in Two Variables</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Previously we learned to solve inequalities with only one variable. We will now learn about inequalities containing two variables. In particular we will look at linear inequalities in two variables which are very similar to linear equations in two variables.</p>
<p>Linear inequalities in two variables have many applications. If you ran a business, for example, you would want your revenue to be greater than your costs&mdash;so that your business made a profit.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><span><strong>Linear Inequality</strong><br>A linear inequality is an inequality that can be written in one of the following forms:<br>\( Ax + By &gt; C \)\( Ax + By \geq C \)\( Ax + By &lt; C \)\( Ax + By \leq C \)<br></span></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p><span><span><br>Recall that an inequality with one variable had many solutions. For example, the solution to the inequality\( x &gt; 3 \) is any number greater than 3. We showed this on the number line by shading in the number line to the right of 3, and putting an open parenthesis at 3. See the figure below.</span><br></span></p>
<p><span><span><img alt class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="44" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/760f734b2bad15f7d6af2baae9b5a241d83fcef5" width="400"><br></span></span></p>
<p><span>Similarly, linear inequalities in two variables have many solutions. Any ordered pair\( (x, y) \) that makes an inequality true when we substitute in the values is a solution to a linear inequality.</span><br></p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><span><strong>Solution to a Linear Inequality</strong><br>An ordered pair\( (x,y) \) is a solution to a linear inequality if the inequality is true when we substitute the values of\( x \) and \( y \).</span></td>
