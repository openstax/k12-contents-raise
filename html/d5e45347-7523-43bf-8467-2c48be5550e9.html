<p>In this lesson, you will interpret equations and graphs of quadratic functions in terms of the situations they represent. Additionally, you will use your analyses to solve problems and to compare quadratic functions given in different representations.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Explain how a quadratic equation and its graph relate to a situation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li> 7.14.1: Evaluating Quadratic Functions in the Real World </li>
<li> 7.14.2: Interpreting a Functional Relationship Between Two Quantities </li>

</ul>
<li> 7.14.4: Using Quadratic Functions to Solve Problems </li>
<li> 7.14.5: Identifying Key Features of Graphed Functions </li>
</ul>
<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>
