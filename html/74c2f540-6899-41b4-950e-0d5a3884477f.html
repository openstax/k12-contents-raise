<p>Display this sequence \(J\) for all to see: 2, 8, 32, 128, . . . and give students a few minutes to represent it in as many ways as they can think of. Then, ask them to check in with their partner and see if their partner came up with any different ways. Time permitting, ask one student to demonstrate or explain each type of representation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Using function notation: \(J(1)=2\), \(J(2)=8\), \(J(3)=32\), \(J(4)=128\) where the input is the term number and the output is the value of the term
  </li>
<li>
    Using a table of inputs and outputs
  </li>
<li>
    Writing a recursive definition like \(J(1)=2\), \(J(n)=4J(n-1)\), \(n\geq2\)</li>
<li>
    Sketching a graph that includes the points \((1,2)\), \((2,8)\), \((3,32)\), \((4,128)\)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
