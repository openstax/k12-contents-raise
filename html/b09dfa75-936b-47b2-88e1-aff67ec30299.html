<p>In this lesson, you will reinforce your understanding of the different forms of a quadratic function and translate fluidly between them. When given a function&rsquo;s solutions, factored form, or standard form, you will be able to identify key information about the function.</p>
<p>You will understand what it means for two quadratic functions to be related. Given its solutions and one point, you will be able to specifically identify a specific quadratic function. You will use the skills you have learned to write a quadratic function satisfying the particular parameters given.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Find the standard form of a quadratic function given its zeros. </li>
  <li> Find the standard form of a quadratic function given its graph. </li>
  <li> Use the intercept form of a quadratic function to define a specific function given its zeros and a point. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
