<h3> Activity (10 minutes)</h3>
<br>
<h4> Launch</h4>
<p>Students study two stories characterized by different growth patterns and match expressions and tables with the two
  situations. The numbers in the two scenarios are identical, so students need to focus on the mathematical
  relationships and the operations in the expressions to successfully complete the activity. If students are evaluating
  the expressions, encourage them to reason about the operations without calculating anything.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here are verbal descriptions of two situations, followed by tables and expressions that could help answer one of the
  questions in the situations.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Situation 1: A person has 80 followers on social media. The number of followers triples each year. How many
    followers will she have after 4 years? </li>
  <li> Situation 2: A tank contains 80 gallons of water and is getting filled at a rate of 3 gallons per minute. How
    many gallons of water will be in the tank after 4 minutes? </li>
</ul>
<p>Use the descriptions of Situation 1 and Situation 2 to help you answer questions 1 &ndash; 6. Be prepared to explain
  how the table or expression answers the question.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Focus the discussion on how students went about matching the cards and the situations. Record students&rsquo;
  reasoning for all to see. In particular, highlight observations about common differences and common ratios. Ask
  questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Besides evaluating the expression, how could you tell (a certain expression) matched one of the
    situations?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How could you tell (a certain table) matched one of the situations?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How is the number of followers growing every 2 years?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How is the amount of water in the tank increasing every 2 minutes?&rdquo;</li>

    <p>Use this routine to support whole-class discussion. For each observation that is shared, ask students to restate
      what they heard using precise mathematical language. Consider providing students time to restate what they hear to a
      partner before selecting one or two students to share with the class. Ask the original speaker if their peer was
      accurately able to restate their thinking. Call students&rsquo; attention to any words or phrases that helped
      clarify the original statement. This provides more students with an opportunity to produce language as they
      interpret the reasoning of others.</p>

        That&rsquo;s correct! Check yourself: They started with 4 stores, and doubling means multiplying by 2 for

<br>
<p>To determine which options go with which scenario, you first need to analyze each scenario.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at Plan A.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li> Plan A is to open 20 new stores each year for a food company that currently has 5 convenience stores. In both
    scenarios, the initial value or starting point is 5 stores, which is why in each table the first value is \((0,5)\).
    If they are opening 20 additional stores each year, they are adding 20 stores to the total from the previous year.
    So in year 1 there would be 25 total stores, in year 2 there would be 45 total stores, and so on. These values are
    represented in option 6, so option 6 would represent Plan A. </li>
  <li> The mathematical expressions contain either multiplication or addition. Plan A is ADDING 20 stores a year, so
    year 5 could be represented as option 1 because it would be the initial number of stores plus 20 per year for 5
    years, or \(5 +20+20+20+20+20\).&nbsp; </li>
  <li> Option 5 is also added, and it represents Plan A since \(5 +20+20+20+20+20\) is the same as \(5+100\). </li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at Plan B.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Plan B would also start at 5, but it says to double the number of stores each year. Double means to MULTIPLY by
    2, so it would be \(5 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2\), which is option 3.&nbsp; </li>
  <li> Since \(5 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2\) can be simplified to \(5 \cdot 32\), option 2 also represents
    Plan B.</li>
  <li> Option 4 is the other table option, and as mentioned before, each table should have an initial value of 5 stores.
    Since Plan B is to double the number of stores, at the end of year 1 there should be 10 stores. When you check
    option 4, you can see that each term is double the term before. </li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore Plan A is options 1, 5, and 6, and Plan B is options 2, 3, and 4.</p>
<h4> Try It: Multiple Representations Verbal Scenario</h4>
<p>Represent the following scenario as a table and as two different mathematical expressions:</p>
<p>A tank contains 80 gallons of water and is getting filled at a rate of 3 gallons per minute. How many gallons of
  water will be in the tank after 4 minutes?</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to represent the scenario:</p>
<p>The table would record time in minutes and total water in gallons. The initial value is 80 gallons, so the first
  entry would be \((0,80)\) and each additional entry would be 3 more than the previous entry.</p>

<br>
<p>One mathematical expression would be 80 plus 3 repeated 4 times for the 4 minutes that passed, or \(80+3+3+3+3\).
  This could also be simplified to \(80+12\) or 92 gallons.</p>
