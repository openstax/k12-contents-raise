<p>How did you do? Take a moment to reflect on how many answers you got right and wrong on the previous pages. Did you complete the mini-lesson reviews? If not, completing these resources can help you get a better understanding of these concepts:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Write linear functions from a graph. </li>
  <li> Interpret linear functions. </li>
  <li> Evaluate exponential expressions. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are still struggling, be sure to reach out to your teacher for additional help. Nobody is good at problems like this the first try. Keep at it and it will get easier.</p>
