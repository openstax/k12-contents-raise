<p>In this lesson, you will learn how to explain the difference between an arithmetic and a geometric sequence. You will determine arithmetic sequences that will help you solve real-world problems, such as how much fuel is left in your vehicle or how fast the money in your bank account is increasing.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Explain what it means for a sequence to be arithmetic or geometric.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the<strong> activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
