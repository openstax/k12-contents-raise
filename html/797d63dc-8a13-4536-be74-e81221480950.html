<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>This is the first of several lessons in which students construct quadratic functions to represent various situations.
  Here they investigate the movement of free-falling objects. Students analyze the vertical distances that falling
  objects travel over time and see that they can be described by quadratic functions. They use tables, graphs, and
  equations to represent and make sense of the functions. In subsequent lessons, students build on the functions
  developed here to represent projectile motions, providing a context to develop understanding of the zeros, vertex, and
  domain of quadratic functions.</p>
<p>To express the relationship between distance and time, students need to see regularity in numerical values and
  express that regularity.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Explain (orally and in writing) the meaning of each term in a quadratic expression that represents the height of
    a free-falling object. </li>
  <li> Use tables, graphs, and equations to represent the height of a free-falling object. </li>
  <li> Write quadratic functions to represent the height of an object falling due to gravity. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Explain the meaning of the terms in a quadratic expression that represents the height of a falling object. </li>
  <li> Use tables, graphs, and equations to represent the height of a falling object. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are
  only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.
  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines. </p>
<ul>
  <li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and
    reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
  <li>A3(B) expand and internalize initial English vocabulary by learning and using high-frequency English words
    necessary for identifying and describing people, places, and objects, by retelling simple stories and basic
    information represented or supported by pictures, and by learning and using routine language needed for classroom
    communication </li>
  <li>A3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions</li>
  <li>A3(F) ask and give information ranging from using a very limited bank of high-frequency, high-need, concrete
    vocabulary, including key words and expressions needed for basic communication in academic and social contexts, to
    using abstract and content-based vocabulary during extended speaking assignments </li>
  <li>A3(H) narrate, describe, and explain with increasing specificity and detail as more English is acquired</li>
</ul>
