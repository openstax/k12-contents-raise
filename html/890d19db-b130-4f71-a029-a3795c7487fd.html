<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:
</p><br>
<ul>
  <li>Use graphing technology to graph linear equations and identify solutions to the equations.</li>
  <li>Explain how the coordinates of the points on the graph of a linear equation are related to the equation.</li>
  <li>Explain the meaning of points on a graph in terms of the situation it represents when given the graph of a linear equation.</li>
</ul><span>Here are the </span><strong>activities</strong><span> that helped you reach those goals:</span><br>
<ul>
  <li>1.5.1: Analyzing Graphs of Linear Equations&nbsp;
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you compared the characteristics of similar, yet different, graphs. In graphs, slopes, intercepts, axis labels, and where points are located can all create different meanings. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1.5.2: Graphing Linear Functions in Two Variables

      <li>1.5.2: Additional Resources </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1.5.3: Examining an Equation in Two Variables and Its Graph, Part 1
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you determined if a point was on the graph of a linear equation and what the meaning of that point was in a given situation </li>

      <li>1.5.3: Additional Resources&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1.5.4: Writing, Graphing, and Solving a Linear Equation
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you wrote equations, graphed the equations, and used the graph to help solve the equations and find the meaning of solutions. </li>
      <li>1.5.4: Self Check&nbsp;</li>
      <li>1.5.4: Additional Resources&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1.5.5: Examining an Equation in Two Variables and Its Graph, Part 2
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you wrote equations to express relationships. You also looked at graphs and determined the meaning of points on the graph to answer questions.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
