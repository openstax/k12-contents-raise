<h4>Introduction to Exponential Functions</h4>
<p>In this unit, your student is introduced to exponential relationships. Earlier, your student studied what mathematicians call linear relationships, where they start with a quantity and add or subtract the same amount repeatedly. In an exponential relationship, they start with a quantity and multiply by the same amount repeatedly.</p>

<p><strong>Here's an example of an exponential relationship:</strong></p>
<p>Exponential relationships are represented by equations in the form \(y =a\cdot b^x\), where \(a\) is the quantity you start with, \(b\) is the growth factor that you are going to multiply it by, and \(x\) is how many times you are going to multiply by \(b\). If \(b\) is greater than 1, the amount is growing and if \(b\) is less than 1 and greater than zero, the amount is shrinking. When \(b\) is equal to 1, the amount is staying the same.</p>
<p>If you start with 50 bees in your apiary (bee garden), and the number of bees doubles each year, how many bees would you have in 5 years? </p>

  <ul>
    <li>  Let \(y\) represent the number of bees and \(x\) represent time in years. </li>
<li>  The starting amount is 50 bees and the multiplier is 2.</li>
    <li>\(y =a \cdot b^x\)
    </li>
    <li>\(=50 \cdot 2^5\)</li>
    <li>\(=50 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2\)</li>
    <li>\(=1,600\) bees after 5 years</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Let's try it using a graph</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>While multiplication works well for a situation like this, where we are multiplying by 2 five times, a graph can be a useful tool. If you wanted to know how many bees you would have in 10 years, you could graph \(y=50 \cdot 2^x\) and see how many bees there are in 10 years.</li>
<li>Graphing is especially helpful when looking a long way into the future or when you want to know when something will happen, like when the bee population will reach 1 million.</li>
      </ul>

<p>Florida is having a problem with a toxic green algae that is floating on their waterways, contaminating the water and killing the marine life. Kiran lives on a small lake in south Florida. One day he noticed the algae floating on a 3 square meter area of the lake. A month later, the algae had doubled in size, growing to 6 square meters.</p>
<p><strong>Complete the following questions</strong></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>
    If the doubling pattern continues, how many square meters of the lake will be covered in algae in 4 months?
  </li>
  <li>
    If the surface area of the lake is about 1,500 square meters, after how many months will the entire lake be covered?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Hide the answers until you have attempted the questions
</strong></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>
    This can be solved using a variety of strategies. You could use a table, an equation, or a graph.<p>Let \(x\) represent the time in months and \(y\) represent the area in square meters. \(y=3\cdot 2^x\). Substitute 4 for \(x\)and solve for \(y\), which yields 48.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

    Just as with part A, there are several strategies for finding when the algae will cover the whole lake. 
    <ul>
      <li>Extending the graph, adding the graph of \(y=1,500\), and finding where they intersect is a nice way to find the month. </li>
      <li>In just under 9 months, the algae will cover 1,500 square meters of the lake.</li>
    </ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    Families can stay informed on concepts and vocabulary students are learning about in class.
  </li>
  <li>
    Families can watch with their students and pause at key points to predict what comes next or think up other examples of vocabulary terms.
