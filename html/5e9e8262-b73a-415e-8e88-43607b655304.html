<h4>Graph Linear Inequalities in Two Variables</h4>
<p>Now that we know what the graph of a linear inequality looks like and how it relates to a boundary equation we can use this knowledge to graph a given linear inequality.</p>
<p><strong>Example </strong><br>
  How to Graph a Linear Equation in Two Variables</p>
<p>Graph the linear inequality \( y &ge; \frac{3}{4} x &minus; 2 \).</p>
<p><b>Step 1.</b> Identify and graph the boundary line. </p>
<p> If the inequality is \(\leq\) or &gt;\(\geq\)
  boundary line is solid. </p>
<p>If the inequality is &lt; or &gt;, the boundary
  line is dashed. </p>
<p>Replace the
  inequality sign with an equal sign to find the boundary line</p>
<p>\(y=\frac34x-2.\)</p>
<p>The
  inequality sign is \(\geq\), so we draw a solid line.</p>

<p><b>Step 2.</b> Test a point that is not on the boundary line. Is it a solution of the
  inequality?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll test
  \((0,0)\).</p>
<p>Is it a solution
  of the inequality?</p>
<p>At \((0, 0)\),
  is \(y \geq \frac34x-2.\)?</p>
<p>\(0\overset?\geq\frac34(0)-2\)</p>
<p>\(0\geq-2\)</p>
<p>So, \((90,0)\)
  is a solution.</p>
<p><b>Step 3.</b> Shade in one side of the boundary line. </p>
<p>If the test point is a solution, shade in the side
  that includes the point. </p>
<p> If the test point is not a solution, shade in
  the opposite side. </p>
<p>The test
  point  \((0,0)\) is a solution to \(y\geq\frac34x-2.\)
  So we shade in that side.</p>

<p>All points in
  the shaded region and on the boundary line represent the solutions to \(y\geq\frac34x-2.\)</p>
