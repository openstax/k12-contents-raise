<h3>Warm Up (10 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm up familiarizes students with the different types of polynomials. Students will classify polynomials by number of terms and degree of exponent. Recognizing these differences will help students as they perform operations on polynomials of different types.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Review the new vocabulary defined at the start of the activity. After all the terms have been introduced, ask students to name a new polynomial of each type.</p>
<p>Arrange students into groups of 2. Have them complete the first activity sorting different types of polynomials and then answer the questions.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>A monomial is an algebraic expression with exactly one term: \(5x^2\)</p>
<p>A binomial is an algebraic expression with exactly two terms: \(5x^2 + 6y^3\)</p>
<p>A trinomial is an algebraic expression with exactly three terms: \(5x^2 + 6y^3 - 7c\)</p>
<p>Monomials, binomials, and trinomials are all different types of polynomials. A polynomial is a monomial or two or more monomials combined by addition or subtraction.</p>
<p>Working with your partner, use the following Desmos activity to sort the polynomials below. Then enter your answers below to check your understanding.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to write a polynomial of their own to share with their partner. Have their partner identify which type of polynomial it is and its degree.</p>
<p>Explain that identifying the type of polynomial and its degree will be important for determining how to perform different operations on them.</p>
