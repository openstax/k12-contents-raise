<p>The equivalent functions below model the height of a projectile in meters, \(t\) seconds after launch.</p>
<p>\(h(t)=-8t^2+27t+20\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;h(t)=(-8t&minus;5)(t&minus;4)\)</p>
<p>Without graphing, determine at what time the height of the object is 0 meters (when the object is on the ground).</p>
