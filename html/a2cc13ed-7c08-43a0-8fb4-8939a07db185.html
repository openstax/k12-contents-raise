<h4>Activity (25 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students work with rules of functions that arise from situations and continue to make connections
  between different representations of functions. They use rules to evaluate functions and interpret the input and
  output values in context. For instance, they see that \(B(1)\) represents the cost of using 1 gigabyte of data beyond
  the monthly allowance of Data Plan B, and find its value by computing \(10(1) + 25\).</p>
<p>Students also use rules of functions to solve for an unknown input value. For example, given the rule \(B(x)=10x +
  25\) and the statement \(B(x) = 50\), they work to find a value of \(x\) that makes \(B(x)=50\) true. They do so by:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>guessing and checking</li>
  <li>analyzing the graph of y=10x+25 and identifying the x-value when y is 50</li>
  <li>reasoning that a budget of $50 means that only $25 is available for extra data, and at $10 per gigabyte, it means
    2.5 gigabytes of data</li>
  <li>solving 10x+25=50 algebraically</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Identify students who use different strategies and ask them to share their thinking later.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2.</p>
<p>As a class, read the opening paragraphs and the first question in the activity statement. Ask students, "What do A(1)
  and B(1) represent in this situation? What does the 1 in each expression mean?" Give students a minute of quiet time
  to think individually and then time to discuss their thinking with their partner.</p>
<p>Invite students to share their interpretations, in particular the meaning of "allowance." Most data plans include a
  basic amount of data at a fixed cost but start charging an additional fee if usage goes beyond this allowance. Before
  students begin the activity, make sure they see that an input value of 1 represents usage of 1 gigabyte of data beyond
  the monthly allowance.</p>

  <h4>Student Activity</h4>
  <p>
    A college student is choosing between two data plans for her new cell phone. Both plans include an allowance of 2
    gigabytes of data per month. The monthly cost of each option can be seen as a function and represented with an
    equation:</p>
  <p>Option A: \(A(x)=60\)<br>
    Option B: \(B(x)=10x+25\)</p>
  <p>In each function, the input, x, represents the gigabytes of data used over the monthly allowance.</p>

  
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
    <!--Question 1 -->
    <li>
        What is the value of \(A(1)\)?
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> 60</p>
    </li>

    <!--Question 2 -->
    <li>
        What is the value of \(B(1)\)?
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> 35</p>
    </li>

    <!--Question 3 -->
    <li>
        Explain which data plan seems to be the best option for when 1 additional gigabyte of data is used.
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> If only 1 extra gigabyte is used, then Option B is the best option because it would be cheaper.</p>
    </li>
    <!--Question 4 -->

    <li>
        What is the value of \(A(7.5)\)?
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> 60<br>
            <em>Hint: \(A(7.5) = 60\)</em>
        </p>
    </li>

    <!--Question 5 -->
    <li>
        What is the value of \(B(7.5)\)?
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> 100<br>
            <em>Hint: \(B(7.5) = 10(7.5) + 25 = 100\)</em>
        </p>
    </li>



      <li>Explain which data plan seems to be the best option for when 7.5 additional gigabytes of data are used.

      <p><strong>Answer:</strong>If 7.5 extra gigabytes are used, then Option A is the best option because it would be cheaper.</p></li>


<!--Question 7 -->
    <li>
        Describe option A, \( A(x) = 60 \), in words.
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Option A charges a flat fee of $60 each month for any data used over 2 gigabytes. It doesn't matter how many gigabytes of data are used.</p>
    </li>

    <!--Question 8 -->
    <li>
        Describe option B, \( B(x) = 10x + 25 \), in words.
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Option B charges a $25 fee plus $10 for each gigabyte of data over the 2-gigabytes allowance.</p>
    </li>

<!--Question 9 -->
    <li>
        Use the Desmos graphing tool or technology outside the course. Graph each function on the same coordinate plane. Students are given a graph with \(x\)-axis ranging from -10 to 90 and \(y\)-axis ranging from -1 to 10. 
          

            <p><strong>Answer:</strong><br><img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/ecea9abe5d7c02d684e4e2973ed4413375b44533" heigt="450"></p>
    </li>


<!--Question 10 -->
    <li>
        Explain which plan you think she should choose.
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here are some samples: She should choose Option A if she plans on using around 7.5 gigabytes a month. She should choose Option A if she uses more than 5.5 gigabytes a month (or more than 3.5 gigabytes over the allowance). She should choose Option B if she uses only about 2 gigabytes a month.</p>
    </li>

<!--Question 11 -->
    <li>
        The student only budgeted $50 a month for her cell phone. She thought, “I wonder how many gigabytes of data I would have for $50 if I go with Option B?” and wrote \( B(x) = 50 \). How many additional gigabytes can the student use beyond the 2 allotted by the plan?
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> She can use 2.5 gigabytes beyond the initial 2 provided by the plan (for a total of 4.5 gigabytes each month).</p>
    </li>

<!--Question 12 -->
    <li>
        Explain how you knew how many gigabytes of data she would have for $50.
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here are some samples: I used the graph to estimate the gigabytes of data when the cost is $50, and it is about 2.5. I knew that \( B(x) \) is equal to \( 10x + 25 \), so I wrote \( 10x + 25 = 50 \) and solved for \( x \), which gave \( x = 2.5 \).</p>
    </li>




<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<strong>Are you ready for more?</strong>
<p>Describe a different data plan that, for any amount of data used, would cost no more than one of the given plans and
  no less than the other given plan. Explain or show how you know this data plan would meet these requirements.</p>
  <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Answer: </p>
<p>Here is a possible answer:</p>
<p>The graph of this data plan would be a line whose slope is between the slope of the other two graphs (greater than 0
  but less than 10) and goes through the intersection of the other two graphs.</p>
<p>The plan charges $4 for each gigabyte of data over the 2 gigabyte allowance, plus a $6 fee. With this plan:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If we use exactly 13.5 additional gigabytes above the allowance (that is, 5.5 gigabytes in total), all three plans
    would cost $60.</li>
  <li>If we use less than that, our plan would cost less than Option A but more than Option B.</li>
  <li>If we use more than that, our plan would cost more than Option A but less than Option B.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may question if A is a function at all, because unlike B or other function rules they have seen so far, A(x)
  is defined with a constant instead of an expression containing the dependent variable. Or they may wonder why A(x) has
  the same value no matter what the input value is. Ask students to recall the definition of function and to consider
  whether each input value gives only one output value. Because it does, even though it is always the same output value,
  A is still a function.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students to share their interpretations of the two data plans. Make sure students see that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The equation A(x)=60 tells us that, regardless of the extra gigabytes of data used, x, the cost, A(x) is always
    60.</li>
  <li>The 10x in the rule of B(x) tells us that each extra gigabyte of data used costs $10, and that there is a $25
    fixed fee.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Explain to students that the two functions here are linear functions because the output of each function changes at a
  constant rate relative to the input. Option B involves a rate of change of $10 per gigabyte of data over the monthly
  allowance, while Option A has a rate of change of $0 per gigabyte over the allowance.<br>
  Then, ask students how they went about graphing the functions. Students are likely to have plotted some input-output
  pairs of each function. If no students mention identifying the slope and vertical intercept of each graph, ask them
  about it.<br>
  Next, focus the discussion on students' response to the last question and how they found out the gigabytes of data
  that could be bought with $50 under Option B. Select previously identified students to share their strategies, in the
  order listed in the Activity Narrative. If no one mentions solving using a graph or solving 10x+ 25 = 50, bring these
  up.<br>
  Explain the following points to help students connect some key ideas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We can graph functions like A(x)=60 and B(x)=10x+25 without plotting individual coordinate pairs.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>A(x) is the output of function A and is represented by vertical values on a coordinate plane. The vertical
      values are typically labeled with the variable y, so we can write y=A(x) and graph y=60 to represent function A.
    </li>
    <li>Likewise, B(x) is the output of function B and is represented by vertical values on a plane. We can write y=B(x)
      and graph y=10x+25 to represent function B.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>To solve equations like B(x)=50 means to find one or more values of x that make the equation true. We can do this,
    among other ways, by using the graph of B and by solving an equation algebraically.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>On the graph of B, we can look for one or more values of x that correspond to the vertical value of 50. This
      might involve some estimating.</li>
    <li>Because B(x) is equal to 10x+25 and B(x) is also equal to 50, we can write 10x+25=50 and solve the equation.
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Comparing Function Values</h4>
<p>Functions are used in a variety of real life situations. They are useful in making comparisons, especially when
  comparing the cost.
  <br>
  Example:<br>
  The daily cost to printing company A to print a book is modeled by a function \(C(x)=3.25x+1500\) where C is the total
  daily cost, in dollars, and x is the number of books printed.
  <br>
  Their competitor, company B can print a book at a cost modeled by \(C(x)= 2.75x+2500\)
  <br>
  Find \(C(1000)\) for each company and make a statement about the result.
  <br>
  Company A: \(C(1000)=3.25(1000)+1500\) <br> \(C=4750\)
  <br>
  Company B: \(C(1000)=2.75(1000)+2500\) <br> \(C=5250\)
  <br>
  When 1000 books are printed, Company A has the best price.
</p>
<h4>Try It: Comparing Function Values</h4>

<p>The daily cost to manufacturing company A is modeled by the function
  \(C(x)=7.25x+2500\) where \(C(x)\) is the total daily cost and x is the number of items manufactured.
  <br>
  The daily cost to manufacturing company B is modeled by the function \(C(x)=8.5x +1500\).
  <br>
  Which company is less at \(C(1000)\)? Explain the meaning of the result.
