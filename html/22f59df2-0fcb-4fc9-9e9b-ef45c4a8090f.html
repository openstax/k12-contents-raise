<h4>Describing Domain and Range Graphs</h4>
<p>In a previous lesson, you explored the height, \(h\), of a bungee jumper at \(t\) seconds.</p>
<p><img alt="A graph.&nbsp;" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/45e09a83bdc5c7224223b36cc5540575fafd4bb2"></p>
<p>Assuming the jump ended at 35 seconds, what is the domain?</p>
<p>For domain, consider the \(x\)-values, so look from left to right.</p>
<p>The leftmost \(x\)-value is 0, and the rightmost \(x\)-value is 35.</p>
<p>The domain includes all the values from at least 0 up to and including 35 meters.</p>
<p>What are the values in the range?</p>
<p>For the range, consider the \(y\)-values, so look from bottom to top.</p>
<p>The lowest \(y\)-value is 10, and the highest \(y\)-value is about 75.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, the range includes all of the values from at least 10 up to about 75.</p>
<h4> Try It: Describing Domain and Range Graphs</h4>
<p>Describe the values of the domain and range using the graph below.</p>

<p>Your answers may vary, but here are some examples:<br>
</p>
<p>Here is how to find the domain and range values of this function:</p>
<p>For the domain, consider the \(x\)-values on the graph.</p>
<p>The domain includes all of the values from at least 0 through and including 3.2.</p>
<p>For the range, consider the \(y\)-values on the graph.</p>
<p>The range includes all of the values from at least 0 through and including 25.</p>
