<h4>Describing Domain and Range Graphs</h4>
<p>In a previous lesson, you explored the height, \(h\), of a bungee jumper at \(t\) seconds.</p>
<p><img alt="A graph showing height (h, in meters) versus time (t, in seconds). The curve starts high, then oscillates with decreasing and then steady amplitude as time increases." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/45e09a83bdc5c7224223b36cc5540575fafd4bb2"/></p>
<p>Assuming the jump ended at 35 seconds, what is the domain?</p>
<p>For domain, consider the \(x\)-values, so look from left to right.</p>
<p>The leftmost \(x\)-value is 0, and the rightmost \(x\)-value is 35.</p>
<p>The domain includes all the values from at least 0 up to and including 35 meters.</p>
<p>What are the values in the range?</p>
<p>For the range, consider the \(y\)-values, so look from bottom to top.</p>
<p>The lowest \(y\)-value is 10, and the highest \(y\)-value is about 75.Â </p>
<p>So, the range includes all of the values from at least 10 up to about 75.</p>

<p>Here is how to find the domain and range values of this function:</p>
<p>For the domain, consider the \(x\)-values on the graph.</p>
<p>The domain includes all of the values from at least 0 through and including 3.2.</p>
<p>For the range, consider the \(y\)-values on the graph.</p>
<p>The range includes all of the values from at least 0 through and including 25.</p>
