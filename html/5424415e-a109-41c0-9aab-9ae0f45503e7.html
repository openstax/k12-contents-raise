<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>Previously, students have characterized how functions are changing qualitatively, by describing them as increasing, staying constant, or decreasing in value. In earlier units and prior to this course, students have also computed and compared the slopes of line graphs and interpreted them in terms of rates of change. In this lesson, students learn to characterize changes in functions quantitatively, by using average rates of change.</p>
<p>Students learn that average rate of change can be used to measure how fast a function changes over a given interval. This can be done when we know the input-output pairs that mark the interval of interest or by estimating them from a graph.</p>
<p>Attention to units is important in computing or estimating average rates of change because units give meaning to how much the output quantity changes relative to the input. In thinking carefully about appropriate units to use, students practice attending to precision.</p>
<p>Students also engage in aspects of mathematical modeling when they use a data set or a graph to compute average rates of change and then use it to analyze a situation or make predictions.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Given a graph of a function, estimate or calculate the average rate of change over a specified interval.</li>
  <li>Recognize that the slope of a line joining two points on a graph of a function is the average rate of change.</li>
  <li>Understand that the average rate of change describes how fast the output of a function changes for every unit of change in the input.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Explain the meaning of the term &ldquo;average rate of change.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Estimate or calculate the average rate of change between two points from the graph of a function.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners
</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>ELPS 1(E) internalize new basic and academic language by using and reusing it in meaningful ways in speaking and writing activities that build concept and language attainment
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(C) speak using a variety of grammatical structures, sentence lengths, sentence types, and connecting words with increasing accuracy and ease as more English is acquired 
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions 
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(F) ask and give information ranging from using a very limited bank of high-frequency, high-need, concrete vocabulary, including key words and expressions needed for basic communication in academic and social contexts, to using abstract and content-based vocabulary during extended speaking assignments
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(G) express opinions, ideas, and feelings ranging from communicating single words and short phrases to participating in extended discussions on a variety of social and grade-appropriate academic topics 
  </li>
