<p>In this lesson, you will investigate how quantities that grow quadratically compare to those that grow exponentially. You will use different mathematical models to show the relationship between the functions to determine which one grows faster.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Explain using graphs, tables, or calculations how exponential functions eventually grow faster than quadratic functions. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
