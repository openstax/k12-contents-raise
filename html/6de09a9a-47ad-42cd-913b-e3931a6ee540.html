<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity prompts students to explore the parts of a radical as well as radicals with indexes above 2. Students
  may need a review of what an exponent does to a value, especially with negative numbers involved.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students into groups of 2.</p>
<br>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Work with a partner to discuss and answer the following questions.</p>

<p>The \(\sqrt a\), or square root of \(a\), is the same as \(\sqrt[2]a\). What about when we want to take roots that
  are higher than the square root? These are called <span>radicals</span>.</p>
<p>The nth root, or radical, is written \(\sqrt[n]a\). If \(b^n=a\), then \(b\) is an nth root of \(a\). The \(n\) is
  called the <span>index</span> of the radical. Just like \(\sqrt[2]n\) is called the square root, \(\sqrt[3]n\) is the
  cubed root, \(\sqrt[4]n\) is the fourth root, and so on. The number inside the radical is called the
  <span>radicand</span>.</p>

<p>Could we have an even root of a negative number? We know that the square root of a negative number is not a real
  number. The same is true for any even root. <em>Even</em> roots of negative numbers are not real numbers. <em>Odd</em>
  roots of negative numbers are real numbers.</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may have trouble with multiplication of the negative signs and the rules associated with it. If needed, add
  another column to the table for students in their notebook to allow them to expand each term to find the answer, and
  then take the root.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share how they arrived at their answers.</p>

<h4>Simplifying Radicals</h4>
<p><img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/71116f4837c799d5fae93c3319f60cabde089e6f" width="300">
</p>
<p>When simplifying <span>radicals</span>, think about which number will be used as a factor the number of times
  indicated by the <span>index</span> to get the number under the radical.</p>
<p>In the example above,</p>
<p>\(2\;\times\;2\;\times\;2=\;8\), so \(\sqrt[3]8\;=\;2\).</p>
<p>Remember, when the index is odd, the root is allowed to be negative. When the index is even, the root cannot be
  negative.</p>

<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to simplify a radical:</p>
<br>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Identify the index.<br>
  5</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Identify the radicand (inside the radical).<br>
  &ndash;32</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  What number can be used as a factor 5 times to get &ndash;32?<br>
  \((-2)\;\times\;(-2)\;\times\;(-2)\;\times\;(-2)\;\times\;(-2)=-32\)</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  Simplify.<br>
  \(\sqrt[5]{-32}\;=\;-2\)</p>
