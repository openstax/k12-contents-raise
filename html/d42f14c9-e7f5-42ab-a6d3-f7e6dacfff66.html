<h3>Project Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students analyze percentages of battery power as a device is being charged, generalize how the quantities are changing, and use their generalization to predict when the battery will be fully charged. The values in the table change at a roughly constant rate, so students are likely to choose a linear model, reason about the average rate of change (which they could do in different ways), and extend that rate of change to make their prediction.</p>
<p>Students apply their understanding of average rate of change and linear relationships to reason about the data and to make a prediction. If students choose to use graphing technology to help with their analysis, they practice choosing appropriate tools strategically.</p>
<p>One variation to consider as a follow-up to this activity or to the lesson is to ask students to collect their own data on charging time. This would increase the modeling demand. If students collect their own data, they may find out that batteries tend not to charge linearly all the way to 100%.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Use this routine to prepare students for the whole-class discussion. At the appropriate time, invite students to create a visual display showing their strategy and calculations. Allow students time to quietly circulate and analyze the work in at least 2 other displays in the room. Give students quiet think time to consider how the solution strategies are alike and how they are different. Next, ask students to find a partner to discuss what they noticed. Listen for and amplify observations that highlight the assumptions and choices that were made in each display. This will help students understand how variations in assumptions and choices may lead to different predictions and solution strategies.</p>

<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<p>A cell phone is plugged in to be charged. The table shows the percent of battery power at a few times after it was plugged in.</p>
<p>At what time will the battery be 100% charged?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the data to find out and Explain your reasoning.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Student Response</h4>
<p>For example: The phone should be fully charged around 12:45 p.m. At 11:40 a.m., it has 57% to go until fully charged. The phone charges about 9% every 10 minutes. At that rate, it will need more than six 10-minute periods or more than 60 minutes to reach 100%.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their predictions and explanations. Record and display for all to see the different assumptions and choices students made. If students claim that the battery was charging at 9% every 10 minutes, ask for their reasoning. If no students mentioned computing the average rate of change between 11:00 a.m. and 11:40 a.m., ask them about it.</p>
<p>If variations in students&rsquo; assumptions and choices led to different predictions, or if students used different representations in their reasoning, ask students to compare and contrast the different solution strategies:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are the solution strategies alike? How are they different?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How were the assumptions different?&rdquo;</p>
