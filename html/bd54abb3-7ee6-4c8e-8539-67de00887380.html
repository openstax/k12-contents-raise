<p>In this unit, you will learn more about quadratic equations. You will see that there are multiple methods to solving quadratic equations. In addition to completing the square, another method is the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is useful for solving quadratic equations that may not be conveniently solved by completing the square. It also provides a set formula method that can be used to solve any quadratic equation. Understanding how to use quadratic equations is important across many industries, from managing a business to engineering. For example, engineers use quadratic equations for designs that involve curved surfaces such as auto bodies, boats, or other vehicles.</p>
<h4>Building Character: Intellectual Humility</h4>
<p>In a business, such as The Ensemble Theatre, employees must learn from opposing views and have constructive discussions in their work. Similarly, in this course, you admit when you do not know or understand something and appreciate your classmates' and teachers' insights, and let them know when they raise a point that you hadn't considered. Many jobs require the ability to be willing to change your mind and let people know when you do.</p>
<p>Throughout this unit, you will work on developing your <strong>intellectual humility</strong>. When you approach life with intellectual humility, you open your mind to learning. You are able to learn from opposing views and have more constructive discussions, even when you disagree. No matter how old you are, with intellectual humility you become wiser. It helps you be less judgmental of others, learn more in school, and be a better leader.</p>
<p>Think about yourself. How many of these things are true?</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> I question my own opinions, positions, and viewpoints because they could be wrong. </li>
  <li> I reconsider my opinions when presented with new evidence. </li>
  <li> I recognize the value in opinions that are different from my own. </li>
  <li> I accept that my beliefs and attitudes may be wrong. </li>
  <li> In the face of conflicting evidence, I am open to changing my opinions. </li>
  <li> I like finding out new information that differs from what I already think is true. </li>
</ul>
<p>Don't worry if none of these statements are true for you. Developing this trait takes time. Your first step starts today!</p>
