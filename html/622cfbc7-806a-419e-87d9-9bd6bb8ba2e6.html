<p>A Mars rover collected the following temperature data over 1.6 Martian days. A Martian day is called a Sol. The graph below displays the air and ground temperatures in Celsius (\(y\)-axis) for specific times measured in Sols (\(x\)-axis). Which of the following is true about the comparison between ground temperature and air temperature?</p>
