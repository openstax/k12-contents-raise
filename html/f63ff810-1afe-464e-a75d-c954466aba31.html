<p>In this culminating project, you will integrate ideas from the unit by designing a fountain with given criteria. You will use the fact that the shape made by water coming out of a jet or fountain can be modeled with a quadratic equation. 
</p>
<p>In the first activity, you will work through a simplified example with one fountain and one jet. Then, you will think about what information is needed to write the equation and create a sketch to draw the path. Next, you will determine reasonable measurements to write the equation. Understanding the use of the vertex form of a quadratic equation will be helpful.
</p>
<p>The second activity gives you an opportunity to design a fountain with three to five jets. You will be given certain measurements and criteria to meet to write the equation for paths of the jets. When you are done, you will present your equations and an explanation of what information you used and how you wrote the equation of the path of the jets.
