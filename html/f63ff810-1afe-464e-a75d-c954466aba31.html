<h4>Activity P7.1: Introduction to Fountain Design</h4>
<p>The trapezoid represents the statue and the red dot is the location of the water jet.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    What would you need to know in order to write an equation for a path for the water that would make it go over the statue?
  </li>
  <li>
    What is a reasonable height of the statue and a reasonable distance from the jet to the statue?
  </li>
  <li>
    What strategy would you use to find the equation for the path of the water?
  </li>

<h4>Activity P7.2: Designing a Fountain</h4>
<p>A nearby park has a decorative pool, and the board of commissioners of the park is</p>
<p>considering installing water jets in the pool to make it into a fountain. They have asked you</p>
<p>to design the water jets. Here is a diagram of the pool from above:</p>
<p><img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/9e747d4c00e1e9d7559e11184081389afe59098d"/></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A and B are statues which are 4 feet tall.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    C and D are wider statues which are 5.5 feet tall.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    E is a statue with a vase on top, which is 8 feet tall.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    The pool is 15 feet wide.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The diagram is drawn to scale. The dots along the edge show where jets can be placed. You don&rsquo;t have to put jets in all five places. The jets will be at water level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will need to figure out how many jets there should be, where they should go, and what path the water should make. Your design needs to meet these criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The jets can only go in the places indicated by the dots.
  </li>
  <li>
    There must be at least two jets.
  </li>
  <li>
    The water can&rsquo;t hit any of the statues.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some water must go into the vase.
  </li>
  <li>
    The water can&rsquo;t go higher than 10 feet.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>When you have your final design, you should create a presentation to explain it to the commissioners. The presentation should show the paths of the water and include your mathematical descriptions of the paths.</p>
