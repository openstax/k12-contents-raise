  <p>Compare your answer:</p>
  <p>Between 150 cm and 180 cm. The rebound factors are \(\frac15\), \(\frac16\), and 0 (this last measurement is probably not reliable because it could have been a very small bounce height, which would be difficult to measure). Because \(\frac15\) of 150 is 30 and \(\frac16\) of 180 is 30, the ball was probably dropped from between 150 cm and 180 cm.</p>
