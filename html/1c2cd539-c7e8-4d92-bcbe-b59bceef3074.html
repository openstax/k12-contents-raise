<p dir="ltr"><span>In this lesson, you learned how to:</span><br></p>
<ul>
  <li>Use words and equations to describe the patterns in a table of values or in a set of calculations.</li>
  <li>Use representations, like diagrams and tables, to help make sense of a described situation and write equations for it.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1.3.1: Finding a Relationship between \( x \) and \( y \)<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you brainstormed ways to find the relationship between variables in a table.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1.3.2: Describing Relationships Using Words and Equations<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you matched tables with the equations that could model the relationships in each table.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1.3.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>
  <li>1.3.2: Additional Resources&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<li>1.3.3: Identifying and Representing Relationships<ul>
    <li>In this activity, you created tables from a situation and then wrote an equation to model the relationship.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>1.3.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>
<li>1.3.3: Additional Resources&nbsp;</li>

<li>1.3.4: Writing an Equation to Represent a Relationship<ul>
    <li>In this activity, you wrote an equation to model a relationship in a situation and also began to solve an equation given one of the quantities in the equation.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<p dir="ltr">After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
