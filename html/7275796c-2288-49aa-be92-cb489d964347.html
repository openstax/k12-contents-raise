<h4>Reading Exponential Graphs</h4>
<p>The graph below describes the amount of caffeine, \(c\),&nbsp;in a person&rsquo;s body \(t\)&nbsp;hours after an initial measurement of 100 mg.</p>

<p>What does the point \(c(10)=35\) mean?</p>
<p>After 10 hours, there is 35 mg of caffeine in a person&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>What is the value of \(t\) when \(c(t)=80\)?</p>
<p>When the caffeine concentration is 80 mg, time is 2 hours, so \(t=2\).</p>

<p>Here is how to interpret this exponential graph:</p>
<p>When \(t=5\), the curve crosses at 60, so \(c(5)=60\).</p>
<p>This means that after 5 hours, the person has 60 mg of caffeine in their body.</p>
