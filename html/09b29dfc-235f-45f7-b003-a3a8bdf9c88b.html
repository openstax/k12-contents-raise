<p>In this lesson, you will examine the meaning of negative exponents in the context of exponential growth and decay. Using data in a table, you will write equations and answer questions, some of which require working with negative values representing time. In one case, you will also produce a graph. As with many other activities in this unit, the mathematical work is grounded and interpreted in a context. These equations with negative exponents are frequently used in solving real-world problems where estimates are taken, including population sizes, financial calculations, and many other scientific measurements.</p>
<p>You will learn to convert numbers fluently between decimal form and scientific notation. This will allow you to easily perform operations on and represent large and small values in any context. Scientific notation is an extremely valuable tool for representing very large and small numbers that frequently occur as scientists take real-world measurements.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Describe the meaning of a negative exponent in equations that represent exponential growth and decay.
