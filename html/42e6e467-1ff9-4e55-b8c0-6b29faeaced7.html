<h3>Match a Description with a Graph</h3>
<p>A graph can be used to model a situation. You can use what you know about slope and \(y\)-intercept to connect the graphs to real situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>&nbsp;<img alt="A graph.&nbsp;" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c7fc88dc3b0da7a46a0c644e0c4786add867d9ee"><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> <img alt="horizontal axis, time in seconds. vertical axis, distance from home in meters." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/2279bed699a939618c7f75f3d6489b4b46794c20"><br>

</ol>
<p>Match each description with one of the graphs above:</p>

<p>1. Elena begins at home and runs away from her home at a constant rate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elena starts at home, so the graph must start at the origin. She moves away from home at a constant speed, so the graph must be a line that increases to the right. <strong>Graph B</strong> matches the description.</p>

<p>2. Clare begins her walk at school and walks home at a constant rate.</p>

<p>Clare starts at school, so the \(y\)-intercept is a point on the \(y\)-axis that shows the distance her home is from the school. She moves closer to home at a constant speed, so the graph must be a line that decreases to the right. <strong>Graph C</strong> matches the description.&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. Lin begins at home and runs away from home, and then walks for a while.</p>

<p>Lin starts at home, so the graph must start at the origin. She starts running and then walks, so the graph is a line with a slope that starts off steep and then continues with a less steep slope. <strong>Graph A</strong> matches the description.</p>

<ol start="3">
  <li aria-level="1">
    <p role="presentation">Lin begins at home and runs away from home, and then walks for a while.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Lin starts at home, so the graph must start at the origin. She starts running and then walks, so the graph is a line with a slope that starts off steep and then continues with a less steep slope. Graph A matches the description.</p>

<p>Describe the graph. You can use the wording from the previous problem as a guide.</p>

<div class="os-raise-ib-content" data-schema-version="1.0" data-wait-for-event="Reveal1">
  <p>Here is how to describe the graph:</p>
  <p>The graph starts at the origin, so the walker starts at home. The line is increasing, so the walker is moving at a constant speed away from home. Then the line decreases at a constant rate, so the walker is moving at a constant rate toward home.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Here is a possible description:</p>
  <p>Lin begins at home and walks away from home for a while, and then she walks back home.</p>

    <div class="os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response">
      <p>Correct! The y-intercept shows that he starts at a distance from home and moves at a constant rate to home. Then he walks away from home.</p>

    <div class="os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response" data-answer="Max begins at home and walks away from home for a while, then walks back home.">
      <p>Incorrect. Let's try again a different way: This description would match a graph of a line that starts at the origin and has a positive slope and then the line changes slope and decreases. The graph shows he starts at a distance away from home, moves to home and then away from home. The correct answer is Max begins his walk at the library, walks home at a constant rate, and then walks away from home.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response" data-answer="Max begins his walk at the library and walks away from home at a constant rate.">
      <p>Incorrect. Let’s try again a different way: This description matches a graph with a positive slope. The graph starts with a negative slope as Max walks home. Then, the graph shows a line with a positive slope to show he walks away from home.  
        The correct answer is Max begins his walk at the library, walks home at a constant rate, and then walks away from home.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response" data-answer="Max begins his walk at the library and walks home at a constant rate.">
      <p>Incorrect. Let’s try again a different way: This description matches the first part of the graph. However, the graph shows a line with a positive slope to show Max walks away from home.  The correct answer is Max begins his walk at the library, walks home at a constant rate, and then walks away from home.
