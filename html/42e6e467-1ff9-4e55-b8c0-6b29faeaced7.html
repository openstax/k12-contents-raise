<h3>Match a Description with a Graph</h3>
<p>A graph can be used to model a situation. You can use what you know about slope and \(y\)-intercept to connect the graphs to real situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>&nbsp;<img alt="A graph.&nbsp;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/im-ims-export/ZnAkBiZLLHevAL32XWdBfGuW"><br>
<br>
</li>
<li> <img alt="horizontal axis, time in seconds. vertical axis, distance from home in meters." src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/im-ims-export/CLvGC3dCyx77XUWQjcRoDfqX"><br>
<br>
</li>
<li> <img alt="horizontal axis, time in seconds. vertical axis, distance from home in meters." src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/im-ims-export/4XRdh3es5MhtQEPQ8Kk6bCtQ"></li>
</ol>
<p>Match each description with one of the graphs above:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">
<p role="presentation">Elena begins at home and runs away from her home at a constant rate.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Elena starts at home, so the graph must start at the origin. She moves away from home at a constant speed, so the graph must be a line that increases to the right. Graph B matches the description.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li aria-level="1">
<p role="presentation">Clare begins her walk at school and walks home at a constant rate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Clare starts at school, so the \(y\)-intercept is a point on the \(y\)-axis that shows the distance her home is from the school. She moves closer to home at a constant speed, so the graph must be a line that decreases to the right. Graph C matches the description.&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li aria-level="1">
<p role="presentation">Lin begins at home and runs away from home, and then walks for a while.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Lin starts at home, so the graph must start at the origin. She starts running and then walks, so the graph is a line with a slope that starts off steep and then continues with a less steep slope. Graph A matches the description.</p>

<p>Describe the graph. You can use the wording from the previous problem as a guide.</p>

<div class="os-raise-ib-content" data-schema-version="1.0" data-wait-for-event="Reveal1">
<p>Here is how to describe the graph:</p>
<p>The graph starts at the origin, so the walker starts at home. The line is increasing, so the walker is moving at a constant speed away from home. Then the line decreases at a constant rate, so the walker is moving at a constant rate toward home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a possible description:</p>
<p>Lin begins at home and walks away from home for a while, and then she walks back home.</p>

<p>Correct! The y-intercept shows that he starts at a distance from home and moves at a constant rate to home. Then he walks away from home.</p>

<p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way.</p>
