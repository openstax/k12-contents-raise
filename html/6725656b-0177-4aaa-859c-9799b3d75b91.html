<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Explain the meaning of the intercepts on a graph of a quadratic function in terms of the situation it represents. </li>
  <li> Explain how the numbers in the factored form of a quadratic expression relate to the intercepts of its graph. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the<strong> activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 7.10.1: Graphs of Linear Equations </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you located the \(x\)- and \(y\)-intercepts of linear graphs. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 7.10.2: Quadratic Forms and Their Graphs </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you looked at different forms of a quadratic and their graphs and picked out characteristics. These characteristics included \(x\)- and \(y\)-intercepts. </li>
    <li> 7.10.2: Self-Check </li>
    <li> 7.10.2: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 7.10.3: The \(X\)- and \(Y\)-Intercepts of Quadratic Expressions </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you continued looking at different forms and graphs of quadratics and identifying their intercepts. You then made observations about how the graphs and forms are related in helping identify intercepts. </li>
    <li> 7.10.3: Self Check </li>
    <li> 7.10.3: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 7.10.4: Using the Standard Form of an Equation to Find the \(X\)- and \(Y\)-Intercepts </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you used the standard form of a quadratic equation to find the \(y\)-intercept and the factored form of the same equation to find the \(x\)-intercepts. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following<strong> practice:</strong></p>
