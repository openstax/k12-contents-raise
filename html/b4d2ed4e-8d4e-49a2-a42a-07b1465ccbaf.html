<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity further develops students&rsquo; ability to distinguish a quadratic function and to articulate that distinction. Given a pattern of squares, students critique a statement about how the pattern is changing and make a case for whether two given equations both represent the same pattern. They notice that an expression without a squared term, for example, \(n(n+2)\), can also be a quadratic expression. Along the way, students practice constructing logical arguments and supporting them.</p>
<p>As students discuss the first question, look for those who can explain that the given pattern is not linear because the number of squares does not increase by equal numbers over equal intervals.</p>
<p>As they discuss the second question, identify students who:</p>
<ul>
  <li> understand that applying the distributive property to \(n(n+2)\) gives \(n^2+2n\).</li>
  <li> can show this equivalence visually: by marking the side length of each rectangle with \(n\) and \(n+2\) and by showing the \(n\) by \(n\) square plus \(2\)-by-\(n\) rectangle in each rectangle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask these students to share their explanations during whole-class discussion.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Give students quiet work time and then time to share their work with a partner.</p>

  <li> Sketch the next step in the pattern. Explain what you sketched. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer: </strong>Step 4 is a 4-by-6 rectangle.

  <li> Kiran says that the pattern is growing linearly because as the step number goes up by 1, the number of rows and the number of columns also increase by 1. Do you agree? Be prepared to show your reasoning. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer: </strong>Kiran is correct that the number of rows and the number of columns each grow by 1, but the total number of squares does not increase by the same amount from step to step. So, the total number of squares does not grow linearly.
  </li>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li> To represent the number of squares after \(n\) steps, Diego and Jada wrote different equations. Diego wrote the equation \(f(n)=n(n+2)\). Jada wrote the equation \(f(n)=n^2+2n\). Is either Diego or Jada correct? Be prepared to show your reasoning. </li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Diego&rsquo;s expression \(n(n+2)\) is correct because there are \(n\) columns and \(n+2\) rows of small squares in Step \(n\). Jada&rsquo;s expression is also correct because the \(n(n+2)\) array of small squares can be divided into an \(n\)-by-\(n\) square (having \(n^2\) small squares) and an \(n\)-by-2 rectangle (having \(2n\) small squares).</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Briefly discuss students&rsquo; sketches for Step 4. Then, select students to present their explanations of the second question. Make sure students see that when both the length and the width of the rectangle grow at each step, the increase in the number of squares (or in area) from one step to the next is no longer constant, so the growth is not linear.</p>
<p>For the last question, if no students reason about the equivalence of the two expressions visually, demonstrate it. Take the diagram for any step number and show where the \(n^2\) and \(2n\) are, and then show where the \(n\) and \((n+2)\) are. Emphasize that because they both represent the same quantity, the expressions \(n^2+2n\) and \(n(n+2)\) must be equivalent.</p>
<p>If not already mentioned by students, point out that we can also see that these expressions are equivalent without using the picture by applying the Distributive Property, which gives \(n(n+2)=n^2+2n\). In other words, both expressions define the same function. This means that \(n(n+2)\) is also a quadratic expression even though it does not have a squared term.</p>

<p>There would be \((n+1)(n+1)\) squares, but there are 2 missing from each step, so the equation would be:</p>
<p>\(y=(n+1)^2-2\).</p>
