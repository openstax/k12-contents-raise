<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity further develops students’ ability to distinguish a quadratic function and to articulate that
  distinction. Given a pattern of squares, students critique a statement about how the pattern is changing and make a
  case for whether two given equations both represent the same pattern. They notice that an expression without a squared
  term, for example, \(n(n+2)\), can also be a quadratic expression. Along the way, students practice constructing
  logical arguments and supporting them.</p>
<p>As students discuss the first question, look for those who can explain that the given pattern is not linear because
  the number of squares does not increase by equal numbers over equal intervals.</p>
<p>As they discuss the second question, identify students who:</p>
<ul>
<li> understand that applying the distributive property to \(n(n+2)\) gives \(n^2+2n\).</li>
<li> can show this equivalence visually: by marking the side length of each rectangle with \(n\) and \(n+2\) and by
    showing the \(n\) by \(n\) square plus \(2\)-by-\(n\) rectangle in each rectangle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask these students to share their explanations during whole-class discussion.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Give students quiet work time and then time to share their work with a partner.

<li> Sketch the next step in the pattern. Explain what you sketched. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Answer: </strong>Step 4 is a 4-by-6 rectangle.

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li> Kiran says that the pattern is growing linearly because as the step number goes up by 1, the number of rows and
    the number of columns also increase by 1. Do you agree? Be prepared to show your reasoning. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Answer: </strong>Kiran is correct that the number of rows and the number of columns each grow by 1, but the
    total number of squares does not increase by the same amount from step to step. So, the total number of squares does
    not grow linearly.
  </li>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
<li> To represent the number of squares after \(n\) steps, Diego and Jada wrote different equations. Diego wrote the
    equation \(f(n)=n(n+2)\). Jada wrote the equation \(f(n)=n^2+2n\). Is either Diego or Jada correct? Be prepared to
    show your reasoning. </li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Diego’s expression \(n(n+2)\) is correct because there are \(n\) columns and \(n+2\)
  rows of small squares in Step \(n\). Jada’s expression is also correct because the \(n(n+2)\) array of small
  squares can be divided into an \(n\)-by-\(n\) square (having \(n^2\) small squares) and an \(n\)-by-2 rectangle
  (having \(2n\) small squares).</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Briefly discuss students’ sketches for Step 4. Then, select students to present their explanations of the
  second question. Make sure students see that when both the length and the width of the rectangle grow at each step,
  the increase in the number of squares (or in area) from one step to the next is no longer constant, so the growth is
  not linear.</p>
<p>For the last question, if no students reason about the equivalence of the two expressions visually, demonstrate it.
  Take the diagram for any step number and show where the \(n^2\) and \(2n\) are, and then show where the \(n\) and
  \((n+2)\) are. Emphasize that because they both represent the same quantity, the expressions \(n^2+2n\) and \(n(n+2)\)
  must be equivalent.</p>
<p>If not already mentioned by students, point out that we can also see that these expressions are equivalent without
  using the picture by applying the Distributive Property, which gives \(n(n+2)=n^2+2n\). In other words, both
  expressions define the same function. This means that \(n(n+2)\) is also a quadratic expression even though it does
  not have a squared term.</p>

        That’s correct! Check yourself: There are \(n+1\) rows and \(n\) columns. The number of blocks in each
        step would be \(n(n+1)\), which equals \(n^2+n\).

        Incorrect. Let’s try again a different way: The number of rows is \(n+1\), and the number of columns is
        \(n\). Be sure to distribute the \(n\) to both terms when multiplying. The answer is \(y=n^2+n\).

<h4>More Complex Quadratic Patterns</h4>
<p>See Steps 1 – 3 of a pattern of squares below. Write an equation representing the relationship between the step
  number \(n\) and the number of squares \(y\).</p>
<p><img alt="A pattern of squares. Step 1 has two columns of squares in two rows, but there are only two squares. In the first column, the square is located in the top row. In the second column, the square is located in the bottom row. It makes the squares look like they are in a diagonal pattern with the bottom left square and the top right square missing. Step 2 has 3 columns of squares. In the first column, there are 2 squares. In the second column, there are 3 squares. The squares are aligned to the top of the squares in the previous column so it looks like a square is missing from the first column. Then, in the last column, there are only 2 squares. The squares in this last column align to the bottom of the squares in the previous column so it looks like there is a square missing from the top of the column. Step 3 has 4 columns of squares. The first column contains 3 squares and the next two columns contain 4 squares. The columns are arranged such that they all start at the same level so it looks like a square is missing from the first column. Then, in the last column there are 3 squares. The squares in this column align with the bottom of the previous two columns so it looks like there is a square missing from the top of the column." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="106" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/0e7561018baf1cc33887cea2b04dfb9eb48001fb" width="300"/></p>
<p>First, try to find the pattern if the missing squares were actually there.</p>
<p>Make a table:</p>

<br/>
<p>There would be \((n+1)(n+1)\) squares, but there are 2 missing from each step, so the equation would be:</p>
<p>\(y=(n+1)^2-2\).</p>
