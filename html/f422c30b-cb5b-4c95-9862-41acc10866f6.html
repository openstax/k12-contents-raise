<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students generate two geometric sequences from a mathematical situation. The purpose is to create
  representations of geometric sequences using tables and graphs. At this time, students do not need to write equations
  for the situation since that work will be the focus of a future lesson.</p>
<p>Monitor for students sketching neat and accurate graphs to highlight during the whole-class discussion. Note that
  future lessons will focus on a reasonable domain for sequences when regarded as functions. In this activity, students
  may "connect the dots" in the graphs with lines, but it's not crucial to address at this time whether or not that's a
  sensible thing to do.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Invite them to read the introduction to the task. If time allows, distribute
  scissors and blank paper and let students work with their partner to carry out the paper cutting while completing the
  first few rows of the table. If time is limited, conduct a demonstration of the paper cutting.</p>
<p>Tell students to pause after completing the first few rows of the table and then ask,</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    "What happens to the number of pieces after each cut?"
  </li>
  <li>
    "What happens to the area of each piece after each cut?"
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Ask students to share their responses with a partner, and then invite a few groups to share their response with the
  class. Ensure students can articulate that as a result of a cut, the number of pieces doubles, and the area of each
  piece is halved. Students then proceed with the remainder of the activity.</p>

  <h5> Support for English Language Learners</h5>
  <p>Use this routine to help students consider the context of this problem. Without revealing the questions that
    follow, display and read aloud only the task statement that describes Clare's actions. Ask students to write down
    possible mathematical questions that could be asked about the situation. Invite 3-4 students to share their
    questions with the class. Listen for and amplify any questions that include language related to looking for
    patterns.</p>

  <h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>
  <p>Use this routine to help students consider the Engagement: Provide Access by Recruiting Interest. Begin with a
    whole-class demonstration. If time does not allow for students to carry out paper cutting themselves, demonstrate
    the initial cuts so that students can complete the first few rows of the table.</p>

<h4>Student Activity </h4>
<p>Clare takes a piece of paper, cuts it in half, then stacks the pieces. She takes the stack of two pieces, then cuts
  in half again to form four pieces, stacking them. She keeps repeating the process.</p>

  <li>
    Why is the product of the number of pieces and the area of each piece always the same? Explain how you know.
  </li>
  <p> <strong>ANSWER: </strong>
    Sample explanation: It's always the same because adding up the area of the little pieces of paper gives the area of
    the original sheet of paper.
  </p>
</ol>
<h4> Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>If students struggle to remember the meaning of area, ask them what they remember about the idea from their previous
  courses. A workable definition is "the number of one-inch squares covered by the piece of paper." (Length times width
  is how one computes the area of the region bounded by a rectangle, but it doesn't explain what area means.)</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>The goal of this discussion is for students to identify the common ratio for each sequence and learn that sequences
  with a common ratio are called geometric sequences.</p>
<p>Invite previously identified students to share their graphs with the class. Display the two sequences in this
  activity (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 2.5) for all to see.</p>
<p>Here are some possible questions for discussion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    "When did you stop cutting the paper and complete the table using a pattern?"
  </li>
  <li>
    "What was the pattern you noticed?" (To find the number of pieces, multiply the previous number by 2. To find the
    area, multiply the previous number by \(\frac12\).)
  </li>
  <li>
    "How did you find the results after six cuts?" (Multiply 32 by 2 to get 64, and divide 2.5 by 2 to get 1.25.)
  </li>
  <li>
    "What is the common ratio for each sequence?" (It's 2 for the number of pieces and&nbsp; \(\frac12\).)
  </li>
  <li>
    "How can you see the common ratio in each graph?" (For the number of pieces, the height of each plotted point is
    twice the height of the previous plotted point. For the area, the height of each plotted point is half the height of
    the previous plotted point.)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell students that the sequences they have seen today (in this activity and in the warm-up) have a special name:
  geometric sequences. Geometric sequences are characterized by a common ratio. In a geometric sequence if you divide
  any term by the previous term, you always get the same value: the common ratio for the sequence. Reiterate that the
  common ratio for the area sequence is&nbsp; \(\frac12 \) because it's what you multiply by to get the next term.</p>
<p>Some students may notice the similarity between a geometric sequence and an exponential function. Invite these
  students to share their observations, such as how both are defined by a common ratio. Tell students that geometric
  sequences are a type of exponential function and that their knowledge of exponential functions will help them describe
  geometric sequences during this unit. If students do not bring up the connection to exponential functions, ask "What
  do you remember about exponential functions?" Record student responses for all to see and invite comparisons between
  exponential functions and geometric sequences.</p>
