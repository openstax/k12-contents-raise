<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<p>An art museum opens at 9 a.m. and closes at 5 p.m. The function \(V\) gives the number of visitors in the museum \(h\) hours after it opens.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Explain what this statement tells us about the situation: \(V(1.25) = 28\).</li>
  <li>Use function notation to represent each statement:</li>
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
    <li>At 1 p.m., there were 257 visitors in the museum.</li>
    <li>At the time of closing, there were no visitors in the museum.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Use the previous statements about the visitors in the museum to sketch a graph that could represent the function.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<ol>
  <li>An hour and 15 minutes after the museum opened (at 10:15 a.m.), there were 28 visitors in the building.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
    <li>\(V(4)=257\)</li>
    <li>\(V(8)=0\)</li>
  </ol>
  <li>A graph showing points at \((1.25,28)\) and \((4,257)\), with or without lines connecting these points. See sample graph.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
