<h4>Solving Equations and Creating Equivalent Equations</h4>
<p>One way to create equivalent equations is to solve the equation. In each step of solving, an equivalent equation is created.</p>
<p>Here is a general strategy for solving linear equations:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 - </strong>Simplify each side of the equation as much as possible.<br></p>
<p>Use the Distributive Property to remove any parentheses.<br>
Combine like terms.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Collect all the variable terms on one side of the equation.<br></p>
<p>Use the Addition or Subtraction Property of Equality.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 - </strong> Collect all the constant terms on the other side of the equation.<br></p>
<p>Use the Addition or Subtraction Property of Equality.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 - </strong>Make the coefficient of the variable term equal to 1.<br></p>
<p>Use the Multiplication or Division Property of Equality.<br>
State the solution to the equation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 - </strong>Check the solution.<br></p>
<p>Substitute the solution into the original equation to make sure the result is a true statement.</p>
<br>

<p>Here is an example of solving equations. Notice that each step is an acceptable move that creates an equivalent equation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 - </strong>Simplify each side of the equation as much as possible.<br></p>
<p>Use the Distributive Property to remove any parentheses.<br>

<p>\(\begin{aligned}-6(x+3) &amp;=24 \\ -6x-18 &amp;=24 \end{aligned}\)<br></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Collect all the variable terms on one side of the equation.<br></p>
<p>Nothing to do. All the variables of \(x\) are on the left side.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 - </strong> Collect all the constant terms on the other side of the equation.<br></p>
<p>Use the Addition or Subtraction Property of Equality.<br>
<p>\(\begin{aligned}-6x-18 {\style{color:red}+} {\style{color:red}1}{\style{color:red}8}&amp;=24 {\style{color:red}+} {\style{color:red}1}{\style{color:red}8} \\ -6x &amp;=42\end{aligned}\)<br></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 - </strong>Make the coefficient of the variable term equal to 1.<br></p>
<p>Use the Multiplication or Division Property of Equality.<br>
  <p>\(\begin{aligned}\frac{-6x}{6} &amp;=\frac{42}{-6} \\ x &amp;=7 \end{aligned}\)<br></p>
<p><strong>Step 5 - </strong>Check the solution.<br></p>
<p>Substitute the solution into the original equation to make sure the result is a true statement.<br></p>
<p>\(\begin{aligned}-6(x+3) &amp;=24 \\ -6({\style{color:red}-}{\style{color:red}7}+3) &amp;=24 \\ -6(-4) &amp;=24 \\24 &amp;=24 \end{aligned}\)<br></p>

The second column contains further written instructions. The third column contains math. On the top row of the table, the first cell on the left reads: &ldquo;Step 1. Simplify each side of the equation as much as possible.&rdquo; The text in the second cell reads: &ldquo;Use the Distributive Property. Notice that each side of the equation is simplified as much as possible.&rdquo; The third cell contains the equation negative 6 times x plus 3, where x plus 3 is in parentheses, equals 24.
