<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>This opening warm-up gives students an opportunity to create a pictorial representation of exponential growth. The purpose of this warm-up is to help students make sense of the situation coming up in the next activity, where they are not explicitly asked to make a pictorial representation.</p>

<p>There are some bacteria in a dish. Every hour, each bacterium splits into 3 bacteria.</p>
<ol>
  <li> This diagram shows a bacterium in hour 0 and then hour 1. Draw what happens in hours 2 and 3. </li>
  <p><img alt="The picture shows 1 bacterium (an irregular polygon with a double outline and light blue inside) for hour 0, then an arrow to the right, then 3 bacteria for hour 1." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/3b0c4f4a934fc485c117e8f9697531ab47731d55" width="550"><br>

  <br>
  <li> How many bacteria are there in hour 2? <br><br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> 9 bacteria in hour 2
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> How many bacteria are there in hour 3? <br><br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> 27 bacteria in hour 3
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite a few students to share their drawings and their observations about how the number of bacteria is growing.</p>
