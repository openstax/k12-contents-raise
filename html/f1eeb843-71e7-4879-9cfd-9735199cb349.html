<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>If \( y \) varies directly as \( x \) and \( y=14 \),&ZeroWidthSpace; when \( x=3 \). find the equation that relates \( x \) and \( y \). </li></ol>
      <ul>
        <li>  \(x=\frac{14}3y\)  </li>
        <li>  \(y=\frac3{14}x\)  </li>
        <li> \(3x=14y\) </li>
        <li>\(y=\frac{14}3x\)</li>
      </ul>

  <li>The price, \( P \), that Eric pays for gas varies directly with the number of gallons, \( g \), he buys. It costs him $50 to buy 20 gallons of gas.</li></ol>
    <p> Choose
        the equation that relates \(P\) and \(g\). </p>
    <ul>
      <li>\(P=2.5g\)</li>
      <li>\(P=\frac{2.5}g\)</li>
      <li>\(g=\frac{2.5}P\)</li>
      <li>\(P=\frac g{2.5}\)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; \(P= 2.5g\)</p>

  <li>Joseph is traveling on a road trip. The distance, \( d \), he travels before stopping for lunch varies directly with the speed, \( v \), he travels. He can travel 120 miles at a speed of 60 mph. 
	  <p>How many miles would he travel before stopping for lunch at a rate of 65 mph? Only enter integers.</p>
	  
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>130</p></li>
		
  <li>The mass of a liquid, \( M \), varies directly with its volume, \( V \). A liquid with mass 16 kilograms has a volume of 2 liters.&nbsp;<p> What is the volume, in liters, of this liquid if its mass is 128 kilograms?</p>
	  
	  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>16 </p>
  </li>
  <li>The length, \( L \), that a spring stretches varies directly with a weight, \( W \), placed at the end of the spring. When Sarah placed a 10-pound watermelon on a hanging scale, the spring stretched 5 inches.<p> What weight of watermelon, in pounds, would stretch the spring 6 inches? </p> 
	  
	  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> 1 2</p></li>
		
  <li>The maximum load a beam, \( M \), will support varies directly with the square of the diagonal of the beam&rsquo;s cross-section, \( d^2 \). A beam with diagonal 6 inch will support a maximum load of 108 pounds.&nbsp;<p> What
        load, in pounds, will a beam with a 10-inch diagonal support? </p>
	  
    <p><strong>Answer: </strong>300</p>
