  <li>Joseph is traveling on a road trip. The distance, \( d \), he travels before stopping for lunch varies directly with the speed, \( v \), he travels. He can travel 120 miles at a speed of 60 mph. How
    many miles would he travel before stopping for lunch at a rate of 65 mph? <strong>Only enter integers.<br><br>ANSWER:</strong><span> 130<br><br><br></span></li>
  <li>The mass of a liquid, \( M \), varies directly with its volume, \( V \). A liquid with mass 16 kilograms has a volume of 2 liters.&nbsp;<p><span lang="EN">What
        is the volume, in liters, of this liquid if its mass is 128 kilograms? <strong>Enter integers only.<br></strong></span><strong><br>ANSWER:&nbsp; </strong><span>16</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>The length, \( L \), that a spring stretches varies directly with a weight, \( W \), placed at the end of the spring. When Sarah placed a 10-pound watermelon on a hanging scale, the spring stretched 5 inches.<p><span lang="EN">What
        weight of watermelon, in pounds, would stretch the spring 6 inches? <strong>Enter integers only</strong>.</span></p><span><strong>ANSWER: </strong>1</span>2<br><br><br></li>
  <li>The maximum load a beam, \( M \), will support varies directly with the square of the diagonal of the beam&rsquo;s cross-section, \( d^2 \). A beam with diagonal 6 inch will support a maximum load of 108 pounds.&nbsp;<p><span lang="EN">What
        load, in pounds, will a beam with a 10-inch diagonal support?<strong> Enter integers only.</strong></span></p>
    <p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>300<br><br></p>
