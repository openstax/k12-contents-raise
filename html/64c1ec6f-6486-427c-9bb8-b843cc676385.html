<h4>Warm Up Activity</h4><br>
<p><span>Here is a table of values. The two quantities, \( x \)&nbsp;and \(y \), are related.</span></p>
<table class="os-raise-skinnytable">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">\( x \)</th>
      <th scope="col">\( y \)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>\(1\)</td>
      <td>\(0\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\(3\)</td>
      <td>\(8\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\(5\)</td>
      <td>\(24\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\(7\)</td>
      <td>\(48\)</td>
    </tr>

<p>What are some strategies you could use to find a relationship between \( x \)&nbsp;and \(y \)? Brainstorm as many
  ways as possible.</p>

    <p>Your answer may vary, but here are some samples</p>
    <ul>
      <li>See if there is an operation that could be done to \( x \) that would produce \( y \).</li>
      <li>Compare how the \( x \)-values change and the \( y \)-values change, and see if there is a pattern.</li>
      <li>See if the numbers in one column follow a special pattern and if that pattern could be connected to the
        numbers in the other column.</li>
      <li>Plot the \( x \)- and \( y \)-values on a coordinate plane and see if the graph looks like a familiar
        relationship.</li>
