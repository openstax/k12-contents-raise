<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Examine the three graphs representing three exponential functions: \(f\), \(g\), and \(h\).</p>
<p><img alt="Line graph showing three upward-curving lines labeled a (blue), b (green), and c (orange) on axes labeled x (horizontal) and y (vertical), with values increasing rapidly as x increases. h and g intersect on the y-axis and f is below both of them with a wider curve.   h is a steeper curve than g.   The lines are h, g, and then f across the graph." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c91699a5862502edaffc0fc9cafd5d89472eebad" width="400"/></p>
<br/>
<p>The functions \(f\) and \(h\) are defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(f(x)=10 \cdot 2^x\)</li>
<li>\(h(x)=20 \cdot 4^x\)</li>
</ul>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>Which of the following could define function \(g\)? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>\(g(x)=20 \cdot (1.5)^x\)</li>
<li>\(g(x)=20 \cdot (2.5)^x\)</li>
<li>\(g(x)=10 \cdot (3.5)^x\)</li>
<li>\(g(x)=20 \cdot (4.5)^x\)</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>\(g(x)=20 \cdot (2.5)^x\)
</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li>Explain your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p> <strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Equation B. The graph of \(g\) has the same \(y\)-intercept as the graph of \(h\), which is 20. It grows more quickly than \(f\) but more slowly than \(h\), so the growth factor must be greater than 2 but less than 4.</p>
