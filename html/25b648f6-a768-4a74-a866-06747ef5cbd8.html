<p>In this lesson, you will apply what you learned about transforming expressions into factored form to make sense of quadratic equations and persevere in solving them. You will solve equations that were previously only possible to solve using graphing by taking the following steps:</p>
<p>Step 1: Rearrange equations so that one side of the equal sign is 0.<br>
  Step 2: Rewrite the expression in factored form.<br>
  Step 3: Use the zero product property.<br>
  Step 4: Solve each equation.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Rearrange a quadratic equation to be written as <em>expression in factored form&nbsp;</em>\(=0\) and find the solutions. </li>
  <li> Recognize quadratic equations that have zero, one, or two solutions when they are written in factored form. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
