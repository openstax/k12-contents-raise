<p>Spaced retrieval practice is the process of distributing many, short sessions of learning over a longer period of time, as opposed to "cramming" fewer, longer sessions of learning over a shorter period of time \(^{1}\). Spaced practice can promote long-lasting memory of targeted information \(^{2,3}\). To encourage spaced practice, study habits should implement temporal gaps in learning sessions \(^{4,5}\).</p>

<p><strong> Spacing study out into multiple, shorter sessions promotes greater long-term learning than “cramming” study into fewer, longer study sessions.</strong></p>

<p>Engaging in spaced practice can be particularly beneficial for cumulative exams, such as the End-of-Course STAAR exam or similar summative assessments. Students often approach cumulative exams by engaging in long, cramming sessions the night before the exam. With spaced practice, students are encouraged to engage with new and old information over multiple, regular, and shorter sessions. By regularly retrieving this information over a longer period of time, the knowledge becomes easier to retrieve in the future and lasts longer \(^{6}\).</p>

<h5>Spaced Retrieval Practice in the OpenStax Algebra 1 Curriculum</h5>

<p>Each unit has a short, 5-question STAAR quiz associated with it, and there are also two longer, 15-question STAAR exams covering all the TEKS from each semester. Have students revisit concepts from earlier units periodically using these quizzes and exams throughout the school year (not just in the final lead-up to the end of year STAAR exam).</p>
