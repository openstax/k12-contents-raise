<h3>Activity (25 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity enables students to integrate several ideas and skills from the past few lessons. Students write inequalities in two variables to represent constraints in situations, use technology to graph the solutions, interpret points in the solution regions, and use the inequalities and the graphs to answer contextual questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The questions in this activity are written in pairs. The same constraints and contexts will be used in an upcoming lesson on systems of linear inequalities in two variables.</p>
<p>Decide on the structure for the activity depending on the time available and the amount of practice each student needs. Here are some possibilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Assigning all three pairs of questions to all students.</li>
  <li>Assigning each student a pair of questions, arranging students who work on different pairs in groups of 3, and asking them to explain their solutions to one another.</li>
  <li>Arranging students in groups of 3, assigning the same pair of questions to each group, and-for each pair of questions-asking one group to present the solutions to the class.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Continue to provide access to graphing technology. Explain that students will now write and graph inequalities to solve problems about some situations.</p>
<p>Assign at least one pair of questions about the same context to each student. See Activity Narrative for some possible ways to structure the activity.</p>
<p>Some students might not be familiar with terms such as "savings," "checking," or "premium." Explain any unfamiliar terms as needed.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here are three types of situations. Answer the questions about each situation.</p>
<h5><strong>Bank Accounts</strong></h5>
<p>For questions 1–4, use the following scenario: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A customer opens a checking account and a savings account at a bank. They will deposit a maximum of $600, some in the checking account and some in the savings account. (They might not deposit all of it and keep some of the money as cash.)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Write an inequality to describe the constraints. Specify what each variable represents.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x+y \leq 600\), where \(x\) represents the amount deposited in the checking account and \(y\) the amount deposited in the savings account.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li> Use the graphing tool or technology outside the course. Graph the inequality that represents this scenario using the Desmos tool below. (Students were provided access to Desmos.) </li>
</ol>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Name one solution to the inequality and explain what it represents in that situation. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\((500, 100)\). $500 is deposited in checking and $100 in savings. The total is $600, which is the maximum amount the customer plans to deposit.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>If the customer deposits $200 in their checking account, what can you say about the amount they deposit in their savings account?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The customer deposits $400 or less in savings.</p>
<p>For questions 5–8, use the following scenario:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A customer opens a checking account and a savings account at a bank. The bank requires a minimum balance of $50 in the savings account. It does not matter how much money is kept in the checking account.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>Write an inequality to describe the constraints. Specify what each variable represents. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(y \geq 50\), where \(y\) is the balance in the savings account.</p>

  <li>Name one solution to the inequality and explain what it represents in that situation.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\((50, 50)\). The customer keeps $50 in savings and $50 in checking, which meets the minimum of $50 deposited in savings.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="8">
  <li> If the customer deposits no money in the checking account but is able to maintain both accounts without penalty, what can you say about the amount deposited in the savings account? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The customer deposits at least $50 in the savings account.</p>
<br>
<h5><strong>Concert Tickets</strong></h5>

<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>

<p>This activity will require a partner and either graph paper or Desmos.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Without letting your partner see it, write an equation of a line so that both the \(x\)-intercept and the \(y\)-intercept are each between -3 and 3. Graph your equation.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.</p>
<p>\(y = (\frac23)x + 1\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Still without letting your partner see it, rewrite your equation as an inequality. That is, write an inequality for which your equation is the related equation. In other words, your line should be the boundary between the solution region and non-solution region. Shade the solutions on your graph.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. </p>
<p>\(y &ge; (\frac23)x + 1\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Take turns stating coordinates of points. Your partner will tell you whether your guess is a solution to their inequality. After each partner has stated a point, each may guess what the other's inequality is. If neither guesses correctly, play continues. Use another coordinate system to keep track of your guesses.</li>
</ol>
<p>What was your process for determining your partner&rsquo;s inequality?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.</p>
<p>I know the \(y\)-intercept is between -3 and 3, so I can guess a coordinate value of \(y\) between -3 and 3 and \(x = 0\). </p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>One inequality in the bank account context involves only one variable. Some students might think that all inequalities they write must include two variables. Reassure them that this might not always be the case. Consider pointing to examples from earlier activities in which they wrote or graphed inequalities such as&nbsp;\( y&gt;2 \)&nbsp;or&nbsp;\( b&lt;10 \).</p>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>Select one student or one group to present their solutions for each pair of questions. Focus the discussion on how students used the inequalities and graphs to help answer the question about each situation.</p>
<p>Students who worked on the same questions might end up with different graphs and answers because they wrote different inequalities (which might not correctly represent the constraints in the situation). If this happens, analyze the different inequalities and look for the potential causes for the discrepancy. One possibility is that the wrong symbols or the wrong numbers were entered into the graphing tool.</p>
<p>Another possibility might be that students made different decisions about the quantities being assigned to the vertical and horizontal axes. In that case, both versions of the graphs might be correct, but the answers to questions might be different if one of the graphs is not interpreted correctly.</p>

<h4>Graphing Linear Inequalities in Two Variables to Solve Applications</h4>
<p>Many fields use linear inequalities to model a problem. While our examples may be about simple situations, they give us an opportunity to build our skills and to get a feel for how they might be used.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>For questions 1–3, use the following scenario to write, graph, and find solutions to an inequality:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hilaria works two part-time jobs in order to earn enough money to meet her obligations of at least $240 a week. Her job in food service pays $10 an hour and her tutoring job on campus pays $15 an hour. How many hours does Hilaria need to work at each job to earn at least $240?&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Let \(x\) be the number of hours she works at the job in food service and let \(y\) be the number of hours she works tutoring. Write an inequality that would model this situation.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>We let \( x \) be the number of hours she works at the job in food service and let \( y \) be the number of hours she works tutoring. She earns $10 per hour at the job in food service and $15 an hour tutoring. At each job, the number of hours multiplied by the hourly wage will gives the amount earned at that job.</p>
<p><img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/cc2b9c88a9651d5c9632e2b4cc49b6aab6b22cfc"/></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Graph the inequality. </li>
</ol>
<p>To graph the inequity, we put it in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p>\( \begin{eqnarray} 10x + 15y \geq 240 \\ 15y \geq -10x + 240 \\y \geq - \frac{2}{3}x + 16 \end{eqnarray} \)<br>
</p>
<p><img alt class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="305" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/3ca16ac51454808b8645fea25bfaa8c13d218723" width="300"><br>
</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Find three ordered pairs \((x, y)\) that would be solutions to the inequality. Then, explain what that means for Hilaria.</li>
</ol>
<p>From the graph, we see that the ordered pairs \( (15,10) \), \( (0,16) \), \( (24,0) \) represent three of infinitely many solutions. Check the values in the inequality.</p>
<img alt class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="161" role="presentation" src=" https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/657ed958ce40344d1bbc05587cc508eb290a2c7a" width="675"><br>
<br>
<p>For Hilaria, it means that to earn at least $240, she can work 15 hours tutoring and 10 hours at her fast-food job, earn all her money tutoring for 16 hours, or earn all her money while working 24 hours at the job in food service.</p>
<br>
<h4>Try It: Graphing Linear Inequalities in Two Variables to Solve Applications</h4>
<p>For questions 1–3, use the following scenario to write, graph, and find solutions to an inequality:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Elijah works two part-time jobs. One is at a grocery store that pays $10 an hour and the other is babysitting for $13 per hour. Between the two jobs, Elijah wants to earn at least $260 a week. How many hours does Elijah need to work at each job to earn at least $260?&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Let \(x\) be the number of hours he works at the grocery store and let \(y\) be the number of hours he works babysitting. Write an inequality that would model this situation. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(10x+13y \geq 260\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Graph the inequality. (Students were provided access to Desmos.) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/50559651dc86edfbe4480e8f4358916046348fea"/></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Find three ordered pairs \((x, y)\) that would be solutions to the inequality. Then, explain what that means for Elijah. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.</p>
<p>\((20, 10)\), \((15, 20)\), \((10, 25)\). For each of these coordinate points, if Elijah worked \(x\) hours at the grocery store and \(y\) hours babysitting, he would earn at least $260.</p>
