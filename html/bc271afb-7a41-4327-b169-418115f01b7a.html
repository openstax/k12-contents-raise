<div>
<p>This activity enables students to integrate several ideas and skills from the past few lessons. Students write inequalities in two variables to represent constraints in situations, use technology to graph the solutions, interpret points in the solution regions, and use the inequalities and the graphs to answer contextual questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The questions in this activity are written in pairs. The same constraints and contexts will be used in an upcoming lesson on systems of linear inequalities in two variables.</p>
<p>Decide on the structure for the activity depending on the time available and the amount of practice each student needs. Here are some possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assigning all three pairs of questions to all students.</li>
<li>Assigning each student a pair of questions, arranging students who work on different pairs in groups of 3, and asking them to explain their solutions to one another.</li>
<li>Arranging students in groups of 3, assigning the same pair of questions to each group, and-for each pair of questions-asking one group to present the solutions to the class.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<div>
<p>Continue to provide access to graphing technology. Explain that students will now write and graph inequalities to solve problems about some situations.</p>
<p>Assign at least one pair of questions about the same context to each student. See Activity Narrative for some possible ways to structure the activity.</p>
<p>Some students might not be familiar with terms such as "savings," "checking," or "premium." Explain any unfamiliar terms as needed.</p>
<h4>Support for Students with Disabilities</h4>
<div>
<p><em></em><i>E</i><em>ngagement: Provide Access by Recruiting Interest.</em>&nbsp;Leverage choice around perceived challenge. Chunking this task into more manageable parts may also support students who benefit from additional processing time. Invite students to select one of the situations to work on. If students are arranged in groups, each member should be prepared to share during the whole-class discussion.<br><em>Supports accessibility for: Attention; Social-emotional skills</em><em></em></p>

<h3>Student Facing Statement</h3>
<div>
<p>Here are three types of situations. Answer the questions about each situation.</p>
<p><strong>Bank Accounts</strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>1. A customer opens a checking account and a savings account at a bank. They will deposit a maximum of $600, some in the checking account and some in the savings account. (They might not deposit all of it and keep some of the money as cash.)</p>

<h3>Student Facing Extension</h3>
<h4>Are you ready for more?</h4>
<div>
<p>This activity will require a partner.</p>
<p><span>1. Without letting your partner see it, write an equation of a line so that both the&nbsp;\( x \)-intercept and the&nbsp;\( y \)-intercept are each between -3 and 3. Graph your equation on one of the coordinate systems.</span></p>
<div>

</div>
<div><span><br></span></div>
<div><span>2. Still without letting your partner see it, write an inequality for which your equation is the related equation. In other words, your line should be the boundary between solutions and non-solutions. Shade the solutions on your graph.</span></div>
<div><span><br></span></div>
<div><span>3. Take turns stating coordinates of points. Your partner will tell you whether your guess is a solution to their inequality. After each partner has stated a point, each may guess what the other's inequality is. If neither guesses correctly, play continues. Use the other coordinate system to keep track of your guesses.<br><br></span></div>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Extension Student Response</h3>
<div>
<p>Answers vary.</p>
</div>
<h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>
<div>
<p>One inequality in the bank account context involves only one variable. Some students might think that all inequalities they write must include two variables. Reassure them that this might not always be the case. Consider pointing to examples from earlier activities in which they wrote or graphed inequalities such as&nbsp;\( y&gt;2 \)&nbsp;or&nbsp;\( b&lt;10 \).</p>
</div>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<div>
<p>Select one student or one group to present their solutions for each pair of questions. Focus the discussion on how students used the inequalities and graphs to help answer the question about each situation.</p>
<p>Students who worked on the same questions might end up with different graphs and answers because they wrote different inequalities (which might not correctly represent the constraints in the situation). If this happens, analyze the different inequalities and look for the potential causes for the discrepancy. One possibility is that the wrong symbols or the wrong numbers were entered into the graphing tool.</p>
<p>Another possibility might be that students made different decisions about the quantities being assigned to the vertical and horizontal axes. In that case, both versions of the graphs might be correct, but the answers to questions might be different if one of the graphs is not interpreted correctly.</p>

<h4>Graphing Linear Inequalities in Two Variables to Solve Applications</h4>

<p><strong>Example </strong><br>Hilaria works two part time jobs in order to earn enough money to meet her obligations of at least $240 a week. Her job in food service pays $10 an hour and her tutoring job on campus pays $15 an hour. How many hours does Hilaria need to work at each job to earn at least $240?&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>a. Let&nbsp; \( x \)&nbsp; be the number of hours she works at the job in food service and let&nbsp;\( y \) be the number of hours she works tutoring. Write an inequality that would model this situation.</p>
<p>b. Graph the inequality.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>c. Find three ordered pairs&nbsp;\( (x, y) \) &nbsp;that would be solutions to the inequality. Then, explain what that means for Hilaria.</span><br></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>a. We let&nbsp;\( x \) be the number of hours she works at the job in food service and let&nbsp;\( y \) be the number of hours she works tutoring. She earns $10 per hour at the job in food service and $15 an hour tutoring. At each job, the number of hours multiplied by the hourly wage will gives the amount earned at that job.</p>

<p>b. To graph the inequity, we put it in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p>\( \begin{eqnarray} 10x + 15y \geq 240 \\ 15y \geq -10x + 240 \\y \geq - \frac{2}{3}x + 16 \end{eqnarray} \)<br></p>

<p>c.&nbsp;From the graph, we see that the ordered pairs \( (15,10) \), \( (0,16) \),&nbsp;\( (24,0) \) represent three of infinitely many solutions. Check the values in the inequality.</p>

<p>For Hilaria, it means that to earn at least $240, she can work 15 hours tutoring and 10 hours at her fast-food job, earn all her money tutoring for 16 hours, or earn all her money while working 24 hours at the job in food service.</p>
<h4>Try It: Graphing Linear Inequalities in Two Variables&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Hugh works two part time jobs. One at a grocery store that pays $10 an hour and the other is babysitting for $13 per hour. Between the two jobs, Hugh wants to earn at least $260 a week. How many hours does Hugh need to work at each job to earn at least $260?&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Let&nbsp;\( x \) be the number of hours he works at the grocery store and let&nbsp;\( y \) be the number of hours he works babysitting. Write an inequality that would model this situation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>b. Graph the inequality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>c. Find three ordered pairs&nbsp;\( (x, y) \) that would be solutions to the inequality. Then, explain what that means for Hugh.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>a. \( 10x+13y&ge;260 \)</p>
<p>b.</p>

<p>c. Answers will vary. Sample answers: \( (20, 10) \), \( (15, 20) \), \( (10, 25) \); For each of these coordinate points, if Hugh worked&nbsp;\( x \) hours at the grocery store and&nbsp;\( y \) hours babysitting, he would earn at least $260.</p>
<p>How did you do? Know that you learn more from wrong answers than from right answers! Wrong answers help us find flaws in our thinking. Take a minute to think about <em>why</em> you got the question wrong. Then you won&rsquo;t get this type of question wrong again!</p>
