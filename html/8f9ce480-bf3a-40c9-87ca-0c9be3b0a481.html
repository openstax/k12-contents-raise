<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm-up asks students not only to identify that a quantity is changing linearly or exponentially, but also to
  identify a term when the preceding value is not given.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. For the last question, ask each partner to come up with a new equation.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Use the patterns you notice to complete the tables. Show your reasoning. Complete your work on paper. Then select the
  <strong>Solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Table B: 640 when \(x\) is 4, and \(2.5 \cdot 4^{25}\) when \(x\)&nbsp;is 25.</p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>For the last entry in each table, students may struggle to find the actual value to write in the table. Explain that
  an expression representing the value is all that&rsquo;s needed.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Focus the discussion on how students used the patterns in the tables to generate a \(y\)-value for a non-consecutive
  value of \(x\). Make sure students are able to express the pattern of repeated addition in the first table, using an
  expression like \(2.5+7.5^x\), and that they can express the pattern of repeated multiplication in the second table
  using an exponential expression like \((2.5) \cdot 4^x\). Highlight the words <em>linear</em> and <em>exponential</em>
  to describe how the quantities are changing suggested by the tables.</p>
