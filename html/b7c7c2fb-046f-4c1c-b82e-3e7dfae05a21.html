<h4> Lesson Narrative&nbsp;</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students analyze the graph of an exponential function \(f\) given by \(f(x)=a \cdot b^x\). In particular, they study the effect of \(b\)&nbsp;on the shape of the graph. To observe how \(b\)&nbsp;impacts the shape of the graph when \(b&gt;1\) and when \( 0&lt;b&lt;1\), they simultaneously examine several functions of this form, all of which have the same value of \(a\).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrow contexts are used in these lessons to encourage greater attention to the growth factors of the different functions, rather than on interpreting the quantities in context. Since students are focusing mainly on understanding how varying \(b\)&nbsp;impacts the graph, they are looking at the structure of an exponential function and its graph. Connecting exponential functions to real-world situations helps students understand why it is important to learn about this type of function.</p>
<p>One of the activities in this lesson works best when each student has access to devices that can run a Desmos applet because students will benefit from seeing the relationship in a dynamic way.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Describe (orally and in writing) the effect of changing \(a\) and \(b\) on a graph that represents \(f(x)=a \cdot b^x\). </li>
  <li> Use equations and graphs to compare exponential functions. </li>
</ul>
