<h4> Lesson Narrative&nbsp;</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students analyze the graph of an exponential function \(f\) given by \(f(x)=a \cdot b^x\). In
  particular, they study the effect of \(b\)&nbsp;on the shape of the graph. To observe how \(b\)&nbsp;impacts the shape
  of the graph when \(b&gt;1\) and when \( 0&lt;b&lt;1\), they simultaneously examine several functions of this form,
  all of which have the same value of \(a\).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrow contexts are used in these lessons to encourage greater attention to the growth factors of the different
  functions, rather than on interpreting the quantities in context. Since students are focusing mainly on understanding
  how varying \(b\)&nbsp;impacts the graph, they are looking at the structure of an exponential function and its graph.
  Connecting exponential functions to real-world situations helps students understand why it is important to learn about
  this type of function.</p>
<p>One of the activities in this lesson works best when each student has access to devices that can run a Desmos applet
  because students will benefit from seeing the relationship in a dynamic way.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Describe (orally and in writing) the effect of changing \(a\) and \(b\) on a graph that represents \(f(x)=a \cdot
    b^x\). </li>
  <li> Use equations and graphs to compare exponential functions. </li>
</ul>
<h4> Learning Targets (Student Facing)&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Describe the effect of changing \(a\) and \(b\) on a graph that represents \(f(x)=a \cdot b^x\). </li>
  <li> Use equations and graphs to compare exponential functions. </li>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are
  only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.
  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A1(E) internalize new basic and academic language by using and reusing it in meaningful ways in speaking and
    writing activities that build concept and language attainment</li>
  <li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and
    reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
  <li>A3(F) ask and give information ranging from using a very limited bank of high-frequency, high-need, concrete
    vocabulary, including key words and expressions needed for basic communication in academic and social contexts, to
    using abstract and content-based vocabulary during extended speaking assignments</li>
  <li>A3(G) express opinions, ideas, and feelings ranging from communicating single words and short phrases to
    participating in extended discussions on a variety of social and grade-appropriate academic topics</li>
</ul>
