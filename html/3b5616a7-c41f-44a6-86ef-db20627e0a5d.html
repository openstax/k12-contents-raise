<h2>Activity (10 minutes)</h2>
<div class="body">
<p>Writing and solving equations often revolves around the idea of representing and satisfying constraints. This activity introduces the term &ldquo;constraints&rdquo; and begins to develop the idea that expressions and equations can help us describe constraints on quantities. It prompts students to recognize that quantities are sometimes constrained in terms of the values they could take or in terms of how they relate to another quantity.</p>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<p>Tell students that they will now look at some constraints of the pizza party. Explain that a constraint is something that limits what is possible or what is reasonable in a situation. For example, one constraint a teacher has to work with is the amount of time in a class period or the number of school days in a year (both of these might be fixed numbers). Another constraint might be the number of students in a class (which may vary by class but is usually no more than a certain number).</p>
<p>Consider keeping students in groups of 4. Give students 2 minutes of quiet work time and then time to briefly share their responses with their group. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>

<p>Representation: Develop Language and Symbols. Display or provide charts with symbols and meanings. Invite students to name additional examples of variables that might be considered constraints to encourage critical thinking and application to the expressions created in this activity. Examples of additional constraints might include&nbsp;\( t &lt; 2 \) to represent how long the party could last, or&nbsp;\( b &lt; 3 \) to say that each student will get fewer than 3 beverages.<br><br>Supports accessibility for: Conceptual processing; Memory</p>

<h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>
<p>A <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">constraint</span> is something that limits what is possible or reasonable in a situation.</p>
<p>For example, one constraint in a pizza party might be the number of slices of pizza each person could have, \(s\). We can write \( s&lt;4 \) to say that each person gets fewer than 4 slices.</p>

<ol>
<li>Look at the expressions you wrote when planning the pizza party earlier.<ol>
<li>Choose an expression that uses one or more letters.</li>
<li>For each letter, determine what values would be reasonable. (For instance, could the value be a non-whole number? A number greater than 50? A negative number? Exactly 2?)<br><br></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Write equations or inequalities that represent some constraints in your pizza party plan. If a quantity must be an exact value, use the = symbol. If it must be greater than or less than a certain value to be reasonable, use the \( &gt; \) or \( &lt; \) symbol.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Student Response</h3>
<p>1. Sample response:</p>
<p>\( 4c + 3p \), where c represents the price of a large cheese pizza and p the price of a large pepperoni pizza.</p>
<p>\( c \)&nbsp;and&nbsp;\( p \) can be whole or non-whole numbers. They represent prices of pizza, so they can&rsquo;t be negative. A large cheese pizza could be as low as $7.50 with a coupon or when there is a special promotion and is usually less than $12. A large one-topping pizza is usually more than $11 but less than $20.</p>
<p>2. Sample response:</p>
<p>\( c = 7.50 \) or \( c &gt; 7.50 \) and \( c &lt; 12 \)<br><span>\( p &gt; 11 \) and \( p &lt; 20 \)</span></p>
<h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>
<p>If students have trouble thinking of constraints for a chosen variable, ask about extreme values. For instance, ask: &ldquo;Do you think a large pizza might cost $100? How about $3?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some students may struggle with translating the written descriptions of the constraints into inequalities. For example, &ldquo;the greatest number of students in the class would be 30&rdquo; might be mistakenly written as \(&nbsp;ùë† &gt; 30 \).&nbsp; Ask these students to explain the meaning of the&nbsp;\( &gt; \) symbol. Ask: &ldquo;If 29 students come to class, can we write \(&nbsp;29 &gt; 30&nbsp;\)?&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>Invite students to share the equations or inequalities that represent the constraints in their party plan. Emphasize the following points:</p>
<p>Sometimes, a constraint is an exact value. For example: Ordering pizza online involves a fee of $2.50, or the price of a large cheese pizza is $9.</p>
<p>Other times, a constraint involves a boundary or a limit. For example: An order must be at least $25 to qualify for free delivery, or the party must cost no more than $90.</p>
<h3>1.1.3: Self Check&nbsp;</h3>
