<h2>Activity (10 minutes)</h2>
<p>Writing and solving equations often revolves around the idea of representing and satisfying constraints. This activity introduces the term &ldquo;constraints&rdquo; and begins to develop the idea that expressions and equations can help us describe constraints on quantities. It prompts students to recognize that quantities are sometimes constrained in terms of the values they could take or in terms of how they relate to another quantity.</p>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<p>Tell students that they will now look at some constraints of the pizza party. Explain that a constraint is something that limits what is possible or what is reasonable in a situation. For example, one constraint a teacher has to work with is the amount of time in a class period or the number of school days in a year (both of these might be fixed numbers). Another constraint might be the number of students in a class (which may vary by class but is usually no more than a certain number).</p>
<p>Consider keeping students in groups of 4. Give students 2 minutes of quiet work time and then time to briefly share their responses with their group. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>A constraint is something that limits what is possible or reasonable in a situation.</p>
<p>For example, one constraint in a pizza party might be the number of slices of pizza each person could have, \(s\). We can write \( s&lt;4 \) to say that each person gets fewer than 4 slices.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> What is the expression you are examining?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is an example. <br>
  \( (1.50t + 21.99)p + d \)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>What does the first letter represent?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is an example. <br>
  \(t = \) number of toppings</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>What values would be reasonable for this first letter? (For instance, could the value be greater than 50? Is it possible for the letter to be a non-whole number? A negative number?)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is an example. <br>
  The cost of a topping is usually less than $2.00 per topping</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>What does the second letter represent? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is an example. <br>
  \(p =\) number of pizzas ordered</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>What values would be reasonable for this second letter? (For instance, could the value be greater than 50? Is it possible for the letter to be a non-whole number? A negative number?) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is an example. <br>
  The number of pizzas ordered will probably be less than or equal to the number of students in the class. </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
  <li>Write equations or inequalities that represent some constraints in your pizza party plan. If a quantity must be an exact value, use the \(=\) symbol. If it must be greater than or less than a certain value to be reasonable, use the \( &gt; \) or \( &lt; \) symbol. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is an example. </p>
<ul>
  <li>\(t \leq 2.00 \)</li>
  <li>\(p \leq 30\) </li>
  <li> \(d \leq 5.00\) if \(d\) represents the delivery charge </li>
</ul>

<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>Invite students to share the equations or inequalities that represent the constraints in their party plan. Emphasize the following points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sometimes, a constraint is an exact value. For example: Ordering pizza online involves a fee of $2.50, or the price of a large cheese pizza is $9.</li>
  <li>Other times, a constraint involves a boundary or a limit. For example: An order must be at least $25 to qualify for free delivery, or the party must cost no more than $90.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.1.3: Self Check</h3>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold"><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">QUESTION:</p>
<p>Marcus works\( s \) hours per week stocking shelves. He works \(m\) hours per week mowing lawns. Marcus works at least 8 hours per week stocking shelves. He works at most a total of 20 hours per week. Which of the following represent constraints for this situation?</p>

<h3>1.1.3: Additional Resources</h3>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold"><em>The following content is available to students who would like more support based on their experience with the self check. Students will not automatically have access to this content, so you may wish to share it with those who could benefit from it.</em></p>

<h4>Inequalities</h4>
<br>
<p>One way to represent a <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">constraint</span> is to use an inequality symbol. For example, you may decide that at most 3 toppings should be on each pizza. This could be represented by \(t &lt; 3\), if \(t\) represents the number of toppings. <br>
  On the number line, the numbers get larger as they go from left to right. The number line can be used to explain the symbols &ldquo;\( &lt; \)&rdquo; and &ldquo;\( &gt; \).&rdquo;</p>
<p>\( a &lt; b \) is read &ldquo;\( a \) is less than \( b \).&rdquo;  \( a \) is to the left of \( b \) on the number line. <img alt="No Alt Text" data-media-type="image/jpeg" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/8564b2c4dcdb8fb0cd11c3f6d9d9c093ea4bde22"></p>
<p> \( a &gt; b \) is read &ldquo;\( a \) is greater than \( b \).&rdquo;  \( a \) is to the right of \( b \) on the number line.<img alt="No Alt Text" data-media-type="image/jpeg" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/91008c89e93d49d5c5739cc75af6a6d9a14bbf87"></p>
<p> The expressions \( a &lt; b \) or \( a &gt; b \) can be read from left to right or right to left, though in English we usually read from left to right. </p>
<ul>
  <li>For example, \(7 &lt; 11\) is equivalent to \(11 &gt; 7\).</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, \(7 &lt; 11\) is equivalent to \(11 &gt; 7\). </p>
<ul>
  <li>For example, \(17 &gt; 4\) is equivalent to \(4 &lt; 17\).<br>
