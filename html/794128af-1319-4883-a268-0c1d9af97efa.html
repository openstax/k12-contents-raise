<p>Here are graphs showing how the amount of money in each of the purses change. Remember, Purse A starts with $1,000 and grows by $200 each day. Purse B starts with $0.01 and doubles each day.</p>

<p>While on a beach, your friend discovers a different genie. This genie also offers two purses to choose from, and he gives you the following graph to show how the money in each purse will grow. The set of triangular marks that lie on a line represent values in Purse A, and the set of square marks that make a curve represent those in Purse B.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Okay, okay,&rdquo; the genie smiles, disappointed. &ldquo;I will give you an even more enticing deal.&rdquo; He explains that Purse B stays the same, but Purse A now increases by $250,000 every day. Which purse should you choose?</p>

    <p>Your answers may vary, but here is an example:</p>
    <p>Purse B surpasses Purse A on day 30, with about $10.7 million in Purse B and only about $7.5 million in Purse A. So it&rsquo;s better to choose Purse A if the amounts grow for less than 30 days, and it&rsquo;s better to choose Purse B if they grow for 30 days or more.</p>
