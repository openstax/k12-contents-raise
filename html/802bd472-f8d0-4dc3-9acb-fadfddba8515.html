<p>Throughout this unit, you learned that Nafy, owner of Teranga&rsquo;s snack mixes, can use constraints to create recipes for snack mixes that are nutritious and will make a profit for the company. She can use a system of equations to examine the company&rsquo;s profits. Constraints can be used to represent the upper and lower limits of weight, cost, and nutritional values of the snack mixes. Inequalities can be used to represent those constraints. Inequalities in two variables can be used to find combinations of two ingredients that meet constraints. Systems of inequalities can be used to find combinations of ingredients that create snacks that meet the company&rsquo;s goals of nutrition and cost.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Similarly, in this unit, you learned how to write and solve systems of linear equations. You learned that the solution to a system of equations is a pair of coordinates that satisfies both equations. You used graphing and algebraic methods to find solutions.</p>
<p>You also learned to use constraints to represent upper and lower limits in real-world situations. You used inequalities in one variable to represent these constraints. You learned that the solution set to one-variable inequalities is a range of values that can be graphed on a number line.</p>
<p>Next, you wrote inequalities in two variables to represent constraints. You learned that the solution set is combinations of values that make the inequality true. The graph of the solution set is a region bounded by a line that may or not be part of the solution.</p>
<p>Finally, you learned that two linear inequalities that represent the constraints in the same situation form a system of inequalities. You learned that the solutions to the system include all pairs of numbers that satisfy both constraints simultaneously. You represented the solution set of the system graphically by identifying pairs of points in the region where the graphs of the individual inequalities overlap. <br>

<h3>Building Character: Growth Mindset </h3>
<p>In this unit, you learned that a growth mindset helps you focus on developing your abilities rather than proving how smart you are. The brain is like a muscle that you can strengthen. Improvement comes from challenging yourself and exercising your brain. When you make a mistake, use that as an opportunity to learn the error in your thinking. You may look for a similar example or find someone who can help you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
