<p>In this lesson, you will begin to solve quadratic equations by reasoning about what values would make the equations true and by using structure in the equations. You will explore in depth the idea that some quadratic equations have two solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Find solutions to quadratic equations by reasoning about the values that make the equation true. </li>
  <li> Explain that quadratic equations may have one or two solutions. </li>
  <li> Implement the square root property. </li>
