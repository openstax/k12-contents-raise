<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>Building on the informal language students have used so far in the unit, the purpose of this lesson is for students to understand that sequences are functions and to use function notation when defining them with equations. In previous lessons, they described the arithmetic sequence 99, 96, 93, . . . as starting at 99 where each term is 3 less than the previous term. Now they think of it as a function \(f\) of the position, starting at position 1, and write \(f(1)=99\) and \(f(n)=f(n-1)-3\) for \(n\geq2\), where \(n\) is an integer. This is called a recursive definition for \(f\) because it describes a repeated, or recurring, process for getting the values of the sequence&mdash;namely, the process of subtracting 3 each time. Students will use recursive definitions to describe functions in both mathematical and real-world contexts throughout the remainder of this unit. It is not necessary that they use the term &ldquo;recursive definition,&rdquo; however.</p>
<p>Throughout this unit, definitions of sequences written in function notation are always followed by an inequality that describes the domain of the function, which is particularly helpful when students work with definitions for the term of a sequence and need to indicate what the first term of the sequence is. This is not meant to imply that all students should use such inequalities every time they define a sequence using function notation. In your classroom, it may be better to ask students to write out in words, instead of inequalities, the restrictions on the domain of a sequence.</p>
<p>Keep the focus on writing equations and tell students to be prepared to respond orally when asked about the domain of a sequence.</p>
<p>The goal of the lesson is for students to practice interpreting and writing recursive definitions of functions while also representing functions in different ways. Students match sequences and recursive definitions in a matching activity, giving them opportunities to explain their reasoning and critique the reasoning of others. An important part of the activities is giving students time to share and explain their strategies for matching and creating different representations. This helps emphasize that there is often more than one way to approach problems. It also helps establish that sharing strategies and learning from other students are classroom norms.</p>
