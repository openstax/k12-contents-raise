<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm up refreshes the work in lesson 7.10. It prepares students to deepen their understanding of the factored form and the intercepts of a graph that represents a quadratic function.</p>
<p>As students work, notice how they find the \(y\)-coordinate of the \(y\)-intercept. Identify students who do so by evaluating w(0). Ask them to share during a whole-class discussion. If a student is struggling to start, remind them they know how to find the intercept of a factored quadratic from 7.10.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Give students quiet work time and then time to share their work with a partner. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here is a graph of a function \(w\) defined by \(w(x)=(x+1.6)(x-2)\). Three points on the graph are labeled.</p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may think that the numerical values in the equation correspond directly to the \(x\)-intercepts in the graph and incorrectly state that \(a=-2\) and \(c=1.6\). Remind them that a graph shows all pairs of \(x\)- and \(y\)-values that make the equation true. Consider asking these students to try substituting -2 for \(x\) and evaluating the expression to verify that \(w(-2)=0\).</p>
<p>Students will have opportunities to attend to the signs or the operations in quadratic expressions in factored form, so it is not essential that this misconception is corrected at this moment.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their responses and reasoning. If not mentioned in students' explanations, emphasize that:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li> \(b\) and \(d\) must be 0 because the \(y\)-coordinate of the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph of any function is 0. </li>
  <li> \(e\) must be 0 because the \(x\)-coordinate of the \(y\)-intercept of the graph of any function is 0. </li>
  <li> \(a\) and \(c\) correspond to the "1.6" and "2" in the factored expression. Students may reason that the graph shows that the positive \(x\)-intercept is farther away from 0 than the negative \(x\)-intercept, suggesting that \(c\) is 2 and \(a\) is -1.6. They may also use their observations from an earlier lesson: that when a factor in the expression shows a negative sign or subtraction, a corresponding intercept takes a positive value, and when a factor shows a positive sign or addition, a corresponding intercept takes a negative value. Either explanation is reasonable at this point. </li>
  <li> \((0,f)\) is the \(y\)-intercept, so the value of \(f\) would be found by evaluating \(w(0)\), which is -3.2, because \((0+1.6)(0-2)=(1.6)(-2)=-3.2\). </li>
</ul>
