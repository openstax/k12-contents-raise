<p>In this lesson, you will investigate the relationship between the parameters \(a\) and \(b\)&nbsp;in the expression \(a \cdot b^x\) and a graph representing the function \(f\)&nbsp;given by \(f(x)=a \cdot b^x\). You will start by identifying a function represented by a given graph and using the graph to make sense of a situation. You will also examine two abstract graphs, with unlabeled axes, and decide which one represents a given situation. In both cases, you will use your understanding of the connections between the parameters in an exponential expression and the features of an exponential graph to answer questions.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li> Explain the meaning of the intersection of the graphs of two functions in terms of the situations they represent. </li>
  <li> Write an equation for the function given two points on a graph of an exponential function. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the<strong> activities </strong>that will help you reach those goals:</p>
