<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>For this activity, you will use two graphs that represent situations you saw in other activities. </p>
<p>For questions 1–3, use the graph below:<br>
  The graph represents \(a = 450 − 20t\), which describes the relationship between gallons of water in a tank and time
  in minutes.</p>

      450 is the gallons of water in the tank at 0 minutes, before the tank starts to be drained. −20
      means the gallons of water (vertical value) drops by 20 for every 1 minute increase in time (horizontal value).
      is the slope. </p>

      <li> The graph represents \(6x +9y = 75\). It describes the relationship between pounds of almonds and figs and the
        dollar amount Clare spent on them. Suppose a classmate says, “I am not sure the graph represents \(6x +9y = 75\)
        because I don’t see the 6, 9, or 75 on the graph.” How would you show your classmate that the graph indeed
        represents
        this equation? <br>

    <p>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample</p>
    <ul>
      <li> If we substitute 0 for \(x\) in the equation and solve for \(y\), we get \(\frac {75}{9}\) or \(8 \frac 13\) . That combination is the point
        \((0,8 \frac 13)\) or the \(y\)-intercept of the graph. If we substitute 0 for \(y\) in the equation and solve for \(x\), we
        get 12.5 for \(x\). That combination is the point (12.5,0) or the \(x\)-intercept of the graph.</li>
      <li>If we substitute the \(x\)- and \(y\)-values of any point on the graph in the equation, the equation remains true.</li>
      <li>If we rewrite the equation and solve for \(y\), we have \( y = \dfrac {75 - 6x}{9} \) or \( y = 8\frac13 - \frac23x \). The \( 8\frac13 \) matches where the graph
        intersects the \(y\)-axis and \( -\frac23\) matches the slope of the
        graph. (For every 3 additional pounds of almonds that Clare bought, she could buy 2 fewer pounds of figs.)</li>
      <li>From the graph, we can see that the \(y\)-intercept is \( (0,8\frac13) \) and the slope is \( -\frac23 \), so the equation of the line is
        \( y = 8\frac13 - \frac23x \). Multiplying each side of the equation by 9 (an acceptable move) gives an equivalent equation, \( 9y = 75 - 6x\), 
        which can be rewritten as \( 6x + 9y = 75\).</li>
    </ul>
