<h4>Identify Positive and Negative Trends&nbsp;</h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Scatter plots may have a strong linear trend or a weak linear trend. A strong positive trend means as one variable increases, the other variable increases, A strong negative trend means as one variable increases, the other variable decreases. A weak linear pattern means the points are more scattered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br></p>
