<h4>Identify Positive and Negative Trends&nbsp;</h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Scatter plots may have a strong linear trend or a weak linear trend. A strong positive trend means as one variable increases, the other variable increases, A strong negative trend means as one variable increases, the other variable decreases. A weak linear pattern means the points are more scattered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br></p>

    <p>Here is how to describe the relationship:</p>
    <p>As the \(x\)-values increase, the \(y\)-values decrease. The trend is negative. The relationship is linear, but the points are scattered, so the relationship is weak.</p>

      <p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: There does appear to be a positive relationship, but that is because both quantities are increasing. The answer is there appears to be a positive relationship between bite force and body mass. The greater the body mass, the greater the bite force tends to be.</p>

    <div class="os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response" data-answer="There appears to be a negative relationship between bite force and body mass. The greater the body mass, the greater the bite force tends to be.">
      <p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: When there is a negative relationship, one quantity increases while another decreases. The answer is there appears to be a positive relationship between bite force and body mass. The greater the body mass, the greater the bite force tends to be.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response" data-answer="There appears to be a negative relationship between bite force and body mass. The greater the body mass, the lighter the bite force tends to be.">
      <p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: looking at the scatter plot, as the body mass increases, so does the bite force. The answer is there appears to be a positive relationship between bite force and body mass. The greater the body mass, the greater the bite force tends to be. </p>

  <div class="os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response">
    <p>That&rsquo;s correct! Check yourself: As the body mass of the crocodiles increases, so does the bite force. Since both quantities are increasing, there appears to be a positive relationship.</p>
