<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students continue to examine the ties between quadratic expressions in standard form and the graphs that represent them. The focus this time is on the coefficient of the linear term, the \(b\) in \(ax^2+bx+c\), and how changes to it affect the graph. Students are not expected to know how to modify given expressions to transform the graphs in certain ways, but they will notice that adding a linear term to the squared term translates the graph in both horizontal and vertical directions. This understanding will help students to conclude that writing an expression such as \(x^2+bx\) in factored form can help us reason about the graph.</p>
<p>Students also practice writing expressions that produce particular graphs. To do so, students make use of the structure in quadratic expressions and what they learned about the connections between expressions and graphs.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Describe (orally and in writing) how the \(b\) in \(ax^2+bx+c\) affects the graph. </li>
  <li> Write quadratic expressions in standard and factored forms that match given graphs. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Explain how the \(b\) in \(ax^2+bx+c\) affects the graph of the equation. </li>
  <li> Match equations given in standard and factored form with their graph. </li>
</ul>

<h4> Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<div>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS.  The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.<br>&nbsp;<br>
	<ul>
	<li>ELPS 1(E) internalize new basic and academic language by using and reusing it in meaningful ways in speaking and writing activities that build concept and language attainment</li>

<li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment</li>

<li>ELPS 3(B) expand and internalize initial English vocabulary by learning and using high-frequency English words necessary for identifying and describing people, places, and objects, by retelling simple stories and basic information represented or supported by pictures, and by learning and using routine language needed for classroom communication </li>

<li>ELPS 3(D) speak using grade-level content area vocabulary in context to internalize new English words and build academic language proficiency </li>

<li>ELPS 3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions</li>
