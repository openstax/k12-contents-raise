<p>Examine the solution method that has been started below and use it to answer parts d and e.</p>
<p>Original equation<br>
  \(x^2+7x+10=0\)</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Subtract 10 from each side.<br>
  \(x^2+7x=-10\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Multiply each side by 4.<br>
  \(4x^2+4(7x)=-4(10)\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Rewrite \(4x^2\) as \((2x)^2\) and \(4(7x)\) as \(2(7)2x\).<br>
  \((2x)^2+2(7)(2x) +\_\_\_\_^2=\_\_\_\_^2-4(10)\)</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  \(\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\)<br>
  \((2x+\_\_\_\_)^2=\_\_\_\_^2-4(10)\)</p>
<p>Step 5<br>
  \(\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\)<br>
  \(2x+\_\_\_\_= \pm \sqrt{\_\_\_\_^2-4(10)}\)</p>
<p>Step 6<br>
  \(\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\)<br>
  \(2x=\_\_\_\_\pm \sqrt{\_\_\_\_^2-4(10)}\)</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4" type="a">
  <li>In Step 2, what might be a good reason for multiplying each side of the equation by 4?</li>
</ol>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> You must always multiply both sides by 4 when completing the square. </li>
  <li> If the value of \(c\) is positive and you multiply by 4, it will be easier to divide the \(b\) term by 3 before you square it. </li>
  <li> Multiplying by 4 makes the coefficient of the \(b\) term a perfect square, which makes it easier to complete the square. </li>
  <li> Multiplying by 4 makes the coefficient of the squared term a perfect square, which makes it easier to complete the square. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Multiplying by 4 makes the coefficient of the squared term a perfect square, which makes it easier to complete the square.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5" type="a">
  <li>Complete the unfinished steps, then <strong>select two</strong> solutions.</li>
</ol>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> -10 </li>
  <li> -5 </li>
  <li> -2 </li>
  <li> -4 </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The solutions are -5 and -2.</p>
<p>Here are the unfinished steps:</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Rewrite \(4x^2\) as \((2x)^2\) and \(4(7x)\) as \(2(7)2x\).<br>
  \((2x)^2+2(7)(2x) +(7)^2=(7)^2-4(10)\)</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  Factor the trinomial.<br>
  \((2x+7)^2=(7)^2-4(10)\)</p>
<p>Step 5<br>
  Take the square root of each side.<br>
  \(2x+7= \pm \sqrt{7^2-4(10)}\)</p>
<p>Step 6<br>
  Subtract 7 from both sides.<br>
  \(2x=-7 \pm \sqrt{7^2-4(10)}\)</p>
<p>Step 7<br>
  Solve.<br>

  <li>Substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) into the quadratic formula, \(x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2- 4ac}}{2a}\), but do not evaluate any of the expressions. Explain how this expression is related to solving \(x^2+7x+10=0\) by completing the square.</li>
</ol>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> In both forms of solving the equation, you need to list the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to determine the solutions. </li>

  <li> They are related because neither one can have a negative \(c\) value. </li>
  <li> For this equation, the quadratic formula and completing the square are not the same and therefore not related. </li>

  <li>Can you use the quadratic formula to solve this equation?</li>
</ol>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> Yes </li>
  <li> No </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes<br>
  The quadratic formula works for all quadratic equations. Substituting the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) into the quadratic formula and evaluating the expression gives the solutions.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5" type="a">
  <li>Can you solve this equation using square roots?</li>
</ol>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> Yes, the solutions are \(\pm 39\). </li>
  <li> No, there is no solution. </li>
  <li> Yes, the solutions are \(\pm \sqrt{39}\). </li>
  <li> No, this equation can only be solved by the quadratic formula. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, the solutions are \(\pm \sqrt{39}\).<br>
  Adding 39 to both sides of the equation gives \(x^2=39\). The solutions are \(\pm \sqrt{39}\).</p>
