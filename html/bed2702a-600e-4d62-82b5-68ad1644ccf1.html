<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>Students continue to compare quadratic and exponential functions in this activity. This time, they decide how to
  compare the functions.</p>
<p>Monitor for different strategies students may use to compare the functions. Identify students who:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Create one or more tables of values and compare the values of \(p(x)\) and \(q(x)\) at increasingly large values
    of \(x\). </li>
  <li> Graph the functions defined by \(p(x)=6x^2\) and \(q(x)=3^x\) and compare the graphs. </li>
  <li> Create one or more tables of values, calculate the growth factors at equal intervals of input, and then compare
    the growth factors. </li>
</ul>
<p>If students choose graphing or spreadsheet tools strategically to perform comparisons, they are demonstrating an
  understanding of the benefits of different strategies.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Ask students to observe the equations representing the two functions and determine which function is exponential and
  which is quadratic. Invite students to share how they know. Make sure students recognize that \(p\) is quadratic and
  \(q\) is exponential before they begin the activity.</p>
<p>Provide access to graphing technology and spreadsheet tools. This may be a good opportunity for students to
  experiment with the graphing window. If the horizontal dimension is very small (for example, \(0&lt;x&lt;5\)) or the
  vertical dimension is very large (for example,\(0&lt;y&lt;3,000\)), the two graphs will be hard to distinguish. As
  needed, remind students to think about adjusting the graphing window to make the graphs more informative.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here are two functions: \(p(x)=6x^2\) and \(q(x)=3^x\).</p>
<p>Investigate the output of \(p\) and \(q\) for different values of \(x\). For large enough values of \(x\), one
  function will have a greater value than the other.</p>
<p>Which function will have a greater value as \(x\) increases?</p>
<p>Support your answer with tables, graphs, or other representations.</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(q\) is larger when \(x=0\) and again when \(x=5\). Once \(x\) is larger than \(5\), \(q\)
  is growing much more quickly, as shown in the table.</p>

<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Janna says that some exponential functions grow more slowly than the quadratic function as \(x\) increases. Do you
    agree with Janna? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. This is true for the functions \(g(x)=(1 \frac {1}{2})x\) and \(f(x)=x^2\) as \(x\)
  increases for \(x\)-values less than \(10\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Could you have an exponential function \(g(x)=b^x\) so that \(g(x)&lt;f(x)\) for all values of \(x\)?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, \(g(0)&gt;f(0)\) for all values of \(b\) (except \(0\)), because \(b^0=1\) and
  \(0^2=0\). (If \(b=0\), there are problems if \(x\leq 0\), so this is not usually considered an exponential function.)

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students to present their strategies in the sequence listed in the Activity Narrative. If no students chose to
  graph the functions, consider displaying the graphs for all to see. By presenting strategies that involve the
  calculation of growth factors last, students will deepen their understanding of why exponential values will eventually
  overtake the quadratic values.</p>
<p>Again, one way to make sense of why exponential functions eventually grow faster than quadratic functions is by
  thinking of the growth factors. The output of an exponential function always increases by the same factor when the
  input increases by \(1\) (for example, \(3\) for the exponential function \(q\) studied here). The output of a
  quadratic function, in contrast, increases by smaller and smaller amounts when the input increases by \(1\). So even
  though a quadratic function may take larger values than an exponential function for many inputs, the values of the
  exponential function will eventually overtake the quadratic function.</p>

<p>This function is not linear because it does not have a constant rate of change, and it is not exponential because it
  does not have a constant growth factor. The function is quadratic because it can be represented by \(g(x)=3x^2\),
  which has \(x\) to the second power, and that is the greatest power.</p>
<p>Note: Between \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\), \(f(x)\) will have the greater value as \(x\) increases.</p>
<h4>Try It: Exponential versus Quadratic Functions</h4>
<p>Which of the following has the greater value as \(x\) increases, \(f(x)\) or \(g(x)\)?</p>
<p>\(f(x)=3x^2\)</p>
<p>\(g(x)=3^x\)</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>

  increases. This is because \(g(x)\) is exponential and has a constant growth factor.</p>
