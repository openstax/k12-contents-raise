<h3>Meeting Constraints in a Real-World Situation</h3>
<p>Let’s look at a situation similar to the activity and discuss how to find values that meet the constraints given.<br/>
</p>
<p>THEATER SEATS</p>
<img alt='Auditorium seating chart with color-coded rows. Some rows are orange, indicating different seat types, while other rows are navy blue. "Screen" at the top.' class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="364" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/fc04d83a28f7fc52877119f85d078b887eb803aa" width="450"/><br/>
<p>A movie theater sells two types of tickets for a movie showing. Stadium recliner seats cost $18 each, and regular seats cost $15 each. The theater has a total of 40 seats. When every seat is sold, the theater earns $648 in ticket sales. How many stadium recliner seats, \(x\), and how many regular seats, \(y\), are there?</p>
<p>To solve this problem, we first need to recognize that there are two constraints in this situation. The constraints are the total number of seats in the theater and the total money earned from sales. Let’s write an equation to represent each constraint.</p>
<p><strong>Constraint #1: </strong>the total number of seats</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are \(x\) stadium recliner seats and \(y\) regular seats representing a total of 40 seats.</p>
<p>This is represented by the equation \( x + y = 40 \).</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <strong>Constraint #2:</strong> the total sales from the seats</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stadium recliner seats cost $18 and regular seats cost $15, for a total of $648.</p>
<p>This is represented by the equation \(18x + 15y = 648\).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many ways to solve these equations: graphing and algebraic solving, guessing and checking, or using tables.</p>

<div class="os-raise-ib-cta-content">
<p>Let’s try creating a table. We know the total
      number of seats must equal 40. So we can try different values of seat types to
      determine if they match the total sales constraint, $648.</p>
<p>If the total sales value is too low, try more
      stadium recliner seats, since they are more expensive.</p>

<div>
<p>We can see that 16 stadium recliner seats and
      24 regular seats represents a total of 40 seats and is $648 in total sales. </p>
<p>This means the theater has 16 stadium recliner seats and 24 regular seats.</p>
