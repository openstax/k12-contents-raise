<p>In this lesson, you will learn to characterize changes in functions quantitatively, by using average rates of change. You will also learn that the average rate of change can be used to measure how fast a function changes over a given interval.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explain the meaning of the term &ldquo;average rate of change.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Estimate or calculate the average rate of change between two points from the graph of a function.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities </strong>that will help you reach those goals:</p>
