<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Use function notation to write equations that represent exponential relationships. </li>
<li> Determine whether the relationships in descriptions, tables, equations, or graphs are functions. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li> 5.8.1: Meaning of a Function Presented Graphically </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you reviewed the meaning of a function presented graphically. Interpreting the graph in terms of the context helped prepare you for your work with functions in the rest of the unit. </li>
</ul>
<li> 5.8.2: Represent a Function as a Table of Values, Graph, and Equation </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you represented a situation using a table of values, a graph, and an equation. </li>

<ul>
</ul>
<li> 5.8.3: Using Function Language and Notation </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you revisited describing and analyzing situations involving exponential change, using graphs, tables, and equations, viewing them as functions and expressing them using function language and notation. </li>

<ul>
</ul>
<li> 5.8.4: Function Notation </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you considered a situation as a function of time in years, determined the meaning of a point in this context, and wrote an equation using function notation to represent the situation. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
