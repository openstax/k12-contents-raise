<h4>Write the Equation of a Line Given the Slope and a Point</h4>
<p>Writing an equation using the slope-intercept form works well when you are given the slope and
  \(y\)-intercept. If you are given the slope and another point that is not the \(y\)-intercept, we need another form of
  the equation of a line. </p>
<p>The point-slope form of an equation of a line can be derived from the formula for slope. Suppose
  you have a line that has slope \(m\) and that contains some specific point \( (x_1, y_1) \) as point 1 and some
  other point, \( (x, y) \), as point 2. You can write the slope of this line and then change it to a different
  form.</p>
<p>The point-slope form of an equation of a line with slope \(m\) and containing the point \( (x_1, y_1)
  \) is: \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \). You can use this form to find the equation of a line when you are given the slope
  and a point.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1 </strong></p>
<p>Write the equation of a line with slope \( m = -\frac{1}{3} \) that contains the point \( (6, -4) \).
  Write the equation in slope-intercept form. </p>
<p><strong>Step 1 - </strong> Identify the slope. <br>
  The slope is given.<br>
  \( m = \frac{1}{3} \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Identify the point.<br>
  The point is given.<br>
  \( (x_1, y_1) \)<br>
  \( (6, -4) \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Substitute the values into the point-slope form, \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \).
  Simplify.<br>
  \(\begin{array}{rcl}y-y_1&amp;=&amp;m(x-x_1)\\y-(-4)&amp;=&amp;\frac13(x-6)\\y+4&amp;=&amp;\frac13x+2\end{array}\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 - </strong> Write the equation in slope-intercept form.<br>
  \( y = \frac{1}{3}x -2 \)</p>
<br>
<p>To find an equation of a line given the slope and a point, follow these steps:</p>

<br>
<p><strong>Example 2 </strong></p>
<p>Find the equation of a horizontal line that contains the point \( (&ndash;2, &ndash;6)
  \). Write the equation in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 - </strong> Identify the slope. Every horizontal line has slope 0.<br>
  \( m = 0 \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Identify the point.<br>
  \( (x_1, y_1) \)<br>
  \( (&ndash;2, &ndash;6) \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Substitute the values into the point-slope form, \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \).
  Simplify.<br>
  \(\begin{array}{rcl}y-y_1&amp;=&amp;m(x-x_1)\\y-(-6)&amp;=&amp;0(x-(-2))\\y+6&amp;=&amp;0\end{array}\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 - </strong> Write the equation in slope-intercept form.<br>
  \( y = -6 \)<br>
  \( y = 0x - 6 \)</p>
