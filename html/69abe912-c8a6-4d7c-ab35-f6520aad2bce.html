<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Find the greatest common factor of two or more expressions. </li>
<li> Factor the greatest common factor from a polynomial. </li>
<li> Factor by grouping. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the<strong> activities </strong>that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li> 6.4.1: Finding Factors </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you reviewed how to find the factors of a number, monomial, or group of terms. This is an important skill used in factoring polynomials later in the lesson. </li>
</ul>
<li> 6.4.2: Finding the GCF of Two or More Expressions </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you found all the factors of two or more expressions and used that list to find their greatest common factor. </li>
<li> 6.4.2: Self Check </li>
<li>6.4.2: Additional Resources</li>
</ul>
<li> 6.4.3: Factoring the GCF from Polynomials </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you found the GCF of two or more expressions and then factored it out of those terms using the &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; of the Distributive Property. </li>
<li> 6.4.3: Self Check </li>
<li>6.4.3: Additional Resources</li>
</ul>
<li> 6.4.4: Factoring Polynomials by Grouping </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you recognized terms in an expression that shared factors and grouped them together to factor the polynomial. </li>
<li> 6.4.4: Self Check </li>
<li>6.4.4: Additional Resources</li>
</ul>
<li> 6.4.5: Can you Factor the Polynomial? </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you used everything you learned in the lesson to determine if polynomials can be factored. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li> 6.4.6: Practice </li>
