  <p dir="ltr">In this lesson, you will write and solve inequalities to answer questions about a situation. You will also practice finding the solution set to an inequality by reasoning about its composition and parts. <br></p>


  <p dir="ltr">When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
</span>
<ul>
  <li>Analyze the structure of an inequality in one variable to help determine if the solution is greater or less than the solution to the related equation.</li>
  <li>Write and solve inequalities to answer questions about a situation.</li>
</ul> 

<p>Below are the knowledge and skills you will practice in this lesson. Before you begin, read each one and rate how much you currently know about each one. It’s okay if your ratings are low; the purpose of this is to check in with yourself about what you do or do not yet know.</p>
