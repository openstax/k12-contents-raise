<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>The motion of a falling object is commonly modeled with a quadratic function. This activity prompts students to build
  a very simple quadratic model using given time-distance data of a free-falling rock. By reasoning repeatedly about the
  values in the data, students notice regularity in the relationship between time and the vertical distance the object
  travels, which they then generalize as an expression with a squared variable. The work here prepares students to make
  sense of more complex quadratic functions later (that is, to model the motion of an object that is launched up and
  then returns to the ground).</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Display the image of the falling object for all to see. Students will recognize the numbers from the warm up. Invite
  students to make some other observations about the information. Ask questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> &ldquo;What do you think the numbers tell us?&rdquo; </li>
  <li> &ldquo;Does the object fall the same distance every successive second? How do you know?&rdquo; </li>
</ul>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Tell students to think quietly about the first question and share their thinking
  with a partner. Afterward, consider pausing for a brief discussion before proceeding to the second question.</p>

<h4>Student Activity </h4>
<p>A rock is dropped from the top floor of a 500-foot-tall building. A camera captures the distance the rock traveled,
  in feet, after each second.</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>How many feet will the rock have fallen after 6 seconds? Be prepared to explain your reasoning.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The rock will have fallen 500 feet after 6 seconds. The distance fallen increased with
    each additional second. The rock fell 144 feet between 4 and 5 seconds, so between 5 and 6 seconds, it would fall
    more than 144 feet. After 5 seconds of falling, there is less than 144 feet to go before the rock hits the ground.
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Jada noticed that the distances fallen are all multiples of 16.<br>
    <br>
    She wrote down:<br>
    <br>
    \(16=16 \cdot 1\)<br>
    \(64=16 \cdot 4\)<br>
    \(144=16 \cdot 9\)<br>
    \(256=16 \cdot 16\)<br>
    \(400=16 \cdot 25\)
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Then, she noticed that 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25 are \(1^2\), \(2^2\), \(3^2\), \(4^2\), \(5^2\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
    <li> Use Jada&rsquo;s observations to predict the distance fallen in feet after 7 seconds. (Assume the building is
      tall enough that an object dropped from the top of it will continue falling for at least 7 seconds.) Be prepared
      to explain your reasoning. <br>

    <li> Write an equation for the function, with \(d\) representing the distance dropped after \(t\) seconds. </li>

<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(d=16 \cdot t^2\)</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may question why the distances are positive when the rock is falling. In earlier grades, negative
  numbers represented on a vertical number line may have been associated with an arrow pointing down. Emphasize that the
  values shown in the picture measure how far the rock fell and not the direction it is falling.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Discuss the equation students wrote for the last question. If not already mentioned by students, point out that the
  \(t^2\) suggests a quadratic relationship between elapsed time and the distance that a falling object travels. Ask
  students:</p>
<ul>
  <li> &ldquo;How do you know that the equation \(d=16t^2\) represents a function?&rdquo; (For every input of time,
    there is a particular output.) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;Suppose we want to know if the rock will travel 600 feet before 6 seconds have elapsed. How can we find
    out?&rdquo; (Find the value of \(d\) when \(t\) is 6, which is \(16 \cdot 6^2\) or 576 feet.) </li>
</ul>
<p>Explain to students that we only have a few data points to go by in this case, and the quadratic expression \(16t^2\)
  is a simplified model, but quadratic functions are generally used to model the movement of falling objects. We will
  see this expression appearing in some other contexts where gravity affects the quantities being studied.</p>

<h4>Finding Distance Fallen</h4>
<p>The Empire State Building is 1250 ft high (excluding the lightning rod). A visitor drops a penny from the top, and it
  falls straight down. How far has it fallen after 5 seconds?</p>
<p>Recall the previous activity&rsquo;s formula \(h(t)=16t^2\).</p>
<p>Substitute \(t=5\).</p>
<p>\(h(5)=16(5)^2=16 \cdot 25=400\) feet.</p>
<h4>Try It: Finding Distance Fallen</h4>
<p>Will the penny dropped from the Empire State Building reach the ground after 9 seconds? Be prepared to show your
  reasoning.</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution </h5>
<p>Here is how to determine if the penny will hit the ground by 9 seconds:</p>
<p>Substitute \(t=9\) into \(h(t)=16t^2\).</p>
<p>\(h(9)=16(9)^2=16 \cdot 81=1296\)</p>
<p>After 9 seconds, the penny could travel 1296 feet. The Empire State Building is 1250 feet tall, so the penny will
  have hit the ground by 9 seconds.</p>
