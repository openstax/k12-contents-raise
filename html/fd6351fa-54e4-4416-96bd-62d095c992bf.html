<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity further develops the idea of equivalent equations and does so in the context of a situation. Students
  pay attention to the moves that create equations with the same solution and those that don&rsquo;t. They also make
  sense of both the moves and the solutions in terms of the given situation. The work here gives students opportunities
  to reason concretely and abstractly. In an upcoming lesson, they will think about why these moves lead to equations
  with the same solution.</p>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2 and provide access to calculators. Ask students to read the opening paragraph and
  display the equation \( x - 0.1x + 2.70 = 56.70 \) for all to see. Ask students to explain
  how the equation represents Noah&rsquo;s purchase.</p>
<p>Then, give students a couple of minutes to discuss the first two questions with their partner and ask them to pause for a
  whole-class discussion. Once students understand that the solution to the equation is the original price of a pair of
  jeans and that substituting 60 for \( x \) makes the equation true, move on to
  the rest of the activity.</p>
<p>Tell students that they will see a series of equations that are related to the original equation and that can be
  interpreted in terms of the situation. For each equation, their job is to determine either what move was made to the
  original equation, or what the equation means in context. Next, they should check if the equation has the same
  solution as the original. (To help students understand the task and if needed, consider working on questions 3-5 as a
  class.)</p>
<p>If time is limited, ask one partner in each group to take the equations from questions 3, 9, and 15 and the other partner to take the equations from questions 6, 12, and 18.

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>With a partner, discuss the following situations and equations. For each, consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    What does the solution mean in the context of the situation?
  </li>
  <li>
    Are the given values solutions?
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If operations are applied correctly, the solution to an equation is also the solution to all equations equivalent to
  it. If operations are incorrectly applied, the solution of each equation is different.</p>
<p>For numbers 1 and 2, use the following situation and equation:</p>
<p>Noah is buying a pair of jeans and using a coupon for 10% off. The total price is $56.70, which includes $2.70 in
  sales tax. Noah&rsquo;s purchase can be modeled by the equation:</p>
<p>\(x−0.1x+2.70=56.70\)</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>
    What does the solution to the equation mean in this situation?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.<br>
  The solution is the price of a pair of jeans.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>
    How can you verify that 70 is not a solution but 60 is the solution?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here are some samples.</p>
<p>70 can be substituted into the equation to make a false statement:<br>
  \(70−0.1(70)+2.70=56.70\)<br>
  \(65.70 &ne; 56.70\) &#10060;</p>
<p>60 can be substituted into the equation to make a true statement:<br>

  60−0.1(60)+2.70=56.70\)<br>
  \(56.70=56.70\)  \(\checkmark\) </p>
<p>Here are some equations that are related to \(x−0.1x+2.70=56.70\). Each equation is a result of performing one or

<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>Display the original equation and the equations from questions 3, 6, 9. 12, 15, and 18 for all to see.<br>
  
Original Equation (Noah's) = x - 0.1x + 2.70 = 56.70<br>
Equation A (question 3) = 100x - 10x + 270 = 5,670<br>
Equation B (question 6) = x - 0.1x = 54<br>
Equation C (question 9) = 0.9x + 2.70 = 56.70<br>
Equation D (question 12) = x - 0.1x = 56.70<br>
Equation E (question 15) = x - 0.1x = 59.40<br>
Equation F (question 18) = 2(x - 0.1x + 2.70) = 56.70<br>


Invite students to share what was done to
  the original equation to get each of those equations and whether they have the same solution. Along the way,
  compile a list of moves that lead to equations with the same solution and those that lead to different
  solutions. </p>
<p>Ask students to observe the list and see what kinds of moves produce Equations A&ndash;C and D&ndash;F. Record
  the moves that create equations with the same solutions, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>adding or multiplying both sides of the equal sign by the same number.</li>
  <li>applying properties of operations (commutative, associative, or distributive).</li>
  <li>combining like terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also record the moves that create equations with different solutions, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>adding or multiplying a different number to the two sides, or performing an operation to only one side.</li>
  <li>adding different expressions to the two sides.</li>
  <li>performing different operations on each side.</li>
</ul>
<p>(The lists don&rsquo;t need to be comprehensive because students will examine these moves more closely later.)
</p>
<p>Next, give students a couple of examples of how the equations and their solutions could be interpreted in
  context. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Equation A shows the cost calculation in cents, so the original price of a pair of jeans is unchanged.</li>
  <li>Equation D shows the discounted price, excluding tax, to be $56.70, but in the original
    equation, the price $56.70 included tax. This means that, in Equation D, the original price of
    one pair of jeans is different from the first equation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Prompt students to interpret 1&ndash;2 other equations and to explain why the solution in each equation (or the
  price of one pair of jeans) is equal or unequal to that in the initial equation. Here are possible
  interpretations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Equation B shows the discounted price before sales tax to be $54, which is $2.70
    less than $56.70. This is also the case in the initial equation, so the original price of the
    jeans is still the same. </li>
  <li>Equation C shows the discounted price as 90% of the original price, which is the same as 10% less than the
    original price (100%). The original price is unchanged.</li>
  <li>Equation E shows the discounted price, before tax, to be $59.40. This is more than the pre-tax
    price in the initial equation, so the original price of the jeans here must be higher.</li>
  <li>Equation F shows the price of 2 pairs of jeans, including the discount and tax, to be $56.70.
    This means the price of a pair of jeans must be much less than in the initial equation.</li>
</ul>

<p>For equations to be equivalent, inverse operations are used and must be applied to both sides of an equation so
  it remains balanced.</p>
<p>Inverse operations are operations that &ldquo;undo&rdquo; other operations.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1 </strong></p>
<p>Solve \( 3x =15 \).</p>
<p>Since 3 is being multiplied by \( x \), to solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 3.</p>
<p>\( \frac{3x}{3}=\frac{15}{3} \)</p>
<p>\( x=5 \)</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 1 - </strong>Subtract 4 from both sides.<br>
  \(\frac{x}{2}+4−4=12−4\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Simplify.<br>
  \(\frac{x}{2}=8\)</p>

<p>
  <strong>STEP 1:</strong> Identify the variable. <br>
  \(g\): cost for one pound of grapes<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Step 2: </strong>Write an equation.<br>
  \(6g=10.74\)<br>
  <br>
  <strong>STEP 3:</strong> Solve for g.<br>
