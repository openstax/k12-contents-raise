<h2>Activity (15 minutes)</h2>
<p>This activity further develops the idea of equivalent equations and does so in the context of a situation. Students
  pay attention to the moves that create equations with the same solution and those that don&rsquo;t. They also make
  sense of both the moves and the solutions in terms of the given situation. The work here gives students opportunities
  to reason concretely and abstractly. In an upcoming lesson, they will think about why these moves lead to equations
  with the same solution.</p>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2 and provide access to calculators. Ask students to read the opening paragraph and
  display the equation \( x - 0.1x + 2.70 = 56.70 \) for all to see. Ask students to explain
  how the equation represents Noah&rsquo;s purchase.</p>
<p>Then, give students a couple of minutes to discuss the first question with their partner and ask them to pause for a
  whole-class discussion. Once students understand that the solution to the equation is the original price of a pair of
  jeans and that substituting 60 for \( x \) makes the equation true, move on to
  the rest of the activity.</p>
<p>Tell students that they will see a series of equations that are related to the original equation and that can be
  interpreted in terms of the situation. For each equation, their job is to determine either what move was made to the
  original equation, or what the equation means in context. Next, they should check if the equation has the same
  solution as the original. (To help students understand the task and if needed, consider working on Equation A as a
  class.)</p>
<p>If time is limited, ask one partner in each group to take Equations A, C, E and the other partner to take B, D, F.

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>With a partner, discuss the following situations and their equations. When talking about each equation, you will
  need to discuss what the solution means in the context of the situation and if certain values are in fact solutions.
</p>
<p>Remember, if equations are equivalent and operations are applied correctly to both sides, the solution remains the
  same in all equivalent equations. If the operations are not applied to both sides properly, the solution would
  change.</p>
<p>1. Noah is buying a pair of jeans and using a coupon for 10% off. The total price is $56.70, which includes $2.70
  in sales tax. Noah&rsquo;s purchase can be modeled by the equation:</p>
<p>\( x - 0.1x + 2.70 = 56.70 \)</p>
<p>Discuss with a partner:</p>
<p>a. What does the solution to the equation mean in this situation?</p>
<p>b. How can you verify that 70 is not a solution but 60 is the solution?</p>
<p>2. Here are some equations that are related to \( x - 0.1x + 2.70 = 56.70 \). Each equation is a result of
  performing one or more moves on that original equation. Each can also be interpreted in terms of Noah&rsquo;s
  purchase.</p>
<p>For each equation, determine either what move was made or how the equation could be interpreted. (Some
  examples are given here.) Then, check if 60 is the solution of the equation.</p>

<p>4. Which of the six equations are equivalent to the original equation? Be prepared to explain how you know.</p>
<h3>Student Response</h3>
<p>1. Compare your answer:</p>
<p>a. The solution is the price of a pair of jeans.</p>
<p>b. 70 can be substituted into the equation to make a false statement: </p>
<p> \( 70-0.1(70) + 2.70 = 56.70 \)</p>
<p> \( 65.70 = 56.70 \) False</p>
<p> 60 can be substituted into the equation and make a true statement: </p>
<p> \( 60-0.1(60) + 2.70 = 56.70 \)</p>
<p> \( 56.70 = 56.70 \) True</p>
<p>2. Compare your answer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Equation A: Every term was multiplied by 100. The equation is equivalent to Noah&rsquo;s equation. The price
    is now expressed in cents instead of dollars. 60 is a solution.</li>
  <li>Equation B: Subtract 2.70 from both sides of the equation. The answer is still in dollars. 60 is a solution.
  </li>
  <li>Equation C: \( x \) and \( 0.1x \) were correctly combined to create an equivalent equation to Noah&rsquo;s
    original equation. 10% off means paying 90% of the original price. 90% of the original price plus sales tax is
    $56.70. 60 is still a solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Sample responses</p>
<ul>
  <li>Equation D: Sales tax was not included on the left but is included on the right. This equation is not
    equivalent to Noah&rsquo;s original equation. The price after using the coupon for 10% off before sales tax is
    not the same as the price after using the coupon for 10% off including the sales tax, $56.70. 60 is not a
    solution.</li>
  <li>Equation E: Subtract 2.70 from the left and add 2.70 to the right. The same operation must be done to both
    sides of an equation to keep it balanced and to create an equivalent equation. The price after using the
    coupon for 10% off is not equal to 56.70 plus tax. 60 is not a solution.</li>
  <li>Equation F: The left side was multiplied by 2. Two pairs of jeans after the 10% discount and sales tax cost
    56.70. 60 is not a solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>4. For example: Equations A, B, C were equivalent to the original. Interpreting equations can help you
  understand the cost of items you buy!</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
</ol>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>Display the original equation and Equations A&ndash;F for all to see. Invite students to share what was done to
  the original equation to get each of those equations and whether they have the same solution. Along the way,
  compile a list of moves that lead to equations with the same solution and those that lead to different
  solutions. </p>
<p>Ask students to observe the list and see what kinds of moves produce Equations A&ndash;C and D&ndash;F. Record
  the moves that create equations with the same solutions, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>adding or multiplying both sides of the equal sign by the same number.</li>
  <li>applying properties of operations (commutative, associative, or distributive).</li>
  <li>combining like terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also record the moves that create equations with different solutions, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>adding or multiplying a different number to the two sides, or performing an operation to only one side.</li>
  <li>adding different expressions to the two sides.</li>
  <li>performing different operations on each side.</li>
</ul>
<p>(The lists don&rsquo;t need to be comprehensive because students will examine these moves more closely later.)
</p>
<p>Next, give students a couple of examples of how the equations and their solutions could be interpreted in
  context. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Equation A shows the cost calculation in cents, so the original price of a pair of jeans is unchanged.</li>
  <li>Equation D shows the discounted price, excluding tax, to be $56.70, but in the original
    equation, the price $56.70 included tax. This means that, in Equation D, the original price of
    one pair of jeans is different from the first equation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Prompt students to interpret 1&ndash;2 other equations and to explain why the solution in each equation (or the
  price of one pair of jeans) is equal or unequal to that in the initial equation. Here are possible
  interpretations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Equation B shows the discounted price before sales tax to be $54, which is $2.70
    less than $56.70. This is also the case in the initial equation, so the original price of the
    jeans is still the same. </li>
  <li>Equation C shows the discounted price as 90% of the original price, which is the same as 10% less than the
    original price (100%). The original price is unchanged.</li>
  <li>Equation E shows the discounted price, before tax, to be $59.40. This is more than the pre-tax
    price in the initial equation, so the original price of the jeans here must be higher.</li>
  <li>Equation F shows the price of 2 pairs of jeans, including the discount and tax, to be $56.70.
    This means the price of a pair of jeans must be much less than in the initial equation.</li>
</ul>

<p> <br>When you add, subtract, multiply, or divide the same quantity from both sides of an equation, you
  still have equality.</p>
<p>For equations to be equivalent, inverse operations are used and must be applied to both sides of an equation so
  it remains balanced.</p>
<p>Inverse operations are operations that &ldquo;undo&rdquo; other operations.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1 </strong></p>
<p>Solve \( 3x =15 \).</p>
<p>Since 3 is being multiplied by \( x \), to solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 3.</p>
<p>\( \frac{3x}{3}=\frac{15}{3} \)</p>
<p>\( x=5 \)</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Subtract 4 from both sides.<br>
  \(\frac{x}{2}+4−4=12−4\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Simplify.<br>
  \(\frac{x}{2}=8\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Multiply both sides by 2.<br>
  \(2 \times \frac{x}{2}=8 \times 2\)</p>
