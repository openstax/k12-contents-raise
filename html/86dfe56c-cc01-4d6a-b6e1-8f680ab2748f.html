<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>In the first activity, students rewrote quadratic expressions whose squared term has a coefficient of 1 into vertex
  form. They did so by completing the square. In this activity, they transform expressions whose squared term has a
  coefficient other than 1 into vertex form.</p>
<p>Students learn that one way to deal with an inconvenient \(a\) in \(ax^2+bx+c\) is to rewrite the expression as a
  product of \(a\) and an expression (which now has a leading coefficient of 1), complete the square for the latter, and
  redistribute \(a\) afterward to obtain an equivalent expression in vertex form.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Keep students in groups of two. Display these expressions for all to see and explain that these are some other
  expressions to rewrite in vertex form so that we could identify the vertex of their graph.</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> \(3x^2+12x+9\) </li>
  <li> \(-2x^2&minus;4x+6\) </li>
  <li> \(4x^2+24x+20\) </li>
  <li> \(-x^2+20x\) </li>
</ul>
<p>Give students one minute of quiet time to think individually and ask them to be prepared to share at least one thing
  they notice and one thing they wonder.</p>
<p>Students may notice:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> In all of the expressions, the coefficient of the squared term is not 1. </li>
  <li> Each of the expressions contains terms that have a common factor. </li>
  <li> The coefficients of some squared terms are negative. </li>
  <li> The last expression has no constant term. </li>
</ul>
<p>Students may wonder:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> How to write these expressions in vertex form. </li>
  <li> Whether it is still possible to write the last expression in vertex form given that it has no constant term.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Invite a few students to share what they noticed and wondered, and then begin the activity.</p>
<p>Pause for a class discussion after the first question. Display the worked example. Ask students to share their
  explanation for each step and record their explanation for all to see. Make sure students understand the rationale for
  each step and how to check that their expression is equivalent to the original (by converting it back into standard
  form).</p>
<p>Students have learned in an earlier unit that a positive \(a\) in \(a(x&minus;h)^2+k\) means an upward-opening graph
  and may offer this explanation for the last part of the question. It is not necessary to focus on the direction of the
  opening of the parabola here, as students will explore it further in an upcoming lesson.</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The zeros of \(f\) are 3 and 9. Because the graph of a quadratic function has a vertical
  line of symmetry across the vertex, the vertex of the graph must have \(x\)-coordinate 6. The \(y\)-coordinate of the
  vertex is -18 because \(f(6)=-18\). This means \(f(x)\) can be expressed as \(a(x&minus;6)^2&minus;18\). If we expand
  \(2(x&minus;3)(x&minus;9)\), we can see that the coefficient of \(x^2\) is 2. This means that \(a\) in the vertex form
  has to be 2 as well. In vertex form the correct answer is \(2(x-6)^2 - 18\).</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 3</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6" type="a">
  <li>Be prepared to show your reasoning for your answers.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Although 3 and 9 are not zeros of \(g\), when \(x\) is 3 and when \(x\) is 9, \(g(x)\) is
  21, or \(g(3)=g(9)=21\). Because the graphs of quadratic functions are symmetric, the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex
  is still 6. The \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex is 3 because \(g(6)=3\). The value of \(a\) is 2 for the same reason as
  in function \(f\). In vertex form the correct answer is \(2(x-6)^2 + 3\)</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students to display their responses for all to see. Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> "How did you know what factor to use to rewrite the original expression?" (Find a factor that all terms in an
    expression have in common. Use the coefficient of the squared term so that, after the expression is rewritten, the
    squared term has a coefficient of 1.) </li>
  <li> "In \(4x^2+24x+20\), both 2 and 4 are common factors. Is one number better than the other for our purposes here?"
    (4 is a better factor to use because it allows the squared term to have a coefficient of 1, which makes it easier to
    complete the square. If we use 2, the squared term still has an inconvenient coefficient that is neither 1 nor a
    perfect square.) </li>
  <li> "How can we check if the expression in vertex form is equivalent to the original expression?" (One way is to
    convert it back into standard form and see if it is the same expression as the original.) </li>
</ul>
