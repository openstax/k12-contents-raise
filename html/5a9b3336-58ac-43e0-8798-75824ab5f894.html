<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>Students have seen quadratic expressions in both standard form and factored form since the beginning of the unit. In
  this activity, they learn to distinguish the expressions by their forms and to refer to each form by its formal name.
  Refining their language about the different forms prepares students to be more precise in their thinking about the
  graphs of quadratic functions in later lessons.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Give students quiet work time and then time to share their work with a partner.

    <p>Use this routine to help students improve their writing by providing them with multiple opportunities to clarify their explanations through conversation. Give students time to meet with one to two partners to share their response to the final question, “Why do you think that form is called factored form?” Provide listeners with prompts for feedback that will help their partner add detail to strengthen and clarify their ideas. For example, students can ask their partner, “Can you say more about what each expression means?” or “I understand _____, but can you clarify . . .” Next, provide students with two to three minutes to revise their initial draft based on feedback from their peers.</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>What are some characteristics of expressions in standard form?</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Answer:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The standard form always starts with an \(x^2\) term and is in decreasing order of degree. </li>
  <li> It does not need to have an \(x\) term or a numerical term. </li>
  <li> Standard form is \(ax^2+bx+c\) where \(a\) is not zero. </li>
  <li> The standard form shows a sum or difference of terms. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>\((x+1)(x-1)\) and \((2x+3)x\) in the right column are quadratic expressions written in factored form. Why do you
    think that form is called factored form?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> It is a product of two factors. Each factor could be a variable, a number, or an expression
  with a variable (with no exponent) and a number.</p>
<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>Which quadratic expression can be described as being both standard form and factored form? Explain how you know.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong> \(x^2\) could be viewed as both standard and factored. It has an \(x^2\) term even though
  there is not a constant or linear term. It can also be written as the product of two linear expressions because
  \(x^2\) is equal to \(x \cdot x\).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Display the two columns of expressions for all to see. Solicit students&rsquo; ideas on the features of each form.
  Record their responses for all to see. Invite other students to express agreement or disagreement, or to clarify their
  fellow students&rsquo; responses.</p>
<p>Define a quadratic expression in standard form explicitly as \(ax^2+bx+c\). Explain that we refer to \(a\) as the
  coefficient of the squared term \(x^2\), \(b\) as the coefficient of the linear term \(x\), and \(c\) as the constant
  term.</p>
<p>Ask students:</p>
<ul>
  <li> &ldquo;How would you write \((2x+3)x\) in standard form?&rdquo; \((2x^2+3x)\) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;The expression \(2x^2+3x\) only has two terms. Is it still in standard form?&rdquo; (Yes, there is no
    constant term, which means \(c\) is \(0\).) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;How would you write \(-4(x^2+14x)+7\) in standard form?&rdquo; \((-4x^2-56x+7)\) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;What are the values of the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) in the expression \(-4x^2-x+7\)?&rdquo; (\(&ndash;
    4\) and \(&ndash; 1\)) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;What about the constant term?&rdquo; (\(7\)) </li>
</ul>
<p>Then, clarify that a quadratic expression in factored form is a product of two factors that are each a linear
  expression. For example, \((x+1)(x-1)\),\((2x+3)x\), and \(x(4x)\) all have two linear expressions for their factors.
  An expression with two factors that are linear expressions and a third factor that is a constant, for example:
  \(2(x+2)(x-1)\), is also in factored form.</p>
<p>Tell students that each form gives us interesting or useful information about the function that the expression
  represents, and they will learn more about this in future lessons.</p>

<h4>Try It: Standard Form of Quadratics</h4>

<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to determine if the expression is in standard form:</p>
<p>This expression is in factored form. If the \(4x\) is distributed, the expression becomes \(4x^2-8x\), which is in
  standard form.</p>
