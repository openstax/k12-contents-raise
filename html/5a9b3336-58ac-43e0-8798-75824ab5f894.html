<h3>Activity (10 minutes)</h3>
<p>Students have seen quadratic expressions in both standard form and factored form since the beginning of the unit. In this activity, they learn to distinguish the expressions by their forms and to refer to each form by its formal name. Refining their language about the different forms prepares students to be more precise in their thinking about the graphs of quadratic functions in later lessons.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Give students quiet work time and then time to share their work with a partner.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>The quadratic expression \(x^2+4x+3\) is written in standard form.</p>
<p>Here are some other quadratic expressions. The expressions on the left are written in standard form and the expressions on the right are not.</p>

<li>What are some characteristics of expressions in standard form?</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> The standard form always starts with an \(x^2\) term and is in decreasing order of degree. </li>
<li> It does not need to have an \(x\) term or a numerical term. </li>
<li> Standard form is \(ax^2+bx+c\) where \(a\) is not zero. </li>
<li> The standard form shows a sum or difference of terms. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li>\((x+1)(x-1)\) and \((2x+3)x\) in the right column are quadratic expressions written in factored form. Why do you think that form is called factored form?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> It is a product of two factors. Each factor could be a variable, a number, or an expression with a variable (with no exponent) and a number.</p>
<h4>Student-Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>Which quadratic expression can be described as being both standard form and factored form? Explain how you know.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong> \(x^2\) could be viewed as both standard and factored. It has an \(x^2\) term even though there is not a constant or linear term. It can also be written as the product of two linear expressions because \(x^2\) is equal to \(x \cdot x\).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Display the two columns of expressions for all to see. Solicit students&rsquo; ideas on the features of each form. Record their responses for all to see. Invite other students to express agreement or disagreement, or to clarify their fellow students&rsquo; responses.</p>
<p>Define a quadratic expression in standard form explicitly as \(ax^2+bx+c\). Explain that we refer to \(a\) as the coefficient of the squared term \(x^2\), \(b\) as the coefficient of the linear term \(x\), and \(c\) as the constant term.</p>
<p>Ask students:</p>
<ul>
<li> &ldquo;How would you write \((2x+3)x\) in standard form?&rdquo; \((2x^2+3x)\) </li>
<li> &ldquo;The expression \(2x^2+3x\) only has two terms. Is it still in standard form?&rdquo; (Yes, there is no constant term, which means \(c\) is \(0\).) </li>
<li> &ldquo;How would you write \(-4(x^2+14x)+7\) in standard form?&rdquo; \((-4x^2-56x+7)\) </li>
<li> &ldquo;What are the values of the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) in the expression \(-4x^2-x+7\)?&rdquo; (\(&ndash; 4\) and \(&ndash; 1\)) </li>
<li> &ldquo;What about the constant term?&rdquo; (\(7\)) </li>
</ul>
<p>Then, clarify that a quadratic expression in factored form is a product of two factors that are each a linear expression. For example, \((x+1)(x-1)\),\((2x+3)x\), and \(x(4x)\) all have two linear expressions for their factors. An expression with two factors that are linear expressions and a third factor that is a constant, for example: \(2(x+2)(x-1)\), is also in factored form.</p>
<p>Tell students that each form gives us interesting or useful information about the function that the expression represents, and they will learn more about this in future lessons.</p>

<h3>7.9.3: Additional Resources</h3>

<h4>Standard Form of Quadratics</h4>
<p><strong>Examples of Standard Form Quadratics</strong></p>
<p>\(x^2\)</p>
<p>\(x^2-9\)</p>
<p>\(x^2-3x\)</p>
<p>\(x^2+4x-45\)</p>
<p>These examples have an \(x^2\) and lead with it. Some have an \(x\) term or a constant term but it is not needed to be in standard form. Standard form of a quadratic expression is of the form \(ax^2+bx+c\), where \(a \neq 0\).</p>
<p><strong>Non-Examples of Standard Form Quadratics</strong></p>
<p>\(7-x\)</p>
<p>\(9(x-2)\)</p>
<p>\(x(x+10)\)</p>
<p>These examples do not have an \(x^2\) term.</p>
<h4>Try It: Standard Form of Quadratics</h4>
<p>Determine if \(4x(x-2)\) is a quadratic in standard form.</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to determine if the expression is in standard form:</p>
<p>This expression is in factored form. If the \(4x\) is distributed, the expression becomes \(4x^2-8x\), which is in standard form.</p>
