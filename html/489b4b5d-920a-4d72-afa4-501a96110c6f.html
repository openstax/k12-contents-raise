<h4>Choosing Which Equation to Use</h4>
<p>A relationship between quantities
  can be described in more than one way. Some ways are more helpful than
  others, depending on what we want to find out. Let’s look at the angles
  of an isosceles triangle, for example.</p>
<div class="os-raise-d-flex os-raise-justify-content-between">
<img alt="Triangle with angles labeled a, b, and a." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4dd78e58c323915d1b1394785533170a4ef8149b"/>
<p>The two angles near the horizontal side<br/> have equal measurement in degrees, \(a\).<br/><br/>
    The sum of angles in a triangle is<br/> \(180\circ\) , so the relationship between<br/> the angles can be expressed as:<br/><br/>
    \(a+a+b=180\)
  </p>
</div>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Suppose we want to find \(a\) when \(b\) is \(20^\circ\).</p>
<p>\( a+a+b=180 \)<br/>\( 2a+20=180 \)<br/>\( 2a=180-20 \)<br/>\( 2a=160 \)</p>
<p>\( a=80 \)</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>What is the value of \(b\) if \(a\) is \(72.5^\circ\)?</p>
<p>\( a+a+b=180 \)<br/>\( 72.5+72.5+b=80 \)<br/>\( 145+b=180 \)<br/>\( b=35 \)</p>
<p>Notice that when \(b\) is given, we did the same calculation repeatedly to find \(a\): We substituted \(b\) into the
  first equation, subtracted \(b\) from 180, and then divided the result by 2. </p>
<p>Instead of taking these steps over and over whenever we know \( b \)
  and want to find \( a \), we can rearrange the equation to isolate
  \( a \):</p>
<p>\( a+a+b=180 \)<br/>\( 2a+b=180 \)<br/>\( 2a=180-b \)<br/>\( a=\frac{180-b}{2} \)<br/>\( a=90-\frac{1}{2}b \)</p>
<p>This equation is equivalent to the first one. To find \( a \), we can
  now simply substitute any value of \( b \) into this equation and
  evaluate the expression on the right side.</p>
<p>Likewise, we can write an equivalent equation to make it easier to find \( b \) when we know \( a \):</p>
<p>\( a+a+b=180 \)<br/>\( 2a+b=180 \)<br/>\( b=180-2a \)</p>
<p>Rearranging an equation to isolate one variable is called solving for
  a variable. In this example, we have solved for \( a \) and for
  \( b \). All three equations are equivalent. Depending on what
  information we have and what we are interested in, we can choose a
  particular equation to use.</p>

<p>Here is how to write an equation to find Bryce’s allowance.</p>
<p>Let \( j \): Jake’s allowance and \( b \): Bryce’s allowance.</p>
<p>\( j + 2b = 15 \)</p>
<p>Solve for \( b \) to find Bryce’s allowance.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 1:</strong> Subtract \(j\) from each side. <br/>
    \(j−j+2b=15−j\) </p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Simplify. <br/>
    \(2b=15−j\) </p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Divide both sides by 2. <br/>
    \(\frac{2b}{2}=\frac{15-j}{2}\)</p>
<br/>
<p>So to find Bryce’s allowance, use the equation: \( b=\frac{15-j}{2} \) or \( b=\frac{15}{2}-\frac{j}{2} \).</p>
