<p>To help students summarize key points from the lesson, discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> "How would you find the standard form of a quadratic function by analyzing its graph?" (Analyze its graph to determine the zeros of the function. Use the zeros of the function to write the function in factored form. Convert the factored form of the function into standard form.) </li>
  <li> "Can two different functions have the same zeros?" (Yes. Related quadratic functions have the same zeros and the same axis of symmetry when graphed.) </li>
  <li> "Describe in your own words how to find a specific quadratic function from its zeros and a point that it contains." (Use the zeros to find a function&rsquo;s intercept form using \(a\) as the multiplier. Substitute the point into the function and solve for the value of \(a\). Substitute that value back into the intercept form of the equation and distribute the value.) </li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
