  <p><strong><em>Students will complete the following questions to practice the skills they have learned in this lesson.<br></em></strong></p>
  <p>For 1-2, use this situation:</p>
  <blockquote><p>Jada has<em> p</em> pennies and <em>n</em> nickels that add up to more than 40 cents. She has fewer than 20 coins altogether.</p></blockquote>
  
<p>1. Which two inequalities could make up a system of inequalities that represents how many pennies and nickels that Jada could have? Select <strong>two</strong> inequalities.</p>
<ul>
  <li>p+n&lt;20</li>
  <li>p+n&gt;20</li>
  <li>&nbsp;0.01p + 0.05n &lt;0.40</li>
  <li>&nbsp;0.01p + 0.05n &gt;0.40 </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>p+n&lt;20, 0.01p + 0.05n &gt;0.40 <br></p>
<p>\(p+n &lt; 20\) represents the total number of coins. The problem states that she has fewer than 20 coins. The number of pennies plus the number of nickels added together will be less than 20 coins.</p>
<p>\(0.01p+0.05n &gt; 0.40\) represents the value of each coin. The value of a penny is 1 cent (0.01) the value of a nickel is 5 cents (0.05). The number of pennies multiplied by its value of 0.01 plus the number of nickels multiplied by its value 0.05 will give the total amount of money she has. The problem states that she has more than 40 cents.</p>     
<p>For questions 2–4: <br><blockquote>Determine if it is possible that Jada has each of the following combinations of coins. If so, explain or show how you know. If not, state which constraint—the amount of money or the number of coins—it does not meet.</blockquote></p>
    
<p>2. 15 pennies and 5 nickels<br>
<strong>Answer:&nbsp; </strong>No. She has fewer than 20 coins.15+5=20, it is not less than 20</p>
<p>3. 16 pennies and 2 nickels<br>
<strong>Answer:&nbsp; </strong>No. She has more than 40 cents.16+2(5)=26, it is not more than 40 cents.</p>
<p>4. 10 pennies and 8 nickels<br>
<p><strong>Answer:&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;Yes.She has less than 20 coins.&nbsp; 10+8=18. That is less than 20 coins. She has more than 40 cents.&nbsp; 10+8(5)=50, which is&nbsp; more than 40 cents.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;A triathlon athlete swims at an average rate of 2.4 miles per hour and bikes at an average rate of 16.1 miles per hour. At the end of one training session, she has swum and biked more than 20 miles in total.</p>
<p>The inequality \(2.4s+16.1b&gt;20\) and this graph represent the relationship between the hours of swimming, \(s\), the hours of biking, \(b\), and the total distance the athlete could have traveled in miles. <br></p>

<p>Mai said, "I'm not sure the graph is right. For example, the point (10,3) is in the shaded region, but it's not realistic for an athlete to swim for 10 hours and bike for 3 hours in a training session! I think triathlon athletes generally train for no more than 2 hours a day."</p>
<p>Which&nbsp; inequality represents Mai's last statement?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>\(s+b\leq2\)</li>
    <li>\(s+b&lt;2\)</li>
    <li>\(s+b&gt;2\)</li>
    <li>\(s+b=2\)</li>
  </ul>
    <p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;\(s+b\;\leq\;2\)<br>
      Mai states that hours swimming, \(s\), plus hours on the bike, \(b\), are less than or equal to (since they train no more than) 2. This is represented by 
      \(s+b&le;2\).</p>
      <p>For questions 6 and 7, use the following situation and graph:<br>
        <blockquote>Elena is considering buying bracelets and necklaces as gifts for her friends. Bracelets, b,&nbsp; cost $3, and necklaces, n, cost $5. She can spend no more than $30 on the gifts. Elena needs at least 7 gift items.<br>
      This graph represents the inequality \(3b+5n&le;30\), which describes the cost constraint in this situation. <br>
      <img alt="Graph of inequality. Number of necklaces. Number of bracelets.
&nbsp;" class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="234" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/36aaa88b8c90a771168555b20386a933afa61233" width="315"></blockquote></p>
  <p>6. Let \(b\) represent the number of bracelets and \(n\) the number of necklaces.</p>
  <p>Which inequality represents the number of gift items that Elena  needs.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>\(b+n&gt;7\)</li>
    <li>\(b+n\geq7\)</li>
    <li>\(b+n&lt;7\)</li>
    <li>&nbsp;\(b+n=7\)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\(b+n\geq7\)</p>
  <p>Elena needs at least 7 gifts that are a combination of number of bracelets, \(b\), and number of necklaces, \(n\), so added together \(b+n\) must be greater or equal to 7. </p>


<p>7. Which of the following could be solutions to the system of inequalities? Select <strong>two</strong> answers.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>\(b+n\geq7\)</p>
<p>(7, 1), (6, 2) are possible solutions since when substituted into the inequality, 
  /(7+1&ge;7/) and /(6+2&ge;7/).</p>

  <p>8.&nbsp;A gardener is buying some topsoil and compost to fill his garden. His budget is $70. Topsoil costs $1.89 per cubic foot, and compost costs $4.59 per cubic foot.</p>
  <p>Select <strong>three</strong> statements or representations that correctly describe the gardener&rsquo;s constraints in this situation. Let \(t\) represent the cubic feet of topsoil and \(c\) the cubic feet of compost.</p>

<p>A: The combination of 7.5 cubic feet of topsoil and 12 cubic feet of compost is within the gardener&rsquo;s budget.<br>
</p>
<p>B: If the line represents the equation \(1.89t+4.59c=70\), this graph represents the solutions to the gardener&rsquo;s budget constraint.<br>

</p>
<br>
<p>C: \(1.89t+4.59c\geq70\)<br></p>
<p>D: The combination of 5 cubic feet of topsoil and 20 cubic feet of compost is within the gardener&rsquo;s budget.<br></p>
<p>E: \(1.89t+4.59c\leq70\)</p>
<p>F: If the line represents the equation \(1.89t+4.59c=70\), this graph represents the solutions to the gardener&rsquo;s budget constraint.<br></p><br>

<p><strong>Answer:The combination of 7.5 cubic feet of topsoil and 12 cubic feet of compost is within the gardener's budget., \(1.89t+4.59c&le;70\), If the line on the graph represents the equation \(1.89t+4.59c=70\), this graph represents the solutions to the gardener's budget constraint.  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>The combination of 7.5 cubic feet of topsoil and 12 cubic feet of compost is within the gardener's budget, since 7.5(1.89)+12(4.59)&lt;70.</li>
  <li>The inequality, \(1.89t+4.59c&leq;70\),since the price of topsoil is $1.89 times the number of cubic feet plus $4.59 per number of cubic feet of compost must be less than or equal to $70.</li>
  <li>If the line on the graph represents the equation \(1.89t+4.59c=70\) this graph represents the solutions to the gardener's budget constraint, since the area below the line is shaded meaning any combinations in that area would be less than $70.</li>
  </ul>
