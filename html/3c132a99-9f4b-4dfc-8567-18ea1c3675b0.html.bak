<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>Your teacher will give you a <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/963aa0f9dc29d4c50ae5f803f5fa5bbfd126c976" target="_blank">set of cards</a> that show scatter plots.</p>
<p>Arrange all the cards in three different ways. Ensure that you and your partner agree on each arrangement before moving on to the next one. Sort all the cards in order from:</p>
<ul>
<li>best to worst for representing with a linear model</li>
<li>least to greatest slope of a linear model that fits the data well</li>
<li>least to greatest vertical intercept of a linear model that fits the data well</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>Know that the <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">line of best fit</span> is the line that provides the best fit to the data. It should follow the trend of the data and go through the middle of the data with a similar number of points on each side of the line.</p>

<p>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. B, E, A, and F, C, D, and G. There may be some debate about the exact order. It is important that you recognize that B is the best fit, and that D and G should not be fit with linear models. You should be able to reason that linear models fit more poorly the farther the data are from the line.

<p class="os-raise-mb-0">Having purpose is showing a commitment to making a meaningful contribution to the world. Purpose drives you to make positive contributions in line with your own interests and strengths. </p>
<p>Think about your current sense of purpose. Are the following statements are true for you?</p>
<ul>
<li>
          I often reflect on my life goals and the kind of person I want to be.
        </li>
<li>
          I often think about what matters most to me and why it matters.
        </li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t worry if none of these statements are true for you. Developing this trait takes time. Your first step starts today!</p>
