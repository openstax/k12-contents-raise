<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>The purpose of this warm up is to elicit the idea that the values in the table have a predictable pattern, which will be useful when students consider the context of a falling object in a later activity. While students may notice and wonder many things about this table, the patterns are the important discussion points, rather than an attempt to find a rule for the function. Because the rule is not easy to uncover, studying the numbers ahead of time should prove helpful as students analyze the function later.</p>
<p>This prompt gives students opportunities to see and make use of structure. The specific structure they might notice is all the \(y\)-values are multiples of 16 and perfect squares. Some may notice the pattern is not linear and wonder whether it is quadratic.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Have students write down their thoughts about what they notice and wonder in the table. Then, have them turn and talk with a partner. Ask pairs to share their thoughts with the class and add to a growing list. If some of the sample answers are not present, then ask questions to facilitate their addition to the class list.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Study the table. What do you notice? What do you wonder?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Things you may notice:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The \(x\)-values increment by 1 as you move across the table. </li>
  <li> The \(y\)-values increase. </li>
  <li> All \(y\)-values are even and divisible by 4, 8, and 16. </li>
  <li> The \(y\)-values are all perfect squares. </li>
  <li> The successive differences between the \(y\)-values are growing. </li>
</ul>
<p>Things you may wonder:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Is there a rule for these numbers? </li>
  <li> Do the numbers represent the growth of a geometric pattern? </li>
  <li> Do the numbers represent a quadratic relationship? </li>
  <li> What is the next number in the table? </li>
</ul>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their observations and questions. Record and display them for all to see.</p>
<p>After all responses are recorded, tell students that they will investigate these values more closely in upcoming activities.</p>
