<h2>Lesson Structure</h2>
<p>A typical lesson in this course has five phases:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Warm Up </li>
  <li> Primary Learning Activities </li>
  <li> Cool Down </li>
  <li> Practice </li>
  <li> Lesson Synthesis </li>
</ul>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Warm Up </p>
<p>The first activity in every lesson is a Warm Up. This activity is usually an instructional routine that invites all students to engage in the mathematics of each lesson. The Warm Ups provide opportunities for students to bring their personal experiences as well as their mathematical knowledge to problems and discussions. They place value on students&rsquo; voices as they communicate their developing ideas, ask questions, justify their responses, and critique the reasoning of others.</p>
<p>A Warm Up either:</p>
<ul>
  <li> helps students get ready for the day&rsquo;s lesson, or </li>
  <li> gives students an opportunity to strengthen their number sense or procedural fluency </li>
</ul>
<p> A Warm Up that helps students get ready for today&rsquo;s lesson might serve to remind them of a context they have seen before, get them thinking about where the previous lesson left off, or preview a context or idea that will come up in the lesson so that it doesn't get in the way of learning new mathematics.</p>
<p>A Warm Up that is meant to strengthen number sense or procedural fluency asks students to do mental arithmetic or reason numerically or algebraically. It gives them a chance to make deeper connections or become more flexible in their thinking.</p>
<p>These activities serve the additional purpose of strengthening students&rsquo; skills in listening and speaking about mathematics. Warm ups should take 5–10 minutes.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, consider establishing a small, discreet hand signal students can display to indicate they have an answer they can support with reasoning. This signal could be a thumbs up, or students could show the number of fingers that indicates the number of responses they have for the problem. This is a quick way to see if students have had enough time to think about the problem and keep them from being distracted or rushed by classmates&rsquo; raised hands.</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Primary Learning Activities</p>
<p>After the Warm Up, lessons consist of a sequence of typically one to three instructional activities. The activities are the heart of the mathematical experience and make up the majority of the time spent in class.</p>
<p>An activity can serve one or more of many purposes.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Provide experience with a new context. </li>
  <li> Introduce a new concept and associated language. </li>
  <li> Introduce a new representation. </li>
  <li> Formalize a definition of a term for an idea previously encountered informally. </li>
  <li> Identify and resolve common mistakes and misconceptions that people make. </li>
  <li> Practice using mathematical language. </li>
  <li> Work toward mastery of a concept or procedure. </li>
  <li> Provide an opportunity to apply mathematics to a modeling or other application problem. </li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of each activity is described in its narrative.</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Cool Down</p>
<p>The Cool Down task is to be given to students at the end of the primary learning activities or at the end of the full lesson (after the Practice problems). Students are meant to work on the Cool Down for about 5 minutes independently and discuss it or turn in a written synthesis. The Cool Down serves as a brief formative assessment to determine whether students understood the lesson. Students&rsquo; responses to the Cool Down can be used to make adjustments to further instruction.</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Practice</p>
<p>Practice problems provide students with a no-risk opportunity to solidify the learning from the lesson. Students have multiple attempts to answer each question and receive feedback when they answer incorrectly. This feedback includes directions to the learning activity which would most likely help them successfully try the question again. There are approximately 10 questions in each set of practice problems. The practice problems may be completed before or after the Cool Down.</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Lesson Synthesis</p>
<p>After the activities for the day are done, students should take time to synthesize what they have learned. This portion of class should take 5–10 minutes. Each lesson includes a lesson synthesis that assists the teacher with ways to help students incorporate new insights gained during the activities into their big-picture understanding. Teachers can use this time in any number of ways, including posing questions verbally and calling on volunteers to respond, asking students to respond to prompts in a written journal, asking students to add on to a graphic organizer or concept map, or adding a new component to a persistent display like a word wall.</p>

  <!-- Header goes here -->Lesson Overview and Readiness Guide </button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Lesson Narrative</p>
    <p>Each lesson begins with a narrative of the mathematical work that will unfold within the activities of that lesson. Lesson narratives explain:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> the mathematical content of the lesson and its place in the learning sequence </li>
      <li> the meaning of any new terms introduced in the lesson </li>
      <li> how the mathematical practices come into play, as appropriate </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Learning Goals</p>
    <p>Teacher-facing learning goals appear at the top of the lesson overview. They describe, for a teacher audience, the mathematical, pedagogical, and language goals of the lesson.</p>
    <p>Student-facing learning goals appear in student materials at the beginning of each lesson and start with the word &quot;Let's.&quot; They are intended to invite students into the work of that day without giving away too much and spoiling the problem-based instruction. They are suitable for writing on the board before class begins.</p>
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Learning Targets</p>
    <p>These appear in student materials at the end of each unit. They describe, for a student audience, the mathematical goals of each lesson.</p>
    <p>We do not recommend writing learning targets on the board before class begins, because doing so might spoil the problem-based instruction. (The student-facing learning goals (that start with &quot;Let's&quot;) are more appropriate for this purpose.)</p>
    <p>Teachers and students might use learning targets in a number of ways. Some examples include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> targets for standards-based grading </li>
      <li> prompts for a written reflection as part of a lesson synthesis </li>
      <li> a study aid for self-assessment, review, or catching up after an absence from school </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</p>
    <p>A table listing all of the TEKS addressed in the lesson is provided along with an explanation of the depth of coverage.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Math process coverage -</strong> While all of the process standards should be used within the course of instruction for the lesson, specific ones have been highlighted since they will be the one(s) most prominently used.</li>
      <li><strong>Foundational -</strong> This type of coverage means the content in the lesson does not address the required rigor of the grade level TEKS but is necessary in providing access to the required expectation levels.</li>
      <li><strong>Partial -</strong> This type of coverage means one or more of the component break outs for the TEKS has been addressed, but not all parts.</li>
      <li><strong>Full -</strong> This type of coverage means all parts of the TEKS have been covered at the required level of rigor.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are a few activities within some lessons that have been identified as exceeding the expectations of the TEKS. Notification of which activities fall into this category has been placed in narrative for the activity. These activities may be used for extension and differentiation.</p>
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Lesson Activities</p>
    <p>A list of all of the primary learning activities for students is listed. The first and last instructional activity will be the Warm Up and Cool Down, respectively. Each learning activity denoted between the Warm Up and Cool Down will include a Self Check and Additional Resources.</p>
    <p>If an activity in the list lacks a Self Check or Additional Resources, it is typically an activity that exceeds the expectation of the TEKS and may be used as an extension or extension activity.</p>
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Required Materials and Preparation</p>
    <p>This section provides notification if special materials are required for any of the activities in the lesson. Such materials might include card sorts, graphic organizers, manipulatives, technology, etc.</p>
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Lesson Vocabulary</p>
    <p>A list of the vocabulary words students are expected to learn and be able to use during the lesson are provided. The terms are divided between vocabulary that is new to the students and terms they should have learned in previous instruction.</p>
    <p>Sample word wall cards are provided for use during discussions and activities. Model referencing the terms during instruction and encourage students to do so also.</p>
    <p>To support newcomers or students identified at the beginning level of language proficiency, links to digital vocabulary cards in both English and Spanish have been provided. It is suggested to use the Spanish versions to anchor student understanding before bridging to the English versions.</p>
    <p>The links have not been provided to students so that teachers may provide the appropriate set according to an individual student’s linguistic needs.</p>
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Support for English Language Learners</p>
    <p>The list provided on the Teacher Overview for each lesson is not exhaustive, but it contains the ELPS that are most applicable for the activities in the lesson. Every lesson has been designed to provide ELPS instruction in at least three of the domains: speaking, listening, reading, writing, and thinking. The list of the targeted domains and standards for the lesson are in this list.</p>
    <p>Directions for how to meet these standards involve the use of specific Math Language Routines [MLR] and have been provided within the Teacher Guides of each activity.</p>
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Support for Building Character</p>
    <p>Each unit of instruction provides instructional suggestions and resources teachers may use to develop students’ workplace tools and learner behaviors. The Building Character activities at the lesson level include targeted tips teachers may use with or provide to students.</p>
    <p>For instance, the Building Charter focus in Unit 1 is Social Intelligence. This topic will feed into developing students’ awareness of how to interact in cooperative learning environments, a key learner behavior students need to learn early in the year.</p>

<!-- Accordion Item #2-->

<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> 
  <!-- Header goes here --> Learning Activities Guides </button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>Each instructional activity (Warm Up, Primary Learning Activities, Cool Down, Practice) has a learning guide with suggestions for how to implement the content. The activities typically have three phases: Launch, Activity Work Time, and Activity Synthesis.</p>
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Activity Narrative</p>
    <p>The Activity Narratives begin each page and include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> the mathematical purpose of the activity and its place in the learning sequence </li>
      <li> what students are doing during the activity </li>
      <li> what the teacher needs to look for while students are working on an activity to orchestrate an effective synthesis </li>
      <li> connections to the mathematical process standards, when appropriate </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Launch</p>
    <p>During the launch, the teacher makes sure that students understand the context (if there is one) and what the problem is asking them to do. This is not the same as making sure the students know how to do the problem—part of the work that students should be doing for themselves is figuring out how to solve the problem. The launch invites students into the lesson and helps them connect to contexts that may be unfamiliar.</p>
    <p>The launch for an activity also includes suggestions for grouping students.</p>
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Student Activity and Answers</p>
    <p>Student Activities may follow a brief teacher mini-lesson or be used as the instructional portion of the lesson. This is a time when students have an opportunity to work individually, with a partner, or in small groups depending on the purpose of the activity.</p>
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Activity Synthesis</p>
    <p>During the activity synthesis, the teacher orchestrates some time for students to synthesize what they have learned. This time is used to ensure that all students have an opportunity to understand the mathematics of the activity and situate the new learning within students’ previous understanding.</p>
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Differentiation Supports</p>
    <p>Every lesson contains suggestions for how to meet the various needs of learners. More detailed descriptions of the specific supports and design principles are provided for teachers in the Supporting All Learners section of the course. The available supports listed in the Lesson Teacher Guides include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong> Support for English Language Learners</strong> This support aims to provide guidance to help teachers recognize and support students' language development in the context of mathematical sense-making. Embedded within the curriculum are instructional routines and practices to help teachers address the specialized academic language demands in math when planning and delivering lessons. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><strong> Support for Students with Disabilities</strong> Each lesson support is carefully designed to maximize engagement and accessibility for all students. These supports empower students and capitalize on their existing strengths and abilities so they can participate meaningfully in rigorous mathematical content. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><strong> Are You Ready For More? </strong>Most primary learning activities include an opportunity for differentiation for students ready for more of a challenge. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Every extension problem is made available to all students with the heading &quot;Are You Ready for More?&quot; These problems go deeper into grade-level mathematics and often make connections between the topic at hand and other concepts. Some of these problems extend the work of the associated activity, but some of them involve work from prior grades, prior units in the course, or reflect work that is related to the K–12 curriculum but a type of problem not required by the standards. They are not routine or procedural, and they are not just &quot;the same thing again but with harder numbers.&quot;</p>
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Self Check Problems</p>
    <p>Self Check items assess understanding of the specific TEKS breakout expectation that was addressed in the Activity and consist of only one question. Thus, they rarely assess the full rigor expectation of the TEKS, but fully assess the breakout objective of the TEKS from the primary lesson Activity. If students incorrectly answer the question, they are automatically moved into a set of Additional Resources that can be used to refresh student understanding. Thus, these questions are always multiple choice including the option for “I am not sure.”</p>
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Additional Resources</p>
    <p>Access to the Additional Resources is provided automatically to students who incorrectly answer the Self Check question. Students who answer the question correctly may access the Additional Resources content by using the right-navigation Lesson Menu.</p>
    <p>The content on the Additional Resources page consists of two sections. First, students have access to a set of explanations or examples that was the basis of the content in the activity. Then, in the Try It section, students have an opportunity to complete a question based on the examples they just read or similar to the Self Check question.</p>
    <p>There are several options for how teachers can use the information on the Additional Resources page.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> The content may be used as a remediation review component for the activity. If students reach this page after incorrectly answering the Self Check question, they have the opportunity to retry the Self Check question or move onto the next learning activity when they have completed reading the Additional Resources page and completing the Try It question. </li>
      <li> Students may also be directed to this page if the teacher chooses to use it for direct instruction prior to the activity. </li>
      <li> And, finally, teachers may choose to use the Additional Resources page as an outline for building a mini-lesson that can be used prior to the activity or within a small group instructional setting. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Anticipated Misconceptions</p>
    <p>Recommendations for potential areas of misunderstanding and how to address them are provided for lessons where appropriate.</p>
    <p>Suggestions include prompts and guidance to support the teacher in modeling, explaining, and communicating the concept(s).</p>
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Videos</p>
    <p>Videos that explain the thinking and procedures needed for specific problems within the content are provided for students to access as needed.</p>
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Response to Student Thinking</p>
    <p>The Response to Student Thinking on the Teacher Guides for the Cool Down provides guidance on how teachers might make adjustments based on specific student responses to a Cool Down. Next day supports, such as providing students access to specific manipulatives or having students discuss their reasoning with a partner, are recommended for Cool Down responses that should be addressed while continuing on to the next lesson. Teachers are directed to appropriate prior grade level support for Cool Down responses that may need more attention.</p>
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Practice Problems</p>
    <p>Each section in a unit includes an associated set of practice problems. Teachers may decide to assign practice problems for homework or for extra practice in class. It is up to teachers to decide which problems to assign (including assigning none at all).</p>
    <p class="os-raise-text-bold">Lesson Synthesis</p>
    <p>The Teacher Guide for the Lesson Synthesis portion contains questions and activities teachers can use to solidify student understanding for the full lesson. Sample answers are provided for teachers.</p>

<h4>Accessing Rigor</h4>
<p>This course includes a variety of questions and tasks that provide instruction and assessment at increasing levels of rigor and complexity. The targeted level of depth of understanding is defined by the rigor expectation of the TEKS for the activity, lesson, or unit.</p>
<br>
<!-- Accordion Item #3-->
<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> Increasing Rigor within Activities</button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>Lesson activities pose questions to students so that one response leads to another. A lesson may begin by appealing to student interest or sparking their curiosity, then, the questions build in complexity and rigor as students receive feedback about their responses.</p>
    <p>This Warm Up example from one of the first lessons in the course, illustrates this design.</p>
    <p><img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/6b2281c4b1cd53720f27bf08a8e0e2a8c484cca6" width="520"/></p>
    <p>The level of questioning grows from requiring students to explain the meaning of a one-variable equation to the meaning of a multivariable equation to creating their own equation and describing its meaning. In this way, students experience questioning at increasing levels of rigor.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<!-- Accordion End-->

<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> Increasing Rigor within Lessons </button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>The course continues to increase the levels of rigor as students move from one activity to another within the lessons.</p>
    <p>In the activities that follow the Warm Up example provided earlier, students begin to apply more abstract, academic vocabulary to their learning and consider the reasonableness of their responses.</p>
    <p><img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/2b22d029966c86ff0881476176f0faf8c576768e" width="520"/></p>
    <p>As the lesson continues, students move towards applying their ability to write equations in differing situations and scenarios.</p>
    <p>This example from the Practice problems for this lesson show how expectations are beginning to approach the TEKS expectation to &ldquo;write linear equations in two variables given a table of values, a graph, and a verbal description.&rdquo; (Algebra 2(C))</p>
    <p><img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/fe3d0812faf19ed61aa982ff3ff6be119960ea22" width="520"/></p>

  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> Increasing Rigor within Units</button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    
    <p>The previous examples are from the first activities and lesson of the unit where student development has not yet achieved the full rigor of the TEKS. That lesson is the first step in the learning progression for the whole unit. Ultimately, students acquire the rigor of the TEKS after completion of all the lessons within the unit.</p>
    <p>The next example, from the middle portion of the unit, shows students writing equations for more complex scenarios and also determining values for varying situations.</p>
    <p><img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/623dee0057773f4d8352e9533076e42e7fcd3b9d" width="520"/></p>
    <p>Notice that students are now meeting one portion of the TEKS expectation. They are now able to write linear equations in two variables given a verbal description.</p>
    <p>In one of the lessons towards the end of the unit, students are asked to find information from tables, equations, and graphs. This information will then be used to write linear equations in two variables.</p>
    <p><img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/5ddca10822f6e79a9e94521e6c1f219a09ee7880" width="520"/></p>
    <p>Not only does this example illustrate the increase in rigor aligned to the TEKS, but it reinforces another point. As mentioned in a previous section about the developing rigor within the activities, note how the questions begin by asking students scaffolded questions about slope and y-intercept, information needed to write a linear equation.</p>
    <p>The unit concludes with a Unit Quiz and Project. Both of these assessments are designed to assess the full rigor of the TEKS. Recall that Algebra 2(C) expects students to be able to write linear equations in two variables given a table of values, a graph, and a verbal description.</p>
    <p>This first sample from the Unit Quiz illustrates mastery of writing a linear equation in two variables given a verbal description.</p>
    <p><img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/761dfd04869df903b256ed90c9a3af92c06098cf" width="520"/></p>
    <p>In the second portion of the Unit 1 Project, students are provided with images of graphs. Then, with a partner, they determine key features of each graph such as slope and y-intercept, use the information to write an equation for the line, and finally create a real world scenario that could be represented by the graph.</p>
    <p><img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/086a521b1292bcca1832266b5d59dff6c0d625f9" width="520"/></p>
    <p>Other questions in the quizzes and practice problems provide students with tables and ask them to write equations.</p>
    <p>Over the course of the unit, students fulfill the rigor expectations of all parts of the TEKS A.2(C). They begin the learning progression by answering questions about a topic that might hold interest to them, ordering and planning a pizza party, and writing expressions and equations about the constraints in that scenario. Then, they apply the ability to write linear equations to other situations and more specifically to situations involving two variables when data is provided through graphs, tables of values, and verbal descriptions.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<!-- Accordion End--> 
<br>
<p>Thus, this course meets the rigor expectations for each TEKS in a manner that invites students to use their personal experiences and background knowledge to access the content. It accomplishes this progression at the activity, lesson, and unit levels.</p>
<h4>Addressing Conceptual Understanding and Procedural Fluency in the Lessons</h4>
<p>This course seeks to support student development of conceptual understanding because students need to understand the &ldquo;why&rdquo; behind the &ldquo;how&rdquo; in mathematics. Concepts build on experience with concrete contexts. Students should access these concepts from a number of perspectives in order to see math as more than a set of disconnected procedures.</p>
<p>In this course, procedural fluency is viewed as solving problems expected by the standards with speed, accuracy, and flexibility. While strategic competence implies applying mathematical or statistical concepts and skills to a novel mathematical or real-world context.</p>
<p>These three aspects of mathematical proficiency are interconnected: procedural fluency is supported by conceptual understanding, and deep understanding often requires procedural fluency. In order to be successful in applying mathematics (strategic competence), students must both understand and be able to do the mathematics.</p>
<p>For more extensive information about mathematical proficiency in this course, access the Unit Sequence and Resources in the Course Design of the Appendix.</p>
<h4>Instructional Strategies</h4>
<p>The kind of instruction appropriate in any particular lesson depends on the learning goals of that lesson. Some lessons may be devoted to developing a concept, others to mastering a procedural skill, yet others to applying mathematics to a real-world problem. These aspects of mathematical proficiency are interwoven. These materials include a small set of activity structures and reference a small, high-leverage set of teacher moves that become more and more familiar to teachers and students as the year progresses.</p>

    <p>The first instance of each routine in a course includes more detailed guidance for how to successfully conduct the routine. Subsequent instances include more abbreviated guidance, so as not to unnecessarily inflate the word count of the teacher guide.</p>
    <p>Activities using the routines are flagged for the teacher, which is helpful for lesson planning and for focusing the work of professional development.</p>
    <p>Some of the instructional routines, known as Mathematical Language Routines (MLR), were developed by the Stanford University UL/SCALE team. The purpose of each MLR is described in the Supporting All Learners section of the course.</p>

      <li> <strong>Provide experience with a new context.</strong> Activities that give all students experience with a new context ensure that students are ready to make sense of the concrete before encountering the abstract. </li>
      <li><strong> Introduce a new concept and associated language. </strong>Activities that introduce a new concept and associated language build on what students already know and ask them to notice or put words to something new. </li>
      <li><strong> Introduce a new representation. </strong>Activities that introduce a new representation often present the new representation of a familiar idea first and ask students to interpret it. Where appropriate, new representations are connected to familiar representations or extended from familiar representations. Students are then given clear instructions on how to create such a representation as a tool for understanding or for solving problems. For subsequent activities and lessons, students are given opportunities to practice using these representations and to choose which representation to use for a particular problem. </li>
      <li><strong> Formalize a definition of a term for an idea previously encountered informally.</strong> Activities that formalize a definition take a concept that students have already encountered through examples, and give it a more general definition. </li>
      <li><strong> Identify and resolve common mistakes and misconceptions that people make.</strong> Activities that give students a chance to identify and resolve common mistakes and misconceptions usually present some incorrect work and ask students to identify it as such and explain what is incorrect about it. Students deepen their understanding of key mathematical concepts as they analyze and critique the reasoning of others. </li>
      <li><strong> Practice using mathematical language.</strong> Activities that provide an opportunity to practice using mathematical language are focused on that as the primary goal rather than having a primarily mathematical learning goal. They are intended to give students a reason to use mathematical language to communicate. These frequently use the Info Gap instructional routine. </li>
      <li><strong> Work toward mastery of a concept or procedure.</strong> Activities where students work toward mastery are included for topics where experience shows students often need some additional time to work with the ideas. Often these activities are marked as optional because no new mathematics is covered, so if a teacher were to skip them, no new topics would be missed. </li>
      <li> <strong>Provide an opportunity to apply mathematics to a modeling or other application problem.</strong> Activities that provide an opportunity to apply mathematics to a modeling or other application problem are most often found toward the end of a unit. Their purpose is to give students experience using mathematics to reason about a problem or situation that one might encounter naturally outside of a mathematics classroom. </li>
