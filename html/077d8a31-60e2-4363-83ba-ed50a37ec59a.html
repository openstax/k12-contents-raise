<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tell which quantities in a situation can vary and which ones cannot.</li>
  <li>Explain the meaning of the term &ldquo;constraint.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Use letters and numbers to write expressions representing the quantities in a situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1.1.1: Understanding Value&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you wrote equations to solve problems about a meal. The big thing you learned is that an equation is a statement that an expression has the same value as another expression. An equation can have letters, numbers, or a mix of letters and numbers.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1.1.2: Creating Expressions to Estimate Cost, Part 1<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you learned how expressions could represent the quantities in a situation like planning a pizza party. You also saw how expressions could change if quantities changed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1.1.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>
  <li>1.1.2: Additional Resources&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<li>1.1.3: Understanding Constraints<ul>
    <li>In this activity, you continued working with the pizza party and learned that a constraint is something that limits what is possible or reasonable in a situation.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>1.1.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>
<li>1.1.3: Additional Resources&nbsp;</li>

<li>1.1.4: Creating Expressions to Estimate Cost, Part 2<ul>
    <li>In this activity, you wrote expressions and examined constraints for the cost of an ice cream party for the ninth-grade class.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice:</strong><br></p>
