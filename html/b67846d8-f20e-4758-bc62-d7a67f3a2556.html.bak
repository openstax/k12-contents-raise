<p>Functions \(R\) and \(D\) give the height, in feet, of a toy rocket and a drone, \(t\) seconds after they are released. Here are the graphs of \(R\) (for the rocket) and \(D\) (for the drone).</p>
<p><img alt="A graph shows height in feet vs. time in seconds. Two curves, D (a flat-topped shape) and R (a parabola), both rise, but R peaks near 2 seconds and descends, while D stays flat from 2 to 5 seconds, then drops." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/6953fee5f8d02223583c335e6d1949b8e372de5f"/></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>Which of the inequalities is true: \(R(2)&gt;D(2)\) or \(D(2)&gt; R(2)\)?</li>
<p> <strong>Answer: </strong> \(R(2)&gt;D(2)\)</p>
<li>What was the height of the drone when the toy rocket hit the ground?</li>
<p> <strong>Answer: </strong> 20 feet</p>
<li>For what value of \(t\) is \(R(t)=D(t)\) true?</li>
<p> <strong>Answer: </strong> About \(t=4.5\).</p>
<li>What does this tell you about the drone and the toy rocket?</li>
<p> <strong>Answer: </strong> At 4.5 seconds, the toy rocket and the drone are at the same height.</p>
