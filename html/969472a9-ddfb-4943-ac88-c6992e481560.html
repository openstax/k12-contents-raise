<p>To help students&rsquo; understanding of key points from the lesson, discuss the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li> &ldquo;Why are the properties of exponents important when multiplying polynomials?&rdquo; (When multiplying polynomials, terms of different degrees are often multiplied together. The properties of exponents determine how this process goes.) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;How is the Distributive Property used to multiply polynomials?&rdquo; (Each term in one polynomial is distributed through a second polynomial using multiplication. Like terms are combined to simplify the product.) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;How is Vertical Alignment used to multiply polynomials?&rdquo; (Polynomials are written vertically in a traditional multiplication format. The individual products from the multiplication of each term are added together to find the final product.) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;How is the FOIL method used to multiply polynomials?&rdquo; (The FOIL method is specifically used to multiply two binomials. A four-step process is used, first-outside-inside-last, to ensure that each term is multiplied together. Like terms are combined to simplify the product.) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;How is recognizing binomial squares and conjugate pairs helpful in polynomial multiplication?&rdquo; (These two situations represent special cases of binomial multiplication in which the products fit very particular patterns. This helps us take a small shortcut in finding and organizing the final product of these binomials.) </li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
