<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Give examples of a sequence. </li>
<li> Explain the meaning of the term &ldquo;sequence.&rdquo; </li>
<li> Explain the meaning of the term &ldquo;term,&rdquo; as it is used in a mathematical sequence. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the<strong> activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li> 4.13.1: Describe the Pattern </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you were given a rule and then made up a list of numbers using that rule. </li>
</ul>
<li> 4.13.2: What Is a Sequence? </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you explored the Tower of Hanoi puzzle and started to make sense of the patterns to solve the puzzle, depending on how many discs there were and how many moves were needed. </li>
</ul>
<li> 4.13.2: Self Check </li>
<li> 4.13.3: The Connection Between Sequences and Terms </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you explored a game with checkers and worked to find a pattern with the number of checkers on each side and the number of moves needed to complete the game. </li>
</ul>
<li> 4.13.3: Self Check </li>
<li> 4.13.4: Rules for a Sequence </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you gave a rule for a sequence and listed 3 terms. You then thought of another rule for the sequence and gave a different list of the next 3 terms. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li> 4.13.5: Practice </li>
