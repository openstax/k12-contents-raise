<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In an earlier lesson, students reasoned about visual patterns using different representations and wrote expressions
  to describe the patterns. In this lesson, they continue to work with patterns but begin to see these relationships as
  quadratic functions and write equations to define them.</p>
<p>Students recognize that different expressions can be used to describe the same function. Previously, they learned
  that an expression like \(n^2+2n\) is a quadratic expression. Here they see that \(n(n+2)\) defines the same function
  as \(n^2+2n\), so \(n(n+2)\) is also a quadratic expression. The work here is a preview to a more formal exploration
  of equivalent expressions later.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Comprehend that the same quadratic function can be expressed symbolically in different ways. </li>
  <li> Interpret (using words and other representations) the quadratic relationships in growing patterns as functions,
    where each input gives a particular output. </li>
  <li> Write expressions that define quadratic functions. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Recognize quadratic functions written in different ways. </li>
  <li> Use information from a pattern of shapes to write a quadratic function. </li>
  <li> Know that, in a pattern of shapes, the step number is the input and the number of squares is the output. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are
  only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.
  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines. </p>
<ul>
  <li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and
    reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
  <li>A3(B) expand and internalize initial English vocabulary by learning and using high-frequency English words
    necessary for identifying and describing people, places, and objects, by retelling simple stories and basic
    information represented or supported by pictures, and by learning and using routine language needed for classroom
    communication</li>
  <li>A3(D) speak using grade-level content area vocabulary in context to internalize new English words and build
    academic language proficiency</li>
  <li>A3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions</li>
  <li>A3(F) ask and give information ranging from using a very limited bank of high-frequency, high-need, concrete
    vocabulary, including key words and expressions needed for basic communication in academic and social contexts, to
    using abstract and content-based vocabulary during extended speaking assignments</li>
  <li>A4(D) use prereading supports such as graphic organizers, illustrations, and pretaught topic-related vocabulary
    and other prereading activities to enhance comprehension of written text</li>
  <li>A5(B) write using newly acquired basic vocabulary and content-based grade-level vocabulary</li>
</ul>
