<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>This lesson invites students to explore polynomial division. Using the Quotient Property for exponents, students will first learn to divide monomials by monomials, as well as larger polynomials by monomials. They will use long division to divide different polynomials by binomials. Students will learn an efficient method to divide a polynomial by a binomial of the form \(x - c\) called synthetic division. Students will divide polynomial functions using the skills they have learned in the lesson. They will learn the Remainder Theorem and Factor Theorem, which they can use to check their work while dividing polynomials.</p>
