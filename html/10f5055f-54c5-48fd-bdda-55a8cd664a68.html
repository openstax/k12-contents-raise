<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>This lesson invites students to explore polynomial division. Using the Quotient Property for exponents, students will first learn to divide monomials by monomials, as well as larger polynomials by monomials. They will use long division to divide different polynomials by binomials. Students will learn an efficient method to divide a polynomial by a binomial of the form \(x - c\) called synthetic division. Students will divide polynomial functions using the skills they have learned in the lesson. They will learn the Remainder Theorem and Factor Theorem, which they can use to check their work while dividing polynomials.</p>

<h4> Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<div>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS.  The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.<br>&nbsp;<br>
	<ul>
	 <li> A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
	  <li>A3(D) speak using grade-level content area vocabulary in context to internalize new English words and build academic language proficiency</li>
	  <li>A3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions</li>
	</ul>
