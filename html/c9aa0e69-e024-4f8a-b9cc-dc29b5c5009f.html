<h4>Activity P8.2: Converting Between Factored Form and Standard Form</h4>
<p>You have learned strategies for writing a quadratic expression in its factored form and standard form. In each round of this activity, you and your partner will be given equivalent quadratic expressions in different forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal of each round is to write the quadratic expression as it has been given to your partner. If your expression is in factored form, write it in standard form. If your expression is in standard form, write it in factored form. At the end of each round, compare the expressions with your partner without revealing the expressions for future rounds.</p>
<p>If, in any round, you need help, you may ask your partner to explain the next step without revealing the solution.</p>
<p>Proceed from rounds 1 to 6 while discussing your thinking if there is any disagreement.</p>

<h4>Activity P8.3: Modeling Rocket Flight Using a Quadratic Equation</h4>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li>Since the rocket left the ground at 1 second after Alejandra lit the fuse and it landed again 6 seconds after, we know the zeros of the quadratic equation are 1 and 6.</li>
</ol>
<p>This means the factored form of the quadratic equation modeling the flight of the rocket is \(f(x) =(x-1)(x-6)\).</p>
<p>We also know that at 5 seconds after Alejandra lit the fuse, the rocket was at a height of 8 meters. This means the quadratic equation we are looking for passes through the point \((5, 8)\).</p>
<p>We can use the intercept form of the quadratic equation to find the standard form we want.</p>
<p>We know the intercept form of a quadratic equation is \(f(x) = a(x ‚àí p)(x ‚àí q)\).</p>
<p>To find the value of \(a\), we can substitute the zeros for \(p\) and \(q\). We can also substitute 5 for \(x\) and 8 for \(f(x)\).</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}f(x)\;&amp;=&amp;\;a(x\;-\;p)(x\;-\;q)\\f(x)\;&amp;=&amp;\;a(x\;-\;1)(x\;-\;6)\\8&amp;=&amp;\;a((5)\;-\;1)((5)\;-\;6)\\8&amp;=&amp;\;a(4)(-1)\\8&amp;=&amp;\;-4a\\-2&amp;=&amp;\;a\\&amp;&amp;\end{array}\)</p>
<p>We can now substitute -2 back into the equation in intercept form for \(a\). Again, we can substitute the zeros for \(p\) and \(q\).</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}f(x)\;&amp;=&amp;\;a(x\;-\;p)(x\;-\;q)\\f(x)\;&amp;=&amp;\;-2(x\;-\;1)(x\;-\;6)\\f(x)\;&amp;=&amp;\;-2(x^2-7x+6)\\f(x)\;&amp;=&amp;\;-2x^2+14x-12\\&amp;&amp;\end{array}\)</p>
<p>So, the quadratic equation in standard form that models the flight of the rocket is \(f(x) = -2x^2+14x-12\).</p>
<ol start="2" class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li>To find the height of the rocket 3 seconds after Alejandra lit the fuse, we substitute 3 for \(x\) in the equation we just found.</li>
</ol>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}f(x)&amp;=&amp;-2x^2+14x-12\\f(x)&amp;=&amp;-2(3)^2+14(3)-12\\f(x)\;&amp;=&amp;\;-2(9)+42-12\\f(x)\;&amp;=&amp;\;-18+42-12\\f(x)\;&amp;=&amp;\;12\end{array}\)</p>
<p>The rocket was at 12 meters exactly 3 seconds after Alejandra lit the fuse.</p>
