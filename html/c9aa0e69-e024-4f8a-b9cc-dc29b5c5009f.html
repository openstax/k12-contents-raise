<h3>Narrative</h3>
<p>In this culminating project, you will use your knowledge of quadratic equations in different forms to solve problems.
</p>
<p>In the first activity, you will be given a graph of a quadratic function and asked to write the function in factored form. Next, you will determine how many solutions a function has based on an understanding of its factored form. You will also be asked to explain the characteristics of the graph of a quadratic function with no solution.
</p>
<p>In the second activity, you will work in pairs to rewrite quadratic expressions in factored and standard form using the strategies learned in the unit.
</p>
<p>Finally, in the third activity, you will find the specific equation in standard form of a quadratic function that has certain zeros and passes through a particular point, given a real-world situation. Then, you will use the equation to make a prediction about the situation, given the context of the problem.
</p>
<h3>Learning Targets</h3> 
<p>When you finish this project, you will have demonstrated how to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explain why quadratic equations can have no solutions and explain why there are none.
  </li>
  <li>Recognize quadratic equations that have zero, one, or two solutions when they are written in factored form.
  </li>
  <li>Write equivalent expressions in factored form when given quadratic expressions of the form ax2 + bx + c and ùëé is not 1.
  </li>
  <li>Use the intercept form of a quadratic function to define a specific function given its zeros and a point.
  </li>
</ul>
