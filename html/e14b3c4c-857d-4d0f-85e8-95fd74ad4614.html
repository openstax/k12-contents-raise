<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this partner activity, students take turns matching a sequence to a definition. As students trade roles explaining their thinking and listening, they have opportunities to explain their reasoning and critique the reasoning of others.</p>
<p>One sequence and one definition do not have matches. Students are tasked with writing the corresponding match.</p>
<p>Monitor for students using clear reasoning as they create a recursive definition for the sequence 18, 20, 22, 24 to share during the discussion.</p>
<p>Making a spreadsheet available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Tell students that for each sequence, one partner finds its matching recursive definition and explains why they think it matches. The partner&rsquo;s job is to listen and make sure they agree. If they don&rsquo;t agree, the partners discuss until they come to an agreement. For the next sequence, the students swap roles. If necessary, demonstrate this protocol before students start working.</p>
<p>Ensure that students notice that one sequence and one definition do not have matches, and they are tasked with writing the corresponding match for each.</p>

<p>Desmos activities are different from the graphing calculator application because they lead students through one or more interactive tasks. As students progress through the activity, teachers may use the Teacher Dashboard to monitor student responses and use them for whole group discussion. Activities may also be set to identify student responses that are correct or incorrect. </p>

<h5> Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<div>
  <p>Use this routine to support small-group discussion as students should take turns finding a match. Display the following sentence frames for all to see: &ldquo;Sequence _____ and definition _____ match because . . .&rdquo; and &ldquo;I noticed _____, so I matched . . .&rdquo; Encourage students to challenge each other when they disagree, and to press for precise mathematical language. This will help students clarify their reasoning about each match.</p>
</div>
<br>
<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>
<div>
  <p> Leverage choice around perceived challenge. Invite groups of students to find matches for at least 4 of the sequences. Chunking this task into more manageable parts may also support students who benefit from additional processing time.</p>
</div>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Start with the recursive definition: \(R(n)=3R(n-1) + 1\), \(n\geq2\) and given \(R(1)=-1\). See the table below for how to substitute to find more terms in the sequence using the recursive definition. Substitute the term number, \(n\), in for \(n\) in the recursive definition. Complete the table with a partner.</p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may not be sure how to begin matching terms in a sequence to a definition. Encourage them to start by picking a definition and calculating the first few terms of the sequence it represents.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Once all groups have completed the matching, ask: &ldquo;How did you decide which definitions to match to sequence 3, 6, 12, 24 and sequence 18, 36, 72, 144 when they both involve doubling?&rdquo; (They are both geometric with a growth factor of 2, but since they have different first terms you can use those to match the sequences to M and L.)</p>
<p>Next, invite previously identified students to share the recursive definition they created for sequence 18, 20, 22, 24 and their strategy for writing it.</p>
<p>If time allows and students need extra practice graphing functions, assign students one function each from the task statement to sketch a graph for. After work time, select students to share their sketches, displaying them for all to see and compare.</p>

<h3>4.16.2: Additional Resources</h3>
<p><strong><em>The following content is available to students who would like more support based on their experience with the self check. Students will not automatically have access to this content, so you may wish to share it with those who could benefit from it.</em></strong></p>
<h4>Writing Recursive Definitions</h4>
<p>Sometimes we can define a sequence recursively. That is, we can describe how to calculate the next term in a sequence if we know the previous term.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a sequence: 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, . . . This is an arithmetic sequence, where each term is 4 more than the previous term. Since sequences are functions, let&rsquo;s call this sequence \(f\). Then we can use function notation to write \(f(n)=f(n-1)+4\). Here, \(f(n)\) is the term, \(f(n-1)\) is the previous term, and + 4 represents the common difference since f is an arithmetic sequence.</p>
<p>When we define a function recursively, we must also say what the first term is. Without that, there would be no way of knowing if the sequence defined by \(f(n)=f(n-1)+4\) started with 6 or 81 or any other number. Here, one possible initial condition is \(f(1)=6\). It could also make sense to number the terms starting with 0, using \(f(0)=6\).</p>
<p>Combining this information gives the recursive definition: \(f(1)=6\) and \(f(n)=f(n-1)+4\) for \(n\geq2\), where \(n\) is an integer. We include the \(n\geq2\) at the end since the value of \(f\) at 1 is already given, and the other terms in the sequence are generated by inputting integers larger than 1 into the definition.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some examples from the first activity and write the recursive definition for each type of sequence:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>
    A: 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, . . .
    <br>
    <br>
    Arithmetic<br>
    <br>
    \(A(1)=30, A(n)=A(n-1)+10, n\geq2\)
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>
    B: 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 2.5, . . .
    <br>
    <br>
    Geometric<br>
    <br>
    \(B(1)=80, B(n)=B(n-1) \frac12, n\geq2\)
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>
    F: 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, . . .
    <br>
    <br>
    Neither<br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Try It: Writing Recursive Definitions</h4>
<p>Write \(E(1)\) and a recursive definition for \(E(n)\):</p>
<p>E: 20, 13, 6, &ndash;1, &ndash;8, . . .</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5> Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to write the recursive definition for this sequence:</p>
<p>\(E(1)=20\), then each term after is formed by subtracting 7, so \(E(n)=E(n-1)-7\), \(n\geq2\)</p>
