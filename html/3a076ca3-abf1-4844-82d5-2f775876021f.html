<h4>Graphing Situations as Functions</h4>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Draw a graph representing a function that describes Sam&rsquo;s distance from home over an hour.</p>
<p>A: Sam rides his bike to his friend&rsquo;s house at a constant rate for 20 minutes.<br>
  B: Sam plays for 20 minutes at his friend&rsquo;s house.<br>
  C: Sam and his friend bike together to an ice cream shop that is between their houses for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Here is a sample graph. Notice that the \(x\)-axis is labeled &ldquo;time in minutes&rdquo; and the \(y\)-axis is labeled &ldquo;distance from home (miles).&rdquo;</p>
<p>The distance from home is increasing as Sam rides to his friend&rsquo;s house. While playing at his friend&rsquo;s house, the distance remained constant and unchanged. When Sam left his friend&rsquo;s house for the ice cream shop, the distance from home decreased because the shop is in between their houses, so Sam was getting closer to home.</p>
<p><img alt="GRAPH THAT SHOWS DISTANCE FROM HOME IN MILES AS A FUNCTION OF TIME IN MINUTES. X-AXIS GOES FROM 0 TO 60 IN INCREMENTS OF 10. Y-AXIS GOES FROM 0 TO 3.5 IN INCREMENTS OF 0.5. THE GRAPH INCREASES LINEARLY FROM X = 0 TO X = 20, REACHING A DISTANCE OF 3.25 MILES (SECTION A), REMAINS CONSTANT FROM X = 20 TO X = 40 (SECTION B), AND THEN DECREASES (SECTION C)." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="286" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/270cc818f622d4b3644527d27a8807e4e94fcbbf" width="300"></p>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<p>Tyler filled up his bathtub, took a bath, and then drained the tub. The function gives the depth of the water \(B\), in inches, \(t\) minutes after Tyler began to fill the bathtub.</p>
<p><img alt="Blank coordinate plane, no grid, origin O. Horizontal axis, time, minutes, from 0 to 40 by 10&rsquo;s. Vertical axis, depth, inches, from 0 to 15 by 5&rsquo;s." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="228" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/0da028a19bba61dc0287d112e3f1bcaa82e751ed" width="307"></p>
<p>These statements describe how the water level in the tub was changing over time. Use the statements to sketch an approximate graph of the function.</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(B(0) = 0\)</li>
  <li>\(B(1) &lt; B(7)\)</li>
  <li>\(B(9) = 11\)</li>
  <li>\(B(10) = B(20)\)</li>
  <li>\(B(20) &gt; B(40)\)</li>
</ul>
<p>A sample graph below meets all of the statements above.</p>

<h4>Try It: Graphing Situations as Functions</h4>
<p>A rock climber begins her descent from a height of 50 feet. She slowly descends at a constant rate for 4 minutes. She takes a break for 1 minute; she then realizes she left some of her gear on top of the rock and climbs more quickly back to the top at a constant rate.</p>
