<p>When the quadratic paths of pumpkins in the Punkin Chunkin are graphed, their functions can be written in different but equivalent forms that make it easier to identify the intercepts of the graph.</p>
<p>Quadratic functions can be written in different ways, including standard and factored form. In this section, you will write quadratic expressions in both forms and use both forms to identify key characteristics of quadratic graphs such as \(x\)- and \(y\)-intercepts.</p>
<p>This section includes three lessons:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Equivalent Quadratic Expressions </li>
  <li> Standard Form and Factored Form </li>
  <li> Graphs of Functions in Standard and Factored Forms </li>
</ul>
