<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>In preparation for the activity, review the properties of equality. When the same operation is performed with the same number to both sides of an equation, the equation remains true. This will be used as a base to build upon for operations performed on an inequality.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>In this activity, we’re going to solve inequalities. Work with a partner to solve each inequality given. Then match it with the number line representing its solution.</p>
<p>As you complete the activity, discuss with your partner how you know each number line is the solution to its inequality. </p>
<p>When you think you’ve found the correct number line for an inequality, substitute a test point that is on the highlighted part of the number line into the inequality. Is it true?</p>
<p>Try a test point that is not highlighted. Is the inequality false? <br/>

<li>Is there anything unique about the method used to solve \(–\frac12x\leq1\)? Explain.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Yes. The inequality contains a less than or equal to symbol \((\leq)\). However, in the solution there is a greater than or equal to symbol \((\geq)\). When using the Multiplication and Division Properties of Inequality, you must reverse the symbol when you multiply or divide by a negative number.</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Remind students that reversing the inequality symbol in a statement does not apply when adding or subtracting a negative number on both sides of an inequality. It only applies to multiplying or dividing with a negative number.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Discuss how the Properties of Inequalities are similar to the Properties of Equality. Emphasize that performing the same action to each side of the inequality or equation maintains the truth of the statement. Mention that to solve the inequality, the goal is still to isolate the variable.</p>
<p>It should be remembered that the Multiplication and Division Properties of Inequality are unique because when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, the inequality symbol must be reversed to maintain the inequality’s truth.</p>

<h3>Solving Linear Inequalities</h3>
<p>A linear inequality is much like a linear equation—but the equal sign is replaced with an inequality sign. So, when we solve linear equations, we are able to use the properties of equality to add, subtract, multiply, or divide both sides and still keep the equality. Similar properties hold true for inequalities.</p>
<p>We can add or subtract the same quantity from both sides of an inequality and still keep the inequality. For example:</p>
<br/>
<p><img alt="First example shows negative 4 is less than 2. The quantity of negative 4 minus 5 is less than the quantity of 2 minus 5. This yields negative 9 less than negative 3, which is true. 
The second example shows negative 4 is less than 2. The quantity of negative 4 plus 7 is less than the quantity of 2 plus 7. This results in 3 less than 9, which is true." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/65d84793ccf7def97bb9e482b51b063196edf254"/></p>
<br/>
<p>Notice that the inequality sign stayed the same.</p>
<p>This leads us to the Addition and Subtraction Properties of Inequality.</p>
<h5>Addition and Subtraction Properties of Inequality</h5>
<hr/>
<p>For any numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), if \(a&lt;b\), then</p>
<p align="center">\(a+c&lt;b+c\)       \(a−c&lt;b−c\)</p>
<p>For any numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), if \(a&gt;b\), then </p>
<p align="center">\(a+c&gt;b+c\)       \(a−c&gt;b−c\)</p>
<p>We can add or subtract
  the same quantity from both sides of an inequality and still keep the
  inequality.</p>
<br/>
<p>What happens to an inequality when we divide or multiply both sides by a constant?</p>
<p>Let’s first multiply and divide both sides by a positive number.</p>
<p><img alt="First example shows 10 is less than 15. The quantity of 10 times 5 is less than the quantity of 15 times 5. This yields 50 less than 75, which is true. 
The second example shows 10 is less than 15. The quantity of 10 divided by 5 is less than the quantity of 15 divided by 5. This results in 2 less than 3, which is true." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/a2e4b2e72fb097d63fa37dcb10ad973ab98dbeec"/><br/>
</p>
<p>The inequality signs stayed the same.</p>
<p>Does the inequality stay the same when we divide or multiply by a negative number?</p>
<p><img alt="First example shows 10 is less than 15. The quantity of 10 times negative 5 is blank the quantity of 15 times negative 5. This yields negative 50 blank negative 75. Negative 50 is greater than negative 75.  
The second example shows 10 is less than 15. The quantity of 10 divided by negative 5 is blank the quantity of 15 divided by negative 5. This results in negative 2 blank negative 3. Negative 2 is greater than negative 3." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/0a933b3ce50677d122b976a29bcaac88bf759939"/><br/>
</p>
<p>Notice that when we filled in the inequality signs, the inequality signs reversed their direction.</p>
<p>When we divide or multiply an inequality by a positive number, the inequality sign stays the same. When we divide or multiply an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign reverses.</p>
<p>This gives us the Multiplication and Division Properties of Inequality.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="os-raise-graybox">
<h5>Multiplication and Division Properties of Inequality</h5>
<hr/>
<p>For any numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\),</p>
<p>multiply or divide by a positive</p>
<p>if \(a&lt; b\) and \(c &gt; 0\), then \(ac &lt; bc\) and \(\frac ac&lt;\frac bc\)</p>
<p>if \(a&gt; b\) and \(c &gt; 0\), then \(ac &gt; bc\) and \(\frac ac&gt;\frac bc\)<br/>
</p>
<p>Multiply or divide by a negative</p>
<p>if \(a&lt; b\) and \(c &lt; 0\), then \(ac &gt; bc\) and \(\frac ac&gt;\frac bc\)<br/>
</p>
<p>if \(a&gt; b\) and \(c &lt; 0\), then \(ac &lt; bc\) and \(\frac ac&lt;\frac bc\)<br/>
</p>
</div>
<br/>
<p>When we divide or multiply an inequality by a:</p>
<ul>
<li>positive number, the inequality stays the same.</li>
<li>negative number, the inequality reverses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes when solving an inequality, as in the next example, the variable ends up on the right. We can rewrite the inequality in reverse to get the variable to the left.</p>
<p>\(x&gt;a\) has the same meaning as \(a&lt;x\).</p>
<p>Think about it as “If Xander is taller than Andy, then Andy is shorter than Xander.”</p>
<br/>
<p>In Examples 1 and 2: solve the inequality, graph the solution on the number line, and write the solution in interval notation.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1: </strong>\(x\;-\;\frac38\;\leq\;\frac34\)<br/>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1 - </strong>Add \(\frac38\) to both sides of the inequality.<br/>
</p>
<p>\(x-\frac38 +\frac38\leq\frac34+\frac38\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Simplify.<br/>
</p>
<p>\(x\leq\frac98\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 - </strong>Graph the solution on the number line.<br/>
</p>
<img alt="A number line with a closed bracket is graphed at the fractional value of nine-eighths. A bold arrowed line extending left, shades the numbers less than nine-eighths." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c83e52917f88c52d6badd18fc875c88fbf4621c8"/> <br/>
<br/>
<p><strong>Step 4 - </strong>Write the solution in interval notation.</p>
<p>\((-\infty,\frac98]\)</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> \(-15 &lt; \frac35z\)<br/>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1 - </strong>Multiply both sides of the inequality by \(\frac53\). Since \(\frac53\) is positive, the inequality
  stays the same.<br/>
</p>
<p>\((\frac53)(-15) \lt (\frac53)(\frac35z)\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Simplify.<br/>
</p>
<p>\(-25\lt z\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 - </strong>Rewrite with the variable on the left.<br/>
</p>
<p>\(z \gt -25\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 - </strong>Graph the solution on the number line.<br/>
</p>
<img alt="A number line with an open parenthesis is graphed at negative 25. A bold arrowed line extending right, shades the numbers greather than negative 25." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4f24f66df266a47807d84a9fd9dd8e8d95c26cc2"/> <br/>
<br/>
<p><strong>Step 5 - </strong>Write the solution in interval notation.</p>
<p>\((-25,\infty)\)</p>
