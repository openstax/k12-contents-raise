</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Yes. The inequality contains a less than or equal to symbol \((\leq)\). However, in the solution there is a greater than or equal to symbol \((\geq)\). When using the Multiplication and Division Properties of Inequality, you must reverse the symbol when you multiply or divide by a negative number.</p>
 
  <h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
  <p dir="ltr">Remind students that reversing the inequality symbol in a statement does not apply when adding or subtracting a negative number on both sides of an inequality. It only applies to multiplying or dividing with a negative number.</p>
  <h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
  <p dir="ltr">Discuss how the Properties of Inequalities are similar to the Properties of Equality. Emphasize that performing the same action to each side of the inequality or equation maintains the truth of the statement. Mention that to solve the inequality, the goal is still to isolate the variable.</p>
  <p dir="ltr">It should be remembered that the Multiplication and Division Properties of Inequality are unique because when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, the inequality symbol must be reversed to maintain the inequality&rsquo;s truth.</p><br>

  <h3>Solving Linear Inequalities</h3>
  <p >A linear inequality is much like a linear equation&mdash;but the equal sign is replaced with an inequality sign. So, when we solve linear equations, we are able to use the properties of equality to add, subtract, multiply, or divide both sides and still keep the equality. Similar properties hold true for inequalities.</p>
  <p >We can add or subtract the same quantity from both sides of an inequality and still keep the inequality. For example:</p><br>
  <p >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="Negative 4 is less than 2. Negative 4 minus 5 is less than 2 minus 5. Negative 9 is less than negative 3, which is true. Negative 4 is less than 2. Negative 4 plus 7 is less than 2 plus 7. 3 is less than 9, which is true." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/65d84793ccf7def97bb9e482b51b063196edf254"></p><br>
  <p >Notice that the inequality sign stayed the same.</p>
  <p >This leads us to the Addition and Subtraction Properties of Inequality.</p>
