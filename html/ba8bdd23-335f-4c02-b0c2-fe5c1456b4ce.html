<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 1</p>
<p>Write the explicit formula for the sequence given by the terms 3, 2, 43, 89 ...</p>
<h5>Solution:&nbsp;</h5>
<p><strong>Step 1- </strong>Write the general formula.<br>
\(a_n = a_1 (r^{n-1})\)</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Substitute values for the first term, common difference/ratio, term number.&nbsp;<br>
\(a_1 = 3\), \(r = \frac23\)<br>
\(a_n = 3 (\frac 23)^{n-1}\)</p>
<p>So, the explicit formula for the sequence 3, 2, 43, 89 ... is \(a_n = 3 (\frac23)^{n-1}\).</p>
<p>Just like it is with arithmetic sequences, the explicit formula makes finding any term easier to determine - especially term numbers that are very large!</p>

<p>Find the 14th term of a sequence where the first term is 64 and the common ratio, \(r =\frac 12\).&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Solution:</h5>
<p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> Write the general formula.<br>
\(a_n = a_1 (r^{n-1})\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Substitute values for the first term, common difference/ratio, term number.<br>
\(a_1 = 64\), \(r = \frac12\), \(n = 14\)<br>
\(a_{14} = 64 (\frac12)^{14-1}\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 -</strong> Simplify the expression.<br>
\(a_{14} = 64 (\frac12)^{13}\)<br>
\(a_{14} = 64 (\frac12)^{13}\)<br>
\(a_{14} = 64 (\frac{1}{8192})\)<br>
\(a_{14} = \frac{1}{128}\)</p>
 <p>If the explicit formula for this question was needed, we would not have substituted \(n = 14\) and the nth term formula would have been \(a_n = 64 (\frac12)^{n-1}\). </p>
