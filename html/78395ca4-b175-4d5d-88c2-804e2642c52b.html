<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Write a system of equations from tables of values and graphs. </li>
  <li> Graph systems of equations by hand. </li>
  <li> Estimate real-world solutions by graphing systems of equations. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 2.2.1: Interpreting Graphs of Systems of Equations </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you looked at a graph of a system of equations and thought about what you noticed and wondered. You then estimated the \(y\)-intercept and slope of each equation that was graphed. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 2.2.2: Writing Systems of Equations from Tables </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you created a table of values for a given situation then wrote a system of equations from two tables of values. </li>
    <li> 2.2.2: Self Check </li>
    <li> 2.2.2: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 2.2.3: Graphs of Systems of Equation </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you wrote a system of equations from a graph, then worked backward to graph a system of equations by hand given the equations. </li>
    <li> 2.2.3: Self Check </li>
    <li> 2.2.3: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 2.2.4: Systems of Equations in the Real-World </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you wrote a system of equations for a given situation, then graphed the system and estimated the solution from the graph. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
