<h4>Comparing the Graphs and Equations of Quadratic Functions</h4>
<p>Jai kicks a football. The graph that represents the height of the football, \(h\), as a function of time, in seconds, is below.</p>

<p>Kellan kicks a football and the height in feet, \(h\), is represented by the function \(h(t)=(-16t-1)(t-6)\).</p>
<p>Which player’s football stayed in the air longer?</p>
<p>Jai’s football landed after 4 seconds since the zero is at \(x=4\). The other zero, where \(x\) is negative, does not make sense in this problem.</p>
<p>Looking at the function of Kellan’s ball, find the zeros by setting each factor equal to zero.</p>
<ul>
<li> \(-16t-1=0\) becomes \(t=\frac{-1}{16}\). A negative time does not make sense in this problem. </li>
<li> \(t-6=0\) becomes \(t=6\). </li>
</ul>
<p>Kellan’s ball was in the air for 6 seconds, so his ball stayed in the air 2 seconds longer than Jai’s.</p>

<p>Here is how to determine whose ball went higher:</p>
<p>Looking at the graph of Jai’s football, his football went about 70 feet high.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - For Kellan’s football, find the vertex.<br/>
    The vertex is halfway between the zeros. Since \(\frac{-1}{16}\) is near 0 and the other \(x\)-intercept is at 6, we can use 3 as an estimate for the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Substitute this into the function:<br/>
    \(h(t)=(-16(3)-1)((3)-6)=(-49)(-3)=147\).</p>
<p>Kellan’s ball went 147 feet into the air so his football went higher.</p>
