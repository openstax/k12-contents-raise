<h3>Activity (10 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students are introduced to the idea that some functions can be defined by a rule, and the rule can be described in words or with expressions and equations. Students examine some simple rules and make connections between their verbal and algebraic representations. Doing so prompts them to look for and make use of structure.</p>
<p>The algebraic statements are written in function notation, so the work also reinforces students&rsquo; understanding of the notation and expands their capacity to use it to describe functions.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Display an image of a &ldquo;function machine&rdquo; with &ldquo;cube the input&rdquo; as the rule.</p>
<br>
<p><img alt="A function machine." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c8fee7d06165c318823b9b3e727250edfbdc6a8f"></p>
<p>Tell students that a function takes any input and cubes it to generate the output. Ask students to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the output when the inputs are 0, 1, 3, and \(x\).</li>
<li>Write the input-output relationship using function notation and name the function \(g\).</li>
</ul>
<p>\(g(0)=0\)<br>
    \(g(1)=1\)<br>
    \(g(3)=27\)<br>
    \(g(x)= x^3\)<br>
</p>
<p>If not mentioned by students, point out that these equations describe the same function as that shown by the second table in the warm-up.</p>
<p>Explain to students that some functions have a specific rule for getting the output. The rule can be described in words (like &ldquo;cube the input&rdquo;) or with expressions (such as \(x^3\)). Tell students that they&rsquo;ll now look at some rules expressed in both ways.</p>
<h4>Support for Students with Disabilities</h4>
<div>
<p>Chunk this task into more manageable parts to differentiate the degree of difficulty or complexity. Give students a subset of the expressions and descriptions to start with and hold a brief small-group or whole-class discussion once students have completed the first match. Invite 1&ndash;2 students to share their strategies for finding a match before introducing the remaining expressions and descriptions.</p>
</div><br>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement<br></h4>
<ol>
<li>Match each equation with a verbal description that represents the same function. Record your results.
        <ol type="a">
<li>\(f(x)=3x-7\)</li>
<li>\(g(x) =3(x&minus;7)\)</li>
<li>\(h(x)\;=\;\frac x3-7\)</li>
<li>\(k(x)\;=\frac{x-7}3\)<br>
<br></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For one of the functions, when the input is 6, the output is &ndash;3. Which is that function: \(f\), \(g\), \(h\), or \(k\)? Explain how you know.
        <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Which function value, \(f(x)\), \(g(x)\), \(h(x)\), or \(k(x)\), is the greatest when the input is 0? What about when the input is 10?</li>
</ol>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>Mai says f(x) is always greater than g(x) for the same value of x. Is this true? Explain how you know.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol type="a">
<li>To get the output, multiply the input by 3, then subtract 7 from the result.</li>
<li>To get the output, subtract 7 from the input, then multiply the result by 3</li>
<li>To get the output, divide the input by 3, and then subtract 7 from the result.</li>
<li>To get the output, subtract 7 from the input, then divide the result by 3.
                <br>
<br>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Function \(g\), because when \(x\) is 6, the expression \( 3(x&minus;7)\) has a value of &ndash;3.
        <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>When \(x\) is 0, \(k(x)\) has the greatest value. When \(x\) is 10, \(f(x)\) has the greatest value.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Student-Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>Mai says \(f(x)\) is always greater than \(g(x)\) for the same value of \(x\). Is this true? Explain how you know.</p>
<h4>Extension Student Response</h4>
<p>Yes. Here is a possible explanation: Rewrite \(g(x)\) as \(g(x)=3x&minus;21\). Then, to get the output of both functions, we first multiply the input, \(x\), by 3 to get \(3x\), and then we subtract a value from it. For function \(f\), we subtract 7. For function \(g\), we subtract 21. The output of \(g\) will always be 14 less than that of \(f\).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to briefly share how they matched the equations and verbal descriptions in the first question. Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The expressions for functions \(f\) and \(g\)<em> </em>both involve multiplying by 3 and subtracting 7. How are they different?&rdquo; (The order in which the operations happen is different. Function \(f\) first multiplies the input by 3, and then 7 is subtracted from the result. Function \(g\)&nbsp;first subtracts 7, and then multiplies the result by 3. </li>
<li>&ldquo;The expressions for \(h\) and \(k\)<em>&nbsp;</em>both involve subtracting 7 and dividing by 3. How did you decide which one corresponds to description A and which one corresponds to D?&rdquo; (By looking at what is done to \(x\)&nbsp;first. In \(h\), \(x\)<em>&nbsp;</em>is divided by 3 before 7 is subtracted, so it must correspond to D.) </li>
</ul>
<p>Next, ask students how they determined which function has \((6,-3)\) as an input-output pair and which function has the greatest output when \(x\)&nbsp;is 0 and when \(x\) is 10. Highlight explanations that mention evaluating each function at those input values and seeing which one generates &ndash;3 for the output or gives the greatest output.</p>
<p>The functions in this activity are given without a context. Tell students that they will now look at rules that describe relationships between quantities in situations.</p>
<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<div>
<p>Use this routine to support whole-class discussion as students explain how they matched the descriptions to the equations. Display the following sentence frames for all to see: &ldquo;The equation _____ matches _____ because . . .&rdquo; and &ldquo;I noticed _____, so . . . .&rdquo; Encourage students to challenge each other when they disagree. If necessary, re-voice student ideas to demonstrate using mathematical language such as &ldquo;input&rdquo; and &ldquo;output.&rdquo; This will help students use the structure of equations to make connections between equations and descriptions of functions.</p>

<h4>Evaluating Functions with Function Notation</h4>
<p><strong>Find the Value of a Function</strong><br>
    It is very convenient to name a function, and most often we name it \(f\), \(g\), or \(h\). In any function, for each \(x\)-value from the domain we get a corresponding \(y\)-value in the range. For the function \(f\), we write this range value \(y\) as \(f(x)\). This is called function notation and is read \(f\) of \(x\) or the value of \(f\) at \(x\). In this case, the parentheses do not indicate multiplication.</p>
<h5>Function Notation</h5>
<p>For the function \(y=f(x)\):</p>
<ul>
<li>\(f\) is the name of the function.</li>
<li>\(x\) is the input value.</li>
<li>\(f(x)\) is the output value, \(y\), corresponding to the value of \(x\).</li>
</ul>
<p>We read \(f(x)\) as \(f\) of \(x\) or the value of \(f\) at \(x\).</p>
<p>We call \(x\) the independent variable as it can be any value in the domain. We call \(y\) the dependent variable as its value depends on \(x\).</p>
<h5>Independent and Dependent Variables</h5>
<p>For the function \(y=f(x)\),</p>
<p>\(x\) is the independent variable as it can be any value.</p>
<p>\(y\) is the dependent variable as its value depends on \(x\).</p>
<br>
<p>Much as when you first encountered the variable \(x\), function notation may be rather unsettling. It seems strange because it is new. You will feel more comfortable with the notation as you use it.</p>
<br>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the equation \(y=4x-5\). To find the value of \(y\) when \(x=2\), we know to substitute \(x=2\) into the equation and then simplify.</p>
<br>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col>
<col>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Original Equation</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>\(y=4x&minus;5\)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Substitute \(x=2\) in for \(x\).</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>\(y=4(2)-5\)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Simplify.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>\(y=3\)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The value of the function at \(x=2\) is 3.</p>
<p>We can do the same thing using function notation. The equation \(y=4x-5\) can be written as \(f(x)=4x-5\). To find the value when \(x=2\), we write:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col>
<col>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Original Equation</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>\(f(x)=4x&minus;5\)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Substitute \(x=2\) in for \(x\).</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>\(f(2)=4(2)-5\)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Simplify.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>\(f(2)=3\)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The value of the function at \(x=2\) is 3.</p>
<p>This process of finding the value of \(f(x)\) for a given value of \(x\) is called evaluating the function.</p>
