<li>Draw a diagram to show that \((3x+1)(x+2)\) is equivalent to \(3x^2+7x+2\).</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Diagram should show partial products of \(3x(x)\), \(6x\), \(x\), and 2, which add up to \(3x^2+7x+2\).</p>
<p><img alt="An area model using a rectangle is divided into 4 smaller rectangles with both vertical and horizontal segments. The top left section of the rectangle is labeled x and the top right section of the rectangle is labeled 2. The top left side length of the rectangle is labeled 3 times x and the bottom left side length of the rectangle is labeled 1. There are four areas inside the rectangle: The top left area that is bordered by x and 3x is labled 3 times x squared. The top right area under the 2 is labeled 6 times x. In the bottom row, the left region is labeled x and the right region is labeled 2." height="174" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/7cd83e7946410aa753c891045d8c29dbbf01b4cd" width="262"/></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li>Is \((x+4)^2\) equivalent to \(2x^2+8x+8\)? Explain or show your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>No. \((x+4)(x+4)=x^2+4x+4x+16=x^2+8x+16\). </p>
