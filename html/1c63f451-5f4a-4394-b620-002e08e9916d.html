<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>The height in feet, \(h\), of a stomp rocket (propelled by a short blast of air) above the ground after \(t\) seconds is given by the equation \(h(t)=5+100t-16t^2\). Here is a graph that represents \(h\).</p>
<p><img alt="Graph of the quadratic function h(t)=5+100t&minus;16t2 on a coordinate plane, origin O . Horizontal axis scale 0 to 7 by 1&rsquo;s, labeled &ldquo;time (seconds)&rdquo;. Vertical axis scale 0 to 200 by&nbsp;50&rsquo;s, labeled &ldquo;height above ground (feet)&rdquo;. Some of the points are (0 comma 5), (1 comma 89), (2 comma 141), (3 comma 161) to a maximum near (3 point 125 comma 161 point 25), then decreasing through (4 comma 149), (5 comma 105), (6 comma 29) and (6.3 comma 0)." height="224" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/d0ccc1cc8868a37a9b8d36885521542357c523b6" width="305"></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>How does the 5 in the equation relate to the graph?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The graph intersects the vertical axis at 5.
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>What does \(100t\) in the equation mean in terms of the rocket?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>It indicates that the initial velocity of the rocket was 100 feet per second upward.
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>What does the \(-16t^2\) mean in terms of the rocket?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;This indicates the effect of gravity pulling the rocket back toward Earth.
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li> About when does the rocket hit the ground?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;At about 6.3 seconds.
  </li>

<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
