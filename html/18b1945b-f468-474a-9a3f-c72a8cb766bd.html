<p>In this lesson, you will find the solutions to systems of linear inequalities in two variables.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Write a system of inequalities to describe a situation, find the solution by graphing, and interpret points in the solution.</li>
  <li>Explain what is meant by &ldquo;the solutions to a system of inequalities&rdquo; and describe the graphs that represent the solutions.</li>
  <li>Find values that satisfy each constraint individually, and values that satisfy both constraints at once, when given descriptions and graphs that represent two different constraints.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
