<h3>Cool Down Activity</h3>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
  <li>The graph shows the population of a city from 1900 to 2000. </li>
<p><img alt="A graph.&nbsp;" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/1903c3abc2af4c6a8ec0ea2c81f2b371a971b2b3"></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="1">
  <li>What is the average rate of change of the population between 1930 and 1950? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li> For each interval, decide if the average rate of change is positive or negative. </li>

<h4> Student Response</h4>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Compare your answer to the sample response: About 250 people per year. The population was 40,000 in 1930 and about 45,000 in 1950, an increase of 5,000 people over 20 years, which equals 250 people per year.<br>
