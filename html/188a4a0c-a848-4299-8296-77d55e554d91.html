<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="1">
  <li>What is the average rate of change of the population between 1930 and 1950? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p> <strong>Answer: </strong> Compare your answer to the sample response: About 250 people per year. The population was 40,000 in 1930 and about 45,000 in 1950, an increase of 5,000 people over 20 years, which equals 250 people per year.<br>

  <li aria-level="1"> In which decade (10-year interval) did the population grow the fastest? Explain how you know. </li>
</ol>  <p> <strong>Answer: </strong> From 1910 to 1920. For example: The graph has the steepest slope between the two points on the graph \((1910,22)\) and \((1920,32)\).</p>
