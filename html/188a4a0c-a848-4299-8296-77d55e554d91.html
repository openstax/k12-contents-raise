<h3>Cool Down Activity</h3>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">The graph shows the population of a city from 1900 to 2000. </li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="A graph.&nbsp;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/im-ims-export/nfydLSjSnZHDq31H45RHwTDj"></p>
<p>What is the average rate of change of the population between 1930 and 1950? Show your reasoning.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li> For each interval, decide if the average rate of change is positive or negative. </li>
<ol type="A">
<li> from 1930 to 1940 </li>
<li>from 1950 to 1970</li>
<li> from 1930 to 1970 </li>
</ol>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li aria-level="1"> In which decade (10-year interval) did the population grow the fastest? Explain how you know. </li>
</ol>
<h4> Student Response</h4>
<ol>
<li>Compare your answer to the sample response: About 250 people per year. The population was 40,000 in 1930 and about 45,000 in 1950, an increase of 5,000 people over 20 years, which equals 250 people per year.<br>

<ol type="A">
<li>Positive </li>
<li>Negative </li>
<li>Negative <br>
<br>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>From 1910 to 1920. Sample reasoning: The graph has the steepest slope between the two points on the graph \((1910,22)\) and \((1920,32)\).</li>
