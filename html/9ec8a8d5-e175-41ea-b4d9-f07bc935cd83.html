<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Ask students to come up with a sequence of 5 numbers that follows some rule and write it down on a piece of paper. After a brief quiet time to think individually, tell students to exchange papers with their partners and then try to find the next term in their partner&rsquo;s sequence along with the rule they used. </p>
<p>Conclude the lesson by inviting students to share a sequence and rule their partner wrote that they found interesting. Display these for all to see while students share. </p>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
