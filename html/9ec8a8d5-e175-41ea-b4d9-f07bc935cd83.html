<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Ask students to come up with a sequence of 5 numbers that follows some rule and write it down on a piece of paper. After a brief quiet time to think individually, tell students to exchange papers with their partners and then try to find the next term in their partner&rsquo;s sequence along with the rule they used. </p>
<p>Conclude the lesson by inviting students to share a sequence and rule their partner wrote that they found interesting. Display these for all to see while students share. </p>
