<h4>Distinguish Linear Patterns from Nonlinear Patterns&nbsp;</h4>
<p dir="ltr">A scatter plot is a graph of numerical data with two variables. If two variables vary together in a predictable way, we say there is a statistical relationship between the two variables.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>When the points of the scatter plot seem to fall along a line, the scatter plot is linear.</li>
  <li>Nonlinear patterns seem to follow a curve.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If the scatter plot shows no pattern, it means there is no relationship between the variables.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Try It: Distinguish Linear Patterns from Nonlinear Patterns</h4>
<p>At a dinner party, every person shakes hands with every other person present. The scatter plot shows the number of people, x, and the number of handshakes, y.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Here is how to describe the relationship:</p>
    <p>The scatter plot shows that the number of handshakes increases as the number of people increases. The increase is not at a constant rate, so the relationship is nonlinear.</p>
