  <li>
    &#128172; Discuss with your group: How does your area model compare to those in your group? What is the same? What is different? <br>
  </li><br>

<li>Justify how you know your model represents 17x13. Does your area model represent 17âœ•13? How do you know? &#128172;<br></li>
<br>


  <li>
    Challenge yourself to work through levels 1-2 of the Area Model Numbers Game!
    In this challenge, students are given different rectangular scenarios and asked to determine partial products, dimensions, etc. Students may choose their level of difficulty/challenge.
  </li>

<br>
<li>  What are three different ways you could partition 17? </li>
<br>

  <li>
    Write your own 2-digit times 2-digit multiplication problem that uses an area model, and find the total area. 
  </li> 
  <br>

<p>
  <li>What is a convenient way to break up a multiplication problem into an area model, and why is it convenient for you?</li>
