<p>In this activity, whenever you see 💬, stop and share your responses with your partner. If you have different responses, try to come to a consensus.</p>
<p>For 1 - 4, use the prompt and instructions below.</p>
<blockquote>Suppose we want to find the product of 17 and 13 using an area model. Use the simulation screens labeled “Explore” and “Generic”. Note you can switch between using the toolbar located below the area model.</blockquote>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>Draw and label your partitions on the scaled area model below.</li>

<li>
    Draw and label your partitions on the generic model below. <br/>

The left line is blue." height="300" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/5d7078d0d035592651c72ffe93732201515db380"/><br/>
</li><br/>
<li>
    Discuss with your group: How does your area model compare to those in your group? What is the same? What is different? 💬 <br/>
</li><br/>
<li>Justify how you know your model represents 17x13. Does your area model represent 17✕13? How do you know? 💬<br/></li>
<br/>
<li>
  Challenge yourself to work through levels 1-2 of the <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/area-model-algebra/latest/area-model-algebra_en.html?screens=4ß" target="_blank">Area Model Numbers Game</a>!<br/>
</li>
<br/>
<li>  What are three different ways you could partition 17? </li>
<br/>
<li>
    Write your own 2-digit times 2-digit multiplication problem that uses an area model, and find the total area. 
  </li>
<br/>
<p>
<li>What is a convenient way to break up a multiplication problem into an area model, and why is it convenient for you?</li>
</p>
