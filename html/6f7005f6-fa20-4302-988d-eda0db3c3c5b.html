<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity prompts students to look at how the \(x\)-intercept is affected by horizontal translations of the graph of a linear function. During the lesson, the examples relate the shift to point-slope form. Circulate to ensure students are graphing their lines properly. If necessary, partner students during the graphing process.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Remind students of the discussion about playing board games. During this previous discussion, students connected rolling dice and moving that number of spots to the number of spots a line can shift up or down on the graph. Let them know that graphs can also move left and right. </p>
<p>For students who can benefit from a more accessible model, use geoboards and rubber bands. Use one color rubber band for the ùë•- and ùë¶-axes. Use a different color for each line graphed. Work with students to count spots on the geoboard and discuss the graphs and their relationships.</p>

<p>In linear functions, when a value is added to or subtracted from the input value, or the \(x\)-values, the graph acts as if a horizontal shift is applied. This is another type of transformation to the graph.</p>
<div class="os-raise-graybox">
<h5>Horizontal Shift of a Function</h5>
<p>A horizontal shift ‚Äútransforms‚Äù the parent function into another function by moving the graph to the left or right \(c\) units.</p>
<p align="center">Horizontal Shift ‚Üí \(f(x - c)\)</p>
</div>
<br/>
<p>If the \(c\) value is positive, the graph of the function shifts right. If the \(c\) value is negative, the graph of the function shifts left. 
<br/>
    But, be careful! The sign of the \(c\) value is preceded by subtraction in the equation. When the equation is simplified, the sign of the \(c\) value is changed.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to create other questions for students to answer about how much one linear function must shift to get to another.</p>
<p>Press students to describe how to determine if a shifted line is a horizontal or vertical shift. For linear functions, this is difficult to determine. Urge students to identify the \(x-\) or \(y\)-intercepts and then define the transformation based on what happens to that point. This method is similar to the process students used when transforming geometric figures in middle school. </p>
<h4>4.11.3: Self Check</h4>
<p>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>Which graph represents \(f(x-5)\) when \(f(x) = x\), the linear parent function? The parent function is represented by the dashed, blue line. </p>

<h3>4.11.3: Additional Resources</h3>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold"><em>The following content is available to students who would like more support based on their experience

<h4>Horizontal Shifts and \(x\)-intercepts</h4>
<p>In addition to being shifted vertically, graphs can also be shifted to the right or left. For linear functions, this is sometimes hard to identify because a line that is shifted horizontally may appear to have a vertical shift.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs shift the parent function, \( f(x) = x \), horizontally to the left 7 units.</p>
<p>If the line shifts horizontally 7 units to the left, the \(x\)-intercept is shifted 7 units to the left, as well.</p>
<p><img alt="A graph shows two lines: a solid blue line with positive slope passing through the origin, and a dashed red line with positive slope passing through (negative 2, negative 2) on an x-y grid." height="400" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/473a1bd03c873b8c6738166daf8c81a343ec0f06"/></p>
<p>The graph of the parent function, \( f(x) = x \), is represented by the dashed orange line. The graph of the solid blue line represents the line that we horizontally shift 7 units to the left.</p>
<p>To determine the equation of the shifted line, we use the slope of 1 and \((-7, 0)\) as a point on the line.</p>
<p>Substituting these values into point-slope form, we get:</p>
<p>\[
(y - y_1) = m(x - x_1) \\
(y - 0) = 1(x - (-7)) \\
y = 1(x + 7)
\]</p>
<p>So, the equation of a line that has been shifted 7 units to the left from the parent function, \( f(x) = x \), is \( y = x + 7 \)</p>
<p>But, doesn‚Äôt it look like the function \( f(x) = x + 7 \) was shifted up 7 units, too? This is because \( f(x) = x+7 \) is equivalent to \( f(x) = 1(x+7) \). And this is what makes horizontal shifts difficult to see.</p>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>How has the function \( f(x) = 3(x-4) \) been transformed from \( f(x) = 3x \)?</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
To answer this question, first consider how the x-values, including the \(x\)-intercept, are being changed. The function says to subtract 4 from each x-value. This means the function is being shifted 4 units.</p>
<p>Next, we need to determine which direction the x-values are being shifted. Let‚Äôs look at the graphs.</p>
<p><img alt="Graph with x and y axes from -10 to 10. A red dashed line passes through (0, 1), and a blue line passes through (3,0). There are open green circles at points (1,3) and (5,3) on the graph, and points (0,0) and (4,0) are marked with a black open circle." height="400" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b04cfb3fd3c833fe8497dd2ddb486a63971f72b9"/></p>
<p>The solid blue line represents the graph of \( f(x) = 3(x-4) \). The dashed orange line represents the graph of \( f(x) = x \).</p>
<p>On the graph, we can look at specific points on the parent function like the \(x\)-intercept (0, 0) and (1, 3). The transformed line is to the right of our parent function. To determine how far to the right the line has been shifted, we count the number of horizontal units between the lines.</p>
<ul>
<li>We see that (0, 0) corresponds to the point (4, 0) on the transformed line.</li>
<li>The point (1, 3) corresponds to the point (5, 3) on the transformed line.</li>
<li>Each point on the parent function has been shifted 4 units to the right.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, we conclude the line representing \( f(x) = 3(x-4) \) appears to have been shifted 4 units to the right from the function \( f(x) = 3x \).</p>
<h3>Example 2</h3>
<p>Use the \(x\)-intercept to describe how the function \( f(x) = x+9 \) has been transformed from the parent function \( f(x) = x \).</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
We know the shift is 9 units, but we need to consider which direction the \(x\)-intercept has been moved.</p>
<p><img alt="Graph with solid blue line passing through (negative 9, negative 9) and (0, 0), and dashed orange line passing through (0, 0) and (2, negative 2), both with labeled axes and gridlines." height="400" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4868b90ecdb6f3cbad106c8514e6036083d83d6f"/></p>
<p>The orange dashed line represents the parent function, \( f(x) = x \) and the solid blue line represents the shifted function.</p>
<p>Carefully looking at the \(x\)-intercepts, we see the line representing \( f(x) = x+9 \) has been shifted 9 units to the left from the parent function, \( f(x)=x \).</p>
<p>Often the horizontal shift is denoted using parentheses to explicitly identify how the values of the independent variable, or domain, are being changed.</p>
<h3>Example 3</h3>
<p>Describe how the function \( f(x) = ¬Ω (x + 4) \) is horizontally transformed to \( g(x) = ¬Ω (x - 2) \).</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>
Let‚Äôs rewrite the equations in point-slope form, \((y - y_{1}) = m(x - x_{1})\):
</p>
<p>\[
\begin{align*}
f(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{2}(x + 4) \\
(y - 0) &amp;= \frac{1}{2}(x + 4) \\
(y - 0) &amp;= \frac{1}{2}(x -(- 4))
\end{align*}
\]</p>
<p>So, the \(x\)-intercept is \((-4, 0)\).</p>
<p>\[
\begin{align*}
g(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{2}(x - 2) \\
(y - 0) &amp;= \frac{1}{2}(x - 2)
\end{align*}
\]</p>
<p>So, the \(x\)-intercept is \((2, 0)\).</p>
<p>The \(x\)-intercept of \( f(x) \) starts at \((-4,0)\) and moves to \((2, 0)\), so this represents a shift of 6 units to the right.</p>
<p>We can also check this using graphs.</p>
<p><img alt="A graph with two parallel lines, one red and dashed with a positive \(y\)-intercept, and one solid blue with a negative \(y\)-intercept." height="400" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4ad5e908d3ca5f3bcde124b0bc9737a3f1003040"/></p>
<p>Examining the \(x\)-intercept for \( f(x) = ¬Ω (x + 4) \), on the orange dashed line, we see that \((-4,0)\) gets shifted 6 units to the right and lands at \((2, 0)\) on \( g(x) = ¬Ω (x - 2) \), represented by the blue solid line.</p>
<p>So, we can identify horizontal shifts using either graphs or algebraic equations.</p>
<div class="os-raise-graybox">
<h5>Horizontal Shift of a Function</h5>
<p>A horizontal shift ‚Äútransforms‚Äù the parent function into another function by moving the graph to the left or right \(c\) units.</p>
<p align="center">Horizontal Shift ‚Üí \(f(x - c)\)</p>
</div>
<br/>
<p>If the \(c\) value is positive, the graph of the function shifts right. If the \(c\) value is negative, the graph of the function shifts left. 
<br/>
    But, be careful! The sign of the \(c\) value is preceded by subtraction in the equation. When the equation is simplified, the sign of the \(c\) value is changed.</p>
