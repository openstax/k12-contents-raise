     <p>\(p+n &lt; 20\) represents the total number of coins. The problem states that she has fewer than 20 coins. The number of pennies plus the number of nickels added together will be less than 20 coins.</p>
     <p>\(0.01p+0.05n &gt; 0.40\) represents the value of each coin. The value of a penny is 1 cent (0.01) the value of a nickel is 5 cents (0.05). The number of pennies multiplied by its value of 0.01 plus the number of nickels multiplied by its value 0.05 will give the total amount of money she has.
