<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm up reminds students that we can use the notation \(\sqrt{A}\) to express the side length of a square with area \(A\) and that the value of \(\sqrt{A}\) may not be a whole number or a fraction.</p>
<p>To find the area of a tilted square, students might choose different strategies:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> Decompose the square and rearrange the parts into rectangles. </li>
  <li> Enclose the tilted square with another square that is on the grid and subtract the areas of the extra triangles. </li>
  <li> Use the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate the squared value of the side length. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Display the entire task for all to see. Give students quiet time to think individually. Select students to share their responses and how they reasoned about the side length and area of each square.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here are some squares whose vertices are on a grid.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their solutions. It is not essential to discuss how students found the area. What is important is that students recall that we can use the square root notation \(\sqrt{9}\) to refer to the side length of a square with area 9 square units and that \(\sqrt{9}=3\). When the area is 2 or 10 square units, the square root of each number is not a whole number or a fraction, but we can write \(\sqrt{2}\) and \(\sqrt{10}\) rather than writing their decimal approximations.</p>
<p>Remind students that any positive number has two square roots because there are two numbers (one positive and one negative) that, when squared, give that number. Also remind students that the \(\sqrt{\;\;}\) symbol refers only to the positive square root of a number. In this context, if \(s\) is the side length of a square and \(A\) its area, we can describe the relationship between the two quantities as \(s=\sqrt{A}\) because only positive side lengths make sense.</p>
