<h3>Warm Up (10 minutes)</h3>
<br>
<p>This warm up reviews the ways students have already used certain types of information in order to write equations. Prior to the warm up, remind students to write down the point-slope form and slope-intercept form of equations, as well as the slope formula.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. For the last question, ask each partner to use a different point to write the equation.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>For numbers 1â€“3, write the equation of:</p>
<ol class="os-rase-noindent">
  <li> A line with a slope of 5 and a \(y\)-intercept of \(\frac12\). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(y = 5x + \frac12\)</p>
<ol class="os-rase-noindent" start="2">
  <li> A line with a slope of 2 that goes through \((-1, 3)\). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(y = \frac{1}{2} x + \frac72\)</p>
<ol class="os-rase-noindent" start="3">
  <li> A line that passes through \((2, 4)\) and \((1, -2)\). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(y=6x - 8\)</p>
<br>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to check their answers with their partner. For number 3, students should recognize that they arrived at the same answer, despite choosing different points. Have volunteers explain how they worked through each step.</p>
