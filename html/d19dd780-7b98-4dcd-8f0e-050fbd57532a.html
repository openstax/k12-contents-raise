<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In earlier lessons, students factored the standard form of a quadratic function to find its solutions, or zeros.
  Students will now be provided the zeros of a quadratic function and convert them into the factored form and standard
  form of that function.</p>
<p>Students will also distinguish between finding a quadratic function that has certain zeros and finding the specific
  quadratic function that has certain zeros and passes through a particular point. They will learn to differentiate
  between these related quadratic functions.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Convert fluently between a quadratic function's zeros, its factored form, and its standard form. </li>
  <li> Identify the zeros on the graph of a quadratic function and use them to write the standard form of that function.
  </li>
  <li> Use the intercept form of a quadratic function, \(f(x) = a(x &minus; p)(x &minus; q)\), to define a specific
    function given its zeros and a point. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)&nbsp;</h4>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Find the standard form of a quadratic function given its zeros. </li>
  <li> Find the standard form of a quadratic function given its graph. </li>
  <li> Use the intercept form of a quadratic function to define a specific function given its zeros and a point. </li>

    <h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
    <p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities
      are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language
      learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build
        and reinforce concept and language attainment
      </li>
      <li>A3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions </li>
      <li>A3(F) ask and give information ranging from using a very limited bank of high-frequency, high-need, concrete
        vocabulary, including key words and expressions needed for basic communication in academic and social contexts,
        to using abstract and content-based vocabulary during extended speaking assignments </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Support for Building Character</h4>
    <p>Throughout this unit, find ways to encourage and support students to work on cultivating their
      <strong>curiosity</strong>.</p>
