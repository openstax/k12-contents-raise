<h4>Interpret Linear Functions</h4>
<p>A linear function is a function that represents a line on the coordinate plane. A line can be written in slope-intercept form, \(y = mx + b\), where \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the \(y\)-intercept. The dependent variable is \(y\), and the independent variable is \(x\). The \(y\)&nbsp;can be replaced by \(f(x)\), so the function can be written as \(f(x) = mx + b\).</p>
<p>Andrei wants to fill a glass tank with marbles, each with the same volume, and then fill the remaining space with water. The function \(V(n) = 32 - 0.05n\) represents the volume of water, in liters, Andrei uses if he uses \(n\) marbles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can rewrite the function in slope-intercept form: \(V(n) = -0.05n + 32\). The slope is &ndash;0.05, and the \(y\)-intercept is 32.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li> What is the volume of the tank? </li>
</ol>
<p>\(V(n) = -0.05n + 32\) represents the volume left in the tank after \(n\) marbles were added. The volume of the tank is the initial volume before any of the marbles have been added, or \(V(0)\). \(V(0) = -0.05(0) + 32 = 32\). The volume of the tank is 32 liters.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li> What is the volume of each marble? </li>
</ol>
<p>The volume of water needed to fill the tank decreases by 0.05 liters each time Andrei puts in a marble, \(n\).<em>&nbsp;</em>This means that the volume of each marble is 0.05 liters.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The function \(D(t) = -38t + 220\) represents the remaining distance, \(D\), in meters after \(t\)<em>&nbsp;</em>seconds. The total distance she must travel is the initial value, or \(D(0)\). \(D(0) = -38(0) + 220 = 220\). The total distance she must travel is 220 meters.</p>

      <p>The amount of money that farmers in Massachusetts paid to maintain their crops between 1991 and 2008 is modeled by the function \(P = 3.53t + 100\), where \(P\)&nbsp;is the amount of money the farmers paid, in millions of dollars, and \(t\)&nbsp;is the year (with 1991 as \(t = 0\)).
