<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>Your teacher will give you either a problem card or a data card. Do not show or read your card to your partner.<br></p>
<p>If your teacher gives you the data card:<br></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Silently read the information on your card.</li>
  <li>Ask your partner, &ldquo;What specific information do you need?&rdquo; and wait for your partner to ask for information. Only give information that is on your card. (Do not figure out anything for your partner!)</li>
  <li>Before telling your partner the information, ask, &ldquo;Why do you need to know (that piece of information)?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Read the problem card and solve the problem independently.</li>
  <li>Share the data card and discuss your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your teacher gives you the problem card:<br></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Silently read your card and think about what information you need to answer the question.</li>
  <li>Ask your partner for the specific information that you need.</li>
  <li>Explain to your partner how you are using the information to solve the problem.</li>
  <li>When you have enough information, share the problem card with your partner, and solve the problem independently.</li>
  <li>Read the data card and discuss your reasoning.</li>
</ol>

        <li>No. The combination meets the rule about the total number of members, but does not meet the rule about the number of adults compared to the number of students. For example:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The point (8,6) is not in the shaded region of the graph representing the rule about children-to-adult ratio.      </li>
            <li>If 6 is substituted into the inequality representing the rule about children-to-adult ratio and then evaluated, the inequality, \(6 &le; \frac12 (8)\), is a false statement. </li>

    <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
      <li>Each team can have at least 8 people: 6 children and 2 adults. For example: The region where all three graphs overlap represent combinations that meet all three rules. The lowest numbers of children and adults in the region are 6 and 2. </li>
