<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>Your teacher will give you either a problem card or a data card. Do not show or read your card to your partner.<br></p>
<p>If your teacher gives you the data card:<br></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Silently read the information on your card.</li>
  <li>Ask your partner, &ldquo;What specific information do you need?&rdquo; and wait for your partner to ask for information. Only give information that is on your card. (Do not figure out anything for your partner!)</li>
  <li>Before telling your partner the information, ask, &ldquo;Why do you need to know (that piece of information)?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Read the problem card and solve the problem independently.</li>
  <li>Share the data card and discuss your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your teacher gives you the problem card:<br></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Silently read your card and think about what information you need to answer the question.</li>
  <li>Ask your partner for the specific information that you need.</li>
  <li>Explain to your partner how you are using the information to solve the problem.</li>
  <li>When you have enough information, share the problem card with your partner, and solve the problem independently.</li>
  <li>Read the data card and discuss your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<div class="os-raise-usermessage-lightbulb">
<p>Pause here so your teacher can review your work. Ask your teacher for a new set of cards and repeat the activity, trading roles with your partner.</p>

        <li>No. The combination meets the rule about the total number of members, but does not meet the rule about the number of adults compared to the number of students. For example:</li>

            <li>The point (8,6) is not in the shaded region of the graph representing the rule about children-to-adult ratio.      </li>

  <p>Coming up with snack mixes is not as simple as just combining ingredients for the company TERANGA. They must meet a series of requirements to make sure the snack mix is affordable and healthy. </p>
  <p>In this image, you can see the requirements of each snack mix translated into linear inequalities. TERANGA's team can use the linear inequalities to know exactly what combination of fruits and nuts to put into a mix that will not only be tasty, but will also be nutritious and affordable. Plus, the mix will make the company a nice profit.</p>
