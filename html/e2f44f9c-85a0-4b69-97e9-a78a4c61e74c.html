<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Recognize and use the appropriate method to factor a polynomial completely. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the<strong> activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li> 6.7.1: Factoring Strategies for Polynomials </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you identified all the polynomial factoring strategies you have learned in this unit. You created sample polynomials that would fit into each strategy. </li>
</ul>
<li> 6.7.2: Reviewing General Strategies to Factor a Polynomial </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you reviewed the strategies used to factor polynomials. When given a sample polynomial, you assessed it and determined an appropriate strategy for factoring. </li>
<li> 6.7.2: Self Check </li>
<li>6.7.2: Additional Resources</li>
</ul>
<li> 6.7.3: Implementing General Strategies for Factoring </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you used every strategy you have learned to factor different polynomials. You combined strategies to completely factor polynomials of many different forms. </li>
<li> 6.7.3: Self Check </li>
<li>6.7.3: Additonal Resources</li>
</ul>
<li> 6.7.4: Is the Polynomial Completely Factored? </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you analyzed different polynomials and assessed if they could be factored further or if each factor in the polynomial was prime. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
