    learned in this lesson.</em></p>
<p>For numbers 1â€“9, use the following scenario:<br>
  A car has a 16-gallon fuel tank. When driven on a highway, it has a gas mileage of 30 miles per gallon. The gas
  mileage (also called "fuel efficiency") tells us the number of miles the car can travel for a particular amount of
  fuel (one gallon of gasoline, in this case). After filling the gas tank, the driver got on a highway and drove for a
  while.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>How many miles has the car traveled if it has 15 gallons left in the tank?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 30</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>How many miles has the car traveled if it has 10 gallons left in the tank?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 180</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>How many miles has the car traveled if it has 2.5 gallons left in the tank?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 405</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>Choose the equation that represents the relationship between the distance the car has traveled in miles, \(d\),
    and the amount of gas left in the tank in gallons, \(x\)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>\(d=16(30-x)\)</li>
  <li>\(x=\frac{d-480}{-30}\)</li>
  <li>\(d=30(16-x)\)</li>
  <li>\(x=\frac{30}{d-480}\)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(d=30(16-x)\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>How many gallons are left in the tank when the car has traveled 90 miles?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 13</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
  <li>How many gallons are left in the tank when the car has traveled 246 miles?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 7.8</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="7">
  <li>Choose an equation
    that makes it easier to find the amount of gas left in the tank, \(x\), if we know the car has traveled \(d\) miles.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>\(d=16(30-x)\)</li>
  <li>\(x=\frac{d-480}{-30}\)</li>
  <li>\(d=30(16-x)\)</li>
  <li>\(x=\frac{30}{d-480}\)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=\frac{d-480}{-30}\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="8">
  <li>Noah was helping to collect the entry fees at his school's football game. Student entry costs $2.75 each and adult
    entry costs $5.25 each. By the end of the game, Diego had collected $281.25.
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Select two </strong>equations that could represent the relationship between the number of students, \(s\), the number of adults, \(a\), and the dollar amount collected at the game.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>\( 281.25 - 5.25a=2.75s \)</li>
  <li>\( a=53.57- \frac{2.75}{5.25}s \) (<em><strong>Note:</strong> 53.57 is rounded;
    it&rsquo;s </em><em>\(\frac{281.25}{5.25}\).</em>)</li>
  <li>\( 281.25-5.25s=a \)</li>
  <li>\( 281.25+2.75a=s \)</li>
  <li>\( 281.25+5.25s=a \)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong> \( 281.25 - 5.25a=2.75s \) and \(a=53.57- \frac{2.75}{5.25}s \)</p>
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="9">
    <li><strong>Select three</strong> equations that
      solve the formula \( 6x + 5y = 13 \) for \( y \).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>\(5.25a + 2.75s =  284.75\)</li>
  <li>\(284.75 - 5.25a = 2.75s\)</li>
  <li>\(284.75 - 5.25a = s\)</li>
  <li>\(284.75 - 2.75s = 5.25a\)</li>
  <li>\(284.75 - 2.75s = a\)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(5.25a + 2.75s =  284.75\), \(284.75 - 5.25a = 2.75s\), \(284.75 - 2.75s = 5.25a\)</p>
