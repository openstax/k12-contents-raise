<p>A car has a 16-gallon fuel tank. When driven on a highway, it has a gas mileage of 30 miles per gallon. The gas mileage (also called fuel efficiency) tells us the number of miles the car can travel for a particular amount of fuel (one gallon of gasoline, in this case). After filling the gas tank, the driver got on a highway and drove for a while.<br><br></p>
<p>&nbsp;1.a How many miles has the car traveled if it has the following
  amounts of gas left in the tank?<strong> Enter
    only integers.</strong></p>
