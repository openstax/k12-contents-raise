<p>Complete the following questions to practice the skills you have learned in this lesson.</p>
<p>A car has a 16-gallon fuel tank. When driven on a highway, it has a gas mileage of 30 miles per gallon. The gas mileage (also called fuel efficiency) tells us the number of miles the car can travel for a particular amount of fuel (one gallon of gasoline, in this case). After filling the gas tank, the driver got on a highway and drove for a while.<br><br></p>
<p>&nbsp;1. How many miles has the car traveled if it has the following
  amounts of gas left in the tank?<strong> Enter
    only integers.</strong></p>
<p>a. 15 gallons</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 30</p>
<p>b. 10 gallons<br><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;180<br><br></p>
<p>c. 2.5 gallons<br></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;405<br></p><br>
<p>2. Choose the equation that represents the relationship between the distance the
    car has traveled in miles,\(d\),&nbsp;and the amount of gas left in the tank in gallons, \(x\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="1" type="a">
  <li>\(d=16(30-x)\)</li>
  <li>\(x=\frac{d-480}{-30}\)</li>
  <li>\(d=30(16-x)\)</li>
  <li>\(x=\frac{30}{d-480}\)</li>
</ol><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>\(d=30(16-x)\)<br><br>
<p>3. How many gallons are
    left in the tank when the car has traveled the following distances on the
    highway? <strong>Enter only numbers.</strong></p>
<p>a.&nbsp;90 miles</p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;13<br><br>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;246miles<br><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;7.8<br><br></p>
<p>4.Choose an equation
    that makes it easier to find the amount of gas left in the tank, \(x\),&nbsp;if we know the car has traveled \(d\)&nbsp;miles. </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="1" type="a">
  <li>\(d=16(30-x)\)</li>
  <li>\(x=\frac{d-480}{-30}\)</li>
  <li>\(d=30(16-x)\)</li>
  <li>\(x=\frac{30}{d-480}\)</li>
</ol><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;<span>\(x=\frac{d-480}{-30}\)<br><br><br>
<p>5. Noah is helping collect the entry fees at his school&rsquo;s sports game. Student entry costs $2.75 each, and adult entry costs $5.25 each. At the end of the game, Noah collected $281.25.</p>
<p><strong>Select all </strong>equations that could represent the relationship between the number of students,&nbsp;\( s \), the number of adults, \(&nbsp;a&nbsp;\), and the dollar amount received at the game.</p>
