<p>In this lesson, students are introduced to the concept of roots above 2. They are also introduced to the concept that radicals can be written as terms with rational exponents.</p>
<p>Students may struggle with the properties for exponents when multiple properties are needed, for example, when negative exponents require an extra step.</p>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
