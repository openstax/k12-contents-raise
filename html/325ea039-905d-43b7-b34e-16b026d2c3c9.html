<p>A travel company uses a quadratic function to model the profit, in dollars, that it expects to earn from selling tickets to a river cruise at \(d\) dollars per person. The expression \(-d^2+100d-900\) defines this function.</p>
<p>Without graphing, find the price that would generate the maximum profit. Then, determine that maximum profit.</p>
