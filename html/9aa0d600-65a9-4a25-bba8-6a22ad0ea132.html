        <div class="os-raise-accordion-content">
            <p>Students begin the year by exploring linear equations, inequalities, and systems of linear equations and inequalities (Units 1 - 2). This builds on the content they learned in middle school mathematics. They use representations to model relationships and constraints but also reason with them abstractly. Students write, rearrange, evaluate, and solve equations and inequalities, explaining and validating their reasoning with increased precision. They then take these insights to a unit on two-variable statistics (Unit 3), where they extend their prior knowledge of scatter plots to determine lines of best fit. Students use correlation coefficients to assess linear models, interpret quantitative data, and distinguish correlation and causality. </p>
            <p>Next, students study functions and then deepen their ability to represent, interpret, and communicate about them‚Äîusing function notation, domain and range, average rate of change, and features of graphs (Unit 4). This exploration of the traits of linear functions is followed by exponential (Unit 5) and then quadratic functions in later units (Units 7 - 9). For each function type, students begin their investigation with real-world and mathematical contexts, look closely at the structural attributes of the function, and analyze how these attributes are expressed in different representations.
            </p>
            <p>Before investigating quadratic functions, however, students expand their understanding of applying operations to polynomial expressions (Unit 6). Students begin by reviewing their prior knowledge for how to simplify expressions containing exponents before extending the knowledge to include negative and rational exponents. Then, they engage in applying these skills within the mathematical context of multiplying and dividing polynomials. 
            </p>
            <p>The course ends with a close look at quadratic equations. Students extend their ability to use equations to model relationships and solve problems. They develop their capacity to write, transform, graph, and solve equations‚Äîby reasoning, rearranging equations into useful forms, and applying the quadratic formula. In solving quadratic equations, students encounter rational and irrational solutions; providing an opportunity to deepen their understanding of the real number system.
            </p>
            <p>In summary, students progress from linear to exponential to quadratic functions by exploring what makes the functions different. Students are asked to consider what happens when a pattern is generated from a specific value that is repeatedly added or subtracted (linear). Then, they engage in thinking about patterns that are generated from a specific value that is repeatedly multiplied or divided (exponential). Embedded in this process, students explore arithmetic and geometric sequences. Then, in later units, students are asked to consider patterns that adhere to a model that both increases and decreases over time (quadratic). Throughout each phase of learning, students encounter tables, equations, graphs, and verbal descriptions of real world and mathematical scenarios.
