<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the connections between a statement in function notation and the graph of the function.</li>
<li>Use function notation to efficiently represent a relationship between two quantities in a situation.</li>
<li>Use statements in function notation to sketch a graph of a function.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>4.3.1: Comparing Function Values</li>
<ul>
<li>In this activity, you compared function values given function notation and a graph.</li>
</ul>
<li>4.3.2: Writing Statements from Function Notation</li>
<ul>
<li>In this activity, you interpreted the meaning of function notation in a given situation and wrote a statement describing the situation.</li>
</ul>
<li>4.3.2: Self Check</li>
<li>4.3.3: Comparing Statements in Function Notation</li>
<ul>
<li>In this activity, you interpreted equations and inequalities involving function notation to compare which values were equal, larger, or smaller.</li>
</ul>
<li>4.3.3: Self Check</li>
<li>4.3.4: Using Function Notation with a Real-World Example</li>
<ul>
<li>In this activity, you looked at a real-world example of function notation where time was the input and the number of visitors to a website was the output.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
