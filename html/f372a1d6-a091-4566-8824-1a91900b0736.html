<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students will compute
  (using technology) and interpret the correlation coefficient for a bivariate,
  numerical data set. The work of this lesson connects to previous work because
  students learned how to read and interpret the correlation coefficient. The
  work of this lesson connects to upcoming work because students will learn to
  distinguish between correlation and causation.</p>
<p>When students use the value of the
  correlation coefficient to describe the relationship between two variables,
  they are looking for and making use of structure. To make sense of the
  relationship between variables, students reason abstractly and quantitatively.
  When students examine relationships to think about correlations, they also
  consider additional variables that might have an influence on any trends they
  see. Deciding which variables need to be included is a part of the process of
  modeling with mathematics.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Describe
    (orally and in writing) the strength and sign of the relationship between
    variables based on the correlation coefficient.</li>
  <li>Use
    technology to calculate the correlation coefficient and describe the strength
    of a relationship based on that value.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Describe
    the strength of a relationship between two variables.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Use
      technology to find the correlation coefficient and explain what the value tells you about a linear model in everyday language.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>
<p>Here are the instructional
  activities for the lesson:</p>
<ul>
  <li>3.5.0: Lesson Overview</li>
  <li>3.5.1: Using Bivariate Data in
    Context</li>
  <li>3.5.2: Interpreting&nbsp;the Strength of
    Linear Relationships
    <ul>
      <li>3.5.2: Self Check</li>
      <li>3.5.2: Additional Resources</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>3.5.3: Describing&nbsp;Relationships between Two
    Variables
    <ul>
      <li>3.5.3: Self Check</li>
      <li>3.5.3: Additional Resources</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>3.5.4: Interpreting the Correlation Coefficient</li>
</ul>
<p>Students will also
  complete a series of problems in the 3.5.5: Practice.</p>
  <h4>Required Materials</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Graphing technology</li>
  </ul>  
<h4>Required Preparation</h4>
<p>Students should have access to
  graphing technology that can compute the least-squares regression line and
  correlation coefficient from a set of bivariate data. Acquire devices that can
  run Desmos (recommended) or other graphing technology. It is ideal if each
  student has their own device. </p>
<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>
<p>During this lesson, it is
  important to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see
    throughout the lesson. Encourage students to look for these words and notice
    their use and meanings.</li>
  <li>Encourage students to use key vocabulary words in &ldquo;math talk&rdquo; and
    their written and oral explanations.</li>
  <li>Utilize a word wall. Sample cards
    are located here: <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/8ed3aa68763498713b44d3c2e537ffe61b4755f0" target="_blank">Mathematics Vocabulary Word Wall Cards</a></li>
