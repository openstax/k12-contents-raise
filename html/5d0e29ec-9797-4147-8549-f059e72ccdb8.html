<p>In this lesson, you will work with problems that show patterns of change and be able to describe the patterns in mathematical terms. A new term, quadratic, will be used to describe patterns with squared terms.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Describe how a pattern is growing. </li>
<li> Tell whether a pattern is growing linearly, exponentially, or quadratically. </li>
<li> Explain that an expression with a squared term is called quadratic. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li> 7.2.1: Squares in a Geometric Pattern </li>
<li> 7.2.2: Constant and Exponential Change </li>
<ul>
<li> 7.2.2: Self Check </li>
<li> 7.2.2: Additional Resources </li>
</ul>
<li> 7.2.3: Quadratic Expressions </li>

<li> 7.2.3: Self Check </li>
<li> 7.2.3: Additional Resources </li>
</ul>
<li> 7.2.4: Quadratic Relationships </li>
</ul>
<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll<strong> practice and review</strong>.</p>
