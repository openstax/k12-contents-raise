</ol>
<p>Answer the following questions about the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) if this equation is written in standard form, \(ax^2+bx+c=0\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
  <li>What is the value of \(a\)?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 2</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2" type="a">
  <li>What is the value of \(b\)?</li>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4" type="a">
  <li>Mai and Jada are solving the equation \(2x^2&minus;7x=15\) using the quadratic formula but found different solutions.</li>
  <p>Mai wrote:</p>
  <p>\(\begin{array}{l}
    x=\frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{(7)^{2}-4(2)(-15)}}{2(2)} \\
    x=\frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{49-(-120)}}{4} \\
    x=\frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{169}}{4} \\
    x=\frac{-7 \pm 13}{4} \\
    x=\frac{-7+13}{4}=\frac{6}{4}=\frac{3}{2} \\
    x=\frac{-7-13}{4}=\frac{-20}{4}=-5
    \end{array}\)</p>
  <p>Jada wrote:</p>
  <p>\(\begin{array}{l}
    x=\frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^{2}-4(2)(-15)}}{2(2)} \\
    x=\frac{7 \pm \sqrt{-49-(-120)}}{4} \\
    x=\frac{7 \pm \sqrt{71}}{4}
    \end{array}\)</p>
  <p>Who has the correct solution?</p>
</ol>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Mai</li>
  <li> Jada</li>
  <li> Both of them </li>
  <li> Neither one </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Neither one<br>
  Mai used 7 for \(b\) instead of -7. For \(b^2\) in the formula, Jada computed \(-7^2\) instead of \((-7)^2\), so she wrote -49 instead of 49.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>The equation \(h(t)=-16t^2+80t+64\) represents the height, in feet, of a potato \(t\) seconds after it was launched from a mechanical device.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
  <li>Choose the equation that would allow us to find the time the potato hits the ground.</li>
</ol>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> \(0=16t^2+80t+64\) </li>
  <li> \(0=-t^2-5t+4\) </li>
  <li> \(0=-16t^2+80t+64\) </li>
  <li> \(0= t^2-5t-4\) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(0=-16t^2+80t+64\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2" type="a">
  <li>Solve the equation without graphing and write it down. Enter your solution for the approximate time the potato hits the ground rounded to one decimal place.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 5.7</p>
<p>\(t \approx 5.7\). Using the quadratic formula, with \(a=-16\), \(b=80\), and \(c=64\), the potato hits the ground about 5.7 seconds after being launched. (The negative solution has no meaning in this situation.)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Priya found \(x=3\) and \(x=-1\) as solutions to \(3x^2&minus;6x&minus;9=0\).</li>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
  <li>If you check Priya's answer by substitution, is the answer correct?</li>
</ol>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Yes </li>
  <li> No </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes</p>
<p>Substituting both 3 and -1 for \(x\) in the original quadratic expression and then evaluating the expression gives a value of 0.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2" type="a">
  <li>If you check Priya's answer by graphing, is the answer correct?</li>
</ol>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Yes </li>
  <li> No </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes</p>
<p>Graphing the equation \(y=3x^2&minus;6x&minus;9\) shows \(x\)-intercepts at \((3,0)\) and \((-1,0)\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3" type="a">
  <li>If you check Priya's answer by using the quadratic formula, is the answer correct?</li>
</ol>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Yes </li>
  <li> No </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes</p>
<p>Substituting 3 for \(a\), -6 for \(b\), and -9 for \(c\) in the quadratic formula gives \(x=3\) and \(x=-1\).</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The frog landed \(\frac{4}{5}\) seconds after it jumped and was on the ground again. The height of the frog was 0 inches before it jumped.</p>

<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> The ball hits the ground \(\frac{1}{4}\) second after it is hit. </li>
  <li> The negative solution doesn't have meaning because a negative value for time doesn't make sense. </li>

  <li> The negative solution is a result of the bounce of the ball. </li>
  <li> The ball hits the ground \(-\frac{1}{4}\) second after it is hit. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The negative solution doesn't have meaning because a negative value for time doesn't make sense. The ball hits the ground 1 second after it is hit.</p>
