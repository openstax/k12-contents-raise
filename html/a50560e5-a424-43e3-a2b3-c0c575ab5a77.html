<h3>Unit Level Alignment</h3>
<p>Throughout each unit, a core sampling of <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4e39322c11e6d04360f2bc22cf16e43c9b80e05e" target="_blank">English Language Proficiency Standards</a> have been aligned to the identified Algebra 1 teaching strategies. The alignments are not intended to be all-inclusive. They are a sampling of ways to support English language learners within the math classroom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of an ELPS alignment table from Unit 1.&nbsp; Each lesson shows the specific ELPS standard and student expectations that have been met within that lesson.&nbsp; Remember that these are core samples, lessons may align to more ELPS, and each ELP could be aligned to more lessons.&nbsp; Each lesson has been aligned to at least three different ELPS domains. Opportunities to meet all five ELPS domains have been identified across the entire unit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this example, Lesson 1.1 has opportunities to support multiple learning strategies, listening, and writing. Meanwhile, Lesson 1.2 has been aligned with learning strategies, such as listening, speaking, and reading. Once you become familiar with how English language learners can be supported in the math classroom, you can pull these strategies for learning, listening, speaking, reading, and writing for any of the lessons.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Lesson Level Alignment</h4>
<p>As you begin a new lesson, you will see a table in the Teacher&rsquo;s Guide that provides a list of all of the sampling of ELPS. For this example from Lesson 1.2, the content in this lesson offers opportunities to scaffold the learning for learning strategies (ELPS 1), listening (ELPS 2), speaking (ELPS 3), and reading (ELPS 4). However, this lesson does not necessarily provide a straightforward opportunity to support writing (ELPS 5). You may have to pull from the routines that have been identified to differentiate the instruction to meet the needs of an ELL student who needs extra support in writing.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p> 
      <ul>
          <li>ELPS 1(E) internalize new basic and academic language by using and reusing it in meaningful ways in speaking and writing activities that build concept and language attainment</li>
      <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audio tape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
      <li>ELPS 3(B) expand and internalize initial English vocabulary by learning and using high-frequency English words necessary for identifying and describing people, places, and objects, by retelling simple stories and basic information represented or supported by pictures, and by learning and using routine language needed for classroom communication</li>
      <li>ELPS 3(D) speak using grade-level content area vocabulary in context to internalize new English words and build academic language proficiency</li>
      <li>ELPS 4(E) read linguistically accommodated content area material with a decreasing need for linguistic accommodations as more English is learned</li>
