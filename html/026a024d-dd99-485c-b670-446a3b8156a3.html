<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity enables students to continue to use the skills from previous lessons involving inequalities and graphing lines. Students have used a table of values previously to graph linear equations. In this lesson, students will use a table of values to graph the boundary line of an inequality by using the related equation. Students will solve inequalities in two variables using tables to graph the solutions.</p>
<p>The questions in this activity are written as a step-by-step guide to help students identify the key points to help them graph the inequality.</p>
<p>You may want to have students work in pairs so they can talk through the steps. You may need to remind students that the related equation of an inequality is the equation formed by replacing the inequality symbol with an equal sign.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Students will not use technology to solve the problems in this activity. However, you may want to allow them access to check their graphs. Explain that they will now be solving linear inequalities using tables.</p>

<p>For questions 1–5, use the following scenario to graph an inequality from a table:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Andre is making trail mix with dried fruit and mixed nuts. Dried fruit costs $3 per pound and mixed nuts cost $6 per pound. He wants to spend no more than $54 on the trail mix. The inequality \(y \leq −2x + 18\) represents the number of pounds of dried fruit, \(y\), he can buy for \(x\) pounds of nuts.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>The related equation \(y = -2x + 18\) represents the boundary line of the inequality. Complete the table of values to find points on the boundary line of the inequality.</li>

<br>
<br>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may make a table of values that provide solutions to the inequality. Emphasize that the table of values is used to find the boundary line, which requires identifying the related equation. Students may think they must choose a test point that is a solution of the inequality. Tell students they can use any point as a test point as long as it is not on the boundary line. Tell them \((0, 0)\) is often used because substituting \((0, 0)\) into the inequality makes for easy calculations. Tell them if their test point results in a true statement when substituted into the inequality, then the point is part of the solution. So they should shade the side of the line that contains that point. If the test point results in a false statement, shade the side of the line that does not contain the test point.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select student pairs to share their solutions. Have them show the work as they substitute the \(x\)-values into the related equation, plot the points, draw the line, and shade. At each step, have students explain how they decided whether the line should be dashed or solid. Ask how they chose the test point and ask if anyone else chose a different test point. Ask how they knew which side of the line to shade. Repeat this for the second scenario. Focus discussions on the process for graphing the solutions of the inequality.</p>

<p>Tables can be used to help you to write and solve inequalities in two variables.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1: </strong>Writing Inequalities in Two Variables Given A Set of Data in a Table</p>
<p>Write a linear inequality in two variables based on the given data:</p>
<table class="os-raise-skinnytable">

</table>
<br>
<p>Remember that for an inequality the points could be on the line, above the the line, or below the line.  The type of inequality will differ based on these conditions.</p>
<table class="os-raise-horizontaltable">
  <thead>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">On the line</th>
      <td> \(\leq\) or \(\geq\) </td>

</table>
<br>
<p>If you are given a set of possible points like the table above, there could be multiple lines that the data points could represent.  Let&rsquo;s figure out a few possibilities for this given set.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> Graph the points on a coordinate plane.</p>
<p><img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b68cb27bb14fbe6ed09f6a4b71d795de41b1ebf7"/></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Determine possible lines.</p>
<p>Remember that the dots can be on the line, but they all have to be either above or below to create an inequality.  If the line has points on both sides, then the line isn&rsquo;t a possibility.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try a few possibilities. We can start with the equation \(y=x\) to see if the points are above the line or below the line.</p>
<p><img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/60b97dc16d33f7b3edfcf5efbb96256bfadd96a7"/></p>
<p>The equation \(y=x\) cannot be a possibility because there are points above and below the line.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 -</strong> Adjust the slope or \(y\)-intercept</p>
<p>We can change the slope and the y-intercept to see how we can shift the line to be able to capture all the points. Let&rsquo;s move the line to below the \((3, -5)\) and \((-4, -6)\).  We can leave the slope as 1 and change the y-intercept to -7.</p>

<p>There is still one point below the line.  We could decrease the slope of the line to \(m=13\). </p>

<p>Now all of the points are above the line.  This means that the value of \(y\) is always greater than the \(x\) value.</p>
<p>So, one of the possible solutions could be \(y&gt; 13x-7\).</p>

<p>Graph the linear inequality \(y &lt; \frac{1}{2}x − 1\) using a table.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Create a table of values using the related equation \(y = \frac{1}{2}x − 1\) to identify points on the boundary line of the inequality.</p>
<table class="os-raise-skinnytable">

      <th scope="col">\(y\)</th>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Plot the points and sketch the boundary line.</p>
<p>If the inequality is \(\leq\) or \(\geq\), the boundary line is solid.</p>
<p>If the inequality is \(&lt;\) or \(&gt;\), the boundary line is dashed.</p>
<p>The inequality sign is \(&lt;\), so we draw a dashed line.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Test a point that is not on the boundary line. Is it a solution of the inequality?</p>
<p>Test \((0, 0)\) as it is not on the boundary line of the inequality.</p>
<p>\(y \overset?&lt; \frac{1}{2} x − 1\)</p>
<p>\((0) &lt; \frac{1}{2}(0) − 1\)</p>
<p>\(0 &lt; − 1\) is False.</p>
<p>So, \((0, 0)\) is not a solution.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Shade in one side of the boundary line.</p>
<p>If the test point is a solution, shade in the side that includes the point.</p>
<p>If the test point is not a solution, shade in the opposite side.</p>
<p>The test point \((0, 0)\) is not a solution, so shade in the side of the boundary line that does not include \((0, 0)\).</p>

<p>All points in the shaded region and not on the boundary line represent the solutions to \(y &lt; \frac{1}{2} x − 1\).</p>

<h5><strong>Solution:</strong></h5>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how to solve an inequality using a table:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Create a table of values using the related equation \(y = 2x + 3\) to identify points on the boundary line of the inequality.</p>
<table class="os-raise-skinnytable">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">\(x\)</th>
      <th scope="col">\(y\)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>−4</td>
      <td>−5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>−2</td>
      <td>−1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>7</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<br>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Plot the points and sketch the boundary line.</p>
<p>If the inequality is \(\leq\) or \(\geq\), the boundary line is solid.</p>
<p>If the inequality is \(&lt;\) or \(&gt;\), the boundary line is dashed.</p>
<p>The inequality sign is , so we draw a solid line.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Test a point that is not on the boundary line. Is it a solution of the inequality?</p>
<p>Test \((0, 0)\) as it is not on the boundary line of the inequality.</p>
<p>\(y  \leq 2x + 3\)</p>
<p>\((0)  \stackrel {?}{\leq} 2(0) + 3\)</p>
<p>\(0  \leq 3\) is True.</p>
<p>So, (0, 0) is a solution.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Shade in one side of the boundary line.</p>
<p>If the test point is a solution, shade in the side that includes the point.</p>
<p>If the test point is not a solution, shade in the opposite side.</p>
<p>The test point \((0, 0)\) is a solution, so shade in the side of the boundary line that includes \((0, 0)\).</p>

<p>All points in the shaded region and not on the boundary line represent the solutions to \(y  \leq 2x + 3\).</p>
