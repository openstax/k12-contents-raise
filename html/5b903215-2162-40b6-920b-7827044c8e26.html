  <h4>Activity (40 minutes)</h4>


    <p>The mathematical purpose of this
      activity is for students to collect, summarize, interpret, and draw
      conclusions from bivariate data using scatter plots, best fit lines,
      residuals and correlation coefficients.</p>
    <p>Students could examine number of
      penalties (like number of flags thrown against a football team) or
      severity of penalties (like penalty yards assessed against a football
      team).</p>
    <p>Making graphing technology
      available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools
      strategically (TEKS 1C and 1D). By selecting which variables to use for their model
      and finding additional data to support a claim, students are modeling
      with mathematics (TEKS 1C and 1D).</p>

  <h3>Launch</h3>
  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>Arrange students in groups of 2 to 4. </li>
      <li>
        Give students 2 minutes to work through the first question, then pause for a whole-group discussion. Tell students, "Data is often kept about fouls in basketball, flags in football, or penalty box minutes in
        hockey." If using the blackline master, then distribute it to students and tell them to begin questions 2 and 3.
       If you are not using the blackline master, then tell students to use the internet to find data
      about fouls, flags, penalties, or other similar data about rules violations and sports results. </li>
      <li>
        Ask them to record two questions for the data that they research that are similar to questions 2 and 3. Then ask
        them to answer their questions using mathematical work.

  <h4>Student Activity</h4>

    <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
      <li>Before
        researching data, do you think the number of penalties a team gets in a
        season is correlated to the number of wins the team gets in that
        season? Do you think it is a positive or negative relationship? Do you
        think the relationship is weak or strong? Be prepared to show your reasoning.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Is there a relationship
        between the number of penalties a team gets in a season and the number
        of wins in that season? Show any mathematical work that leads to your
        answer.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Do penalties cause a change in wins or wins cause a change in penalties or neither? Be prepared to show your reasoning.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>

  <h3>Student Response</h3>

    <p>Answers will vary but here are some samples.</p>
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
      <li>I
        think there will be a weak, negative relationship. Penalties usually
        come with ways that put the team at a disadvantage, but not a very
        severe one, so I think that more penalties will lead to fewer wins, but
        not a strong relationship.</li>
      <li>Based on the scatter plot and correlation coefficient, there is a very weak (\( r = 0.19 \)), positive relationship.

      </li>
      <li>I think neither of these variables causes the other to change. Most
        likely, a very good team may feel they have the ability to give up a
        few penalties and still win, so they don't worry as much about getting
        penalized.</li>
    </ol>

  <h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>
    <p>Students may struggle with finding a method to determine the presence
      of a relationship. Ask students, "What data could you collect to begin
      answering the question? What representations could you create with that
      data to help illustrate a relationship?"</p>

  <h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>

    <p>The purpose of this discussion is for students to communicate how they used mathematics to justify their findings. If students are able to research their own data, tell the groups to create a visual display to present their findings. Some questions for discussion are listed here:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"If there is a negative correlation, do you think the penalties
        would cause fewer wins?" (Although it may be part of the cause, it is
        generally not the main reason a team loses several games.)</li>
      <li>"Were there any interesting data points you would like to research
        more about?" (Some points were very far away from the rest of the data
        and might be interesting to look at more closely.)</li>
      <li>"How did you reach a conclusion? Be prepared to show your reasoning." (I
        created a scatter plot from data that I collected. I then plotted the
        residuals to verify that a linear model would be appropriate. I computed
        a line of best fit and a correlation coefficient and found that there
        was a weak relationship between penalties and wins because the
        correlation coefficient was between 0 and 0.5.)</li>
    </ul>



  <h3>Project Synthesis</h3>

    <p><strong>Use the following questions to lead a class discussion.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>"What did you find important, challenging, or otherwise notable
        about today's lesson?" (It was really interesting to collect data to
        answer a question. I really felt like I was figuring something out.)</li>
      <li>"What mathematical work from this unit did you use in today's
        activity?" (I used scatter plots, lines of best fit, and the correlation
        coefficient. I also had to determine whether or not the two variables
        showed a causal relationship.)</li>
      <li>"How might the mathematical tools that you have learned in this
        unit help you outside of mathematics class?" (I could use these tools to
        think about graphs or claims that I see being made in the media. It
        would help me to determine what to believe and what not to believe.)</li>
    </ul>
