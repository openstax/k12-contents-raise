<p dir="ltr"></p><div><h3>Activity</h3>
<div>
<p>40 minutes</p>
<p>The mathematical purpose of this
 activity is for students to collect, summarize, interpret, and draw 
conclusions from bivariate data using scatter plots, best fit lines, 
residuals and correlation coefficients.</p>
<p>Students could examine number of
 penalties (like number of flags thrown against a football team) or 
severity of penalties (like penalty yards assessed against a football 
team).</p>
<p>Making graphing technology 
available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools 
strategically (MP5). By selecting which variables to use for their model
 and finding additional data to support a claim, students are modeling 
with mathematics (MP4).</p>
</div>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<div>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2 
to 4. Give students 2 minutes to work through the first question, then 
pause for a whole-group discussion. Tell students, "Data is often kept 
about fouls in basketball, flags in football, or penalty box minutes in 
hockey." If using the blackline master, then distribute it to students 
and tell them to begin questions 2 and 3. If you are not using the 
blackline master, then tell students to use the internet to find data 
about fouls, flags, penalties, or other similar data about rules 
violations and sports results. Ask them to record two questions for the 
data that they research that are similar to questions 2 and 3. Then ask 
them to answer their questions using mathematical work.</p>
<p>A blackline master is included 
with data for hockey and football if students do not have access to 
technology to find their own data.</p>
<h4>Support for Students with Disabilities</h4>
<div>
<em>Engagement: Develop Effort and Persistence.</em>
 Encourage and support opportunities for peer interactions. Display 
sentence frames to support student conversation such as: "I predict 
_____ because . . .", "We will need to know . . .", "Why did you . . 
.?", "I agree/disagree because . . ."<br><em>Supports accessibility for: Language; Social-emotional skills</em></div><div><em><br></em>

<h3>Student Facing Statement</h3>
<div>
<ol><li>Before
 researching data, do you think the number of penalties a team gets in a
 season is correlated to the number of wins the team gets in that 
season? Do you think it is a positive or negative relationship? Do you 
think the relationship is weak or strong? Explain your reasoning.
</li>
<li>Is there a relationship 
between the number of penalties a team gets in a season and the number 
of wins in that season? Show any mathematical work that leads to your 
answer.
</li>
<li>Do penalties cause a change in wins or wins cause a change in penalties or neither? Explain your reasoning.
</li>
</ol></div>
<h3>Student Response</h3>
<div>
<p>Sample response:</p>
<ol><li>I
 think there will be a weak, negative relationship. Penalties usually 
come with ways that put the team at a disadvantage, but not a very 
severe one, so I think that more penalties will lead to fewer wins, but 
not a strong relationship.</li>
<li>
<div><img alt="Scatter plot, number of wins, penalty minutes per game. &nbsp;" height="244" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/im-ims-export/SkniynJNDJVmRvJomC8kFczD" width="227"></div>
	Based on the scatter plot and correlation coefficient, there is a very weak (\( r = 0.19 \)), positive relationship.</li>
<li>I think neither of these variables causes the other to change. Most
 likely, a very good team may feel they have the ability to give up a 
few penalties and still win, so they don't worry as much about getting 
penalized.</li>
</ol></div>
<h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>
<div>
<p>Students may struggle with finding a method to determine the presence
 of a relationship. Ask students, "What data could you collect to begin 
answering the question? What representations could you create with that 
data to help illustrate a relationship?"</p>
</div>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<div>
<p>The purpose of this discussion is for students to communicate how they used mathematics to justify their findings.</p>
<p>If students are able to research their own data, tell the groups to 
create a visual display to present their findings. Some questions for 
discussion are listed here:</p>
<ul><li>"If there is a negative correlation, do you think the penalties 
would cause fewer wins?" (Although it may be part of the cause, it is 
generally not the main reason a team loses several games.)</li>
<li>"Were there any interesting data points you would like to research 
more about?" (Some points were very far away from the rest of the data 
and might be interesting to look at more closely.)</li>
<li>"How did you reach a conclusion? Explain your reasoning." (I 
created a scatter plot from data that I collected. I then plotted the 
residuals to verify that a linear model would be appropriate. I computed
 a line of best fit and a correlation coefficient and found that there 
was a weak relationship between penalties and wins because the 
correlation coefficient was between 0 and 0.5.)</li>
</ul></div>

<h2>Lesson Synthesis</h2>
<div>
<p>Here are some questions for discussion.</p>
<ul><li>"What did you find important, challenging, or otherwise notable 
about today's lesson?" (It was really interesting to collect data to 
answer a question. I really felt like I was figuring something out.)</li>
<li>"What mathematical work from this unit did you use in today's 
activity?" (I used scatter plots, lines of best fit, and the correlation
 coefficient. I also had to determine whether or not the two variables 
showed a causal relationship.)</li>
<li>"How might the mathematical tools that you have learned in this 
unit help you outside of mathematics class?" (I could use these tools to
 think about graphs or claims that I see being made in the media. It 
would help me to determine what to believe and what not to believe.)</li>
