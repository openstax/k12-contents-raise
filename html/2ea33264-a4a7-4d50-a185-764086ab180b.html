<p>Which car traveled slower?</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
  <li>
    Car A
  </li>
  <li>
    Car B
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Car A traveled slower because Car B was a further distance in the same amount of time as car A:</p>

<p>For #6-7, use this situation and function:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The daily cost to the manufacturing company is modeled by the function&nbsp;</p>
