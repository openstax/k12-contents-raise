<p><strong><em>Students will complete the following questions to practice the skills they have learned in this lesson.</em></strong></p>
<p>1. The graphs show the distance,d, traveled by two cars, A and B, over time,t. Distance is measured in miles and time is measured in hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="Lines A and B on coordinate plane." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/d71d8dc6f83c6c24781699b463b8e5790cc17f77"></p>
<p>Which car traveled slower?</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
  <li>
    Car A
  </li>
  <li>
    Car B
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>Car A traveled slower because Car B was a further distance in the same amount of time as car A:</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>An empty 20-gallon water tank is filled at a constant rate for 3 minutes until it is half full. Then, it is emptied at a constant rate for 3 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Graph 3</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>A full 10-gallon water tank is drained for 30 seconds, until it is half full. Afterwards, it gets refilled.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Graph 1</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>A 2,000-gallon water tank starts out empty. It is being filled for 5 hours, slowly at first, and faster later.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Graph 2</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>An empty 100-gallon water tank is filled in 50 minutes. Then, a dog jumps in and splashes around for 10 minutes, letting 7 gallons of water out. The tank is refilled afterwards.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>Graph 4</p>
<p>For #6-7, use this situation and function:</p>
<p>The daily cost to the manufacturing company is modeled by the function&nbsp;</p>
<p>C(x)=7.25x+2500 where C(x) is the total daily cost and x is the number of items manufactured.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
  <li>What is C(0)?&nbsp; Enter an integer only. No commas or symbols.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> 2500&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="7">
  <li>What does C(0) mean in the context of the situation?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>Cost before any items are manufactured</p>
