      <h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>Throughout this lesson, students will use a context that involves two variables&mdash;the number of games and the number of rides at an amusement park&mdash;and a budgetary constraint. This warm-up prompts students to interpret and make sense of some equations in context, familiarizing them with the quantities and relationships. Later in the lesson, students will dig deeper into what the parameters and graphs of the equations reveal. </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Launch</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Give students a couple of minutes of quiet work time and then another minute to share their response with their partner. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>
        <p>Desmos activities are different from the graphing calculator application because they lead students through one or more interactive tasks. As students progress through the activity, teachers may use the Teacher Dashboard to monitor student responses and use them for whole group discussion. Activities may also be set to identify student responses that are correct or incorrect.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 1 - </strong></p>If you have not already created a free account, access <a href="https://teacher.desmos.com/">teacher.desmos.com</a> and create your account. Search for the activity using the title above or this <a href="https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/647b6b3a06039e1be06ce5ef">link</a>.
        <p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Step 2- Once you have selected the activity, hit the <strong>Assign</strong> button and set up a <strong>Single Session Code</strong>. If you have experience with Desmos activities and have already set up your classes within the program, you may prefer to assign the activity to your classes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3 - </strong> Once you have created your code, scroll down to <strong>Activity Sessions</strong> and select <strong>View Dashboard</strong>. You can either share the invitation link or the 6-letter code for students to join on <a href="https://teacher.desmos.com/">teacher.desmos.com</a></p>
        <br>
        <p> Be sure to review all parts of the activity prior to using it with students to permit the identification of locations where students may struggle or key concepts you wish to highlight.

        <p>Jada has <span>$</span>20 to spend on games and rides at a carnival. Games cost <span>$</span>1 each, and rides are <span>$</span>2 each.</p>

          <li>Equation C</li>
          <li>Compare your answer:

              <li>A: The combined number of games and rides that Jada enjoys is 20.</li>
              <li>B: Jada spends <span>$</span>20 on games and rides, where games are <span>$</span>2 each and rides are <span>$</span>1 each.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

      <h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>Invite students to share their interpretations of the equations.</p>
        <p>Most students are likely to associate the 20 in the equation with the <span>$</span>20 that Jada has, but some students may interpret it to mean the combined number of games and rides Jada enjoys. (This is especially natural to do for <span class="math math-repaired">\( x+y=20 \)</span>.) If this interpretation comes up, acknowledge that it is valid. </p>
