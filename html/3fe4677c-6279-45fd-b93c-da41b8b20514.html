      <h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>Throughout this lesson, students will use a context that involves two variables&mdash;the number of games and the number of rides at an amusement park&mdash;and a budgetary constraint. This warm-up prompts students to interpret and make sense of some equations in context, familiarizing them with the quantities and relationships. Later in the lesson, students will dig deeper into what the parameters and graphs of the equations reveal. </p>
      </div>
      <h3>Launch</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Give students a couple of minutes of quiet work time and then another minute to share their response with their partner. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>
        <p>Desmos activities are different from the graphing calculator application because they lead students through one or more interactive tasks. As students progress through the activity, teachers may use the Teacher Dashboard to monitor student responses and use them for whole group discussion. Activities may also be set to identify student responses that are correct or incorrect.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 1 - </strong>If you have not already created a free account, access <a href="https://teacher.desmos.com/">teacher.desmos.com</a> and create your account. Search for the activity using the title above or this <a href="https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/647b6b3a06039e1be06ce5ef">link</a>.
        <p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Once you have selected the activity, hit the <strong>Assign</strong> button and set up a <strong>Single Session Code</strong>. If you have experience with Desmos activities and have already set up your classes within the program, you may prefer to assign the activity to your classes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3 - </strong> Once you have created your code, scroll down to <strong>Activity Sessions</strong> and select <strong>View Dashboard</strong>. You can either share the invitation link or the 6-letter code for students to join on <a href="https://teacher.desmos.com/">teacher.desmos.com</a></p>
        <p> Be sure to review all parts of the activity prior to using it with students topermit the identification of locations where students may struggle or key concepts you wish to highlight.

      <h4>Student Activity</h4>
      <div class="body">
        <p>Jada has $20 to spend on games and rides at a carnival</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Games cost $1 each.</li>
          <li>Rides are $2 each.</li>
        </ul>  
        <p>Screen 1 - If Jada only plays games, how many games can she play?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong>If Jada only spends her money to play games, then she can play 20 games.</p>
        <p>Screen 2 - If Jada only goes on rides, how many can she ride?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong>If Jada only spends her money to go on rides, then she can ride 10 times.</p>
        <p>Screen 3 - Create a table of values that represents the number of games and rides in which Jada can participate for $20. </p>

        <p>Screen 4 - Write a sentence that describes the relationship between the amount of money that Jada spends at the carnival and the number of games and the number of rides in which she participates. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample: Twenty dollars equals the sum of the number of games times $1 and the number of games times $2.  </p>
        <p>Screen 5 - Which equation represents the relationship between the number of games, \(x\), and the number of rides, \(y\), that Jada could do if she spends all $20?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>\(x + y = 20\)</li>
          <li>\(2x + y = 20\)</li>
          <li>\(x + 2y = 20\)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong>\(x + 2y = 20\)</p>
        <p>Screen 6 - Let \(x\) represent the number of games she plays and \(y\) represent the number of rides that she goes on. Describe what the equation \(x + y = 20 could\) mean in this situation. </p>
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Your answer may vary, but here are some samples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Jada spends $20 on games and rides that cost $1 each.</li>
          <li>The combined number of games and rides that Jada enjoys is 20.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Screen 7 - Let \(x\) represent the number of games she plays and y represent the number of rides that she goes on. Describe what the equation \(2x + y = 20\) could mean in this situation. </p>
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample: Jada spends $20 on games and rides, where games cost $2 each and rides are $1 each. </p>
