<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students find the slope of a line that goes through two given points when given the points as coordinates, on a graph, or in a table. In 4.8 students find the average rate of change over an interval. By using the slope formula to a slope using two coordinate pairs, students are focusing on the mechanics of computing the value and can focus more fully on the context and meaning in the problems in lesson 4.8.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Ask students to share what the slope of a line means. Facilitate the discussion to the types of slope, positive, negative, zero, or no slope and what those lines look like on a graph. See &ldquo;Support for English Language Learners&rdquo; box for more enrichment in the discussion. Recall that, to find slope, students must find the change in \(y\) values over the change in \(x\) values; this is also represented in the slope formula, \(m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\).</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Recall that the slope of a line is the rate of change of the linear function. On the graph, it is the steepness of the line.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(\frac{-3}{3}=-1\)</p>
<br>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>When finding slope, students often write the change in \(x\) over the change in \(y\). Continue to reinforce the correct order and relate it back to the graph problems with rise over run.</p>
<br>
<div class="os-raise-graybox"><h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<em>Representing: MLR8 Discussion Supports</em><br>
<p>As students discuss finding slope, encourage students to use the words slope and change in \(y\) over change in \(x\); also numerator and denominator, as more formal mathematical language. Students may be more comfortable with informal language such as up and down, top and bottom, and rise over run. Students can create an icon or environmental print to remember that the difference in \(y\) is in the numerator and difference in \(x\) is in the denominator.</p>
<p>When discussing slope, have students use Total Physical Response (TPR) to associated the directions of lines with the types of slope. Have students all face the same direction and make their arms create a positive slope, negative slope, no slope and zero slope.</p>
<p>Next, have students create a &ldquo;ski hill&rdquo; or &ldquo;sled hill&rdquo; with a story. This could be with an illustration and verbal story or an illustration with a written story to practice goals appropriate to the student. This could also be done as a whole class or small group.Example story: As student ride up the ski lift (positive slope), then cross country to the start of the slope (zero slope), then go down the hill (negative slope). Then as they gain confidence, they will try harder mountains. They go to a double black diamond that looks like it is straight up and down. They say &ldquo;oh NO,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not going down that mountain. It has NO slope.</p>
<p>Using TPR and creating stories like this will help students reinforce what slope is when they see the word &ldquo;slope&rdquo; and different types of slope in print that are regularly used in this lesson and the lessons that follow. This will help them as they explain their graphs and later their equations of lines.<br>

<br>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>The purpose of the discussion is to clarify the meaning of slopes. Select students to share their solutions, including how they arrived at the value. Ask students:</p>
<ul>
  <li> &ldquo;If line A has a slope of 2 and line B has a slope of 5, describe how the graphs of these two lines would look different.&rdquo; (Line B would be more steep. That is, for every increase of 1 in the horizontal direction, the line rises 5 units in the vertical direction for line B, while line A only rises 2 units. </li>
  <ul>
    <li aria-level="2"> Utilizing the TPR used in the &ldquo;Support for English Language Learners,&rdquo; students could be asked to use their arms to compare a slope of 2 versus the slope of 5. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> &ldquo;What does it mean for the graph of a line when it has a negative slope?&rdquo; (It means the graph is decreasing. In other words, for every increase of 1 in the horizontal direction, the line falls some amount in the vertical direction.) </li>
  <ul>
    <li aria-level="2"> Again, using TPR, ask students how they would change their arms to represent a negative slope to help make the connection. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> &ldquo;Can you think of a situation that connects two variables with a negative slope?&rdquo; (The distance to home as a function of time when someone is walking home.) </li>
</ul>
