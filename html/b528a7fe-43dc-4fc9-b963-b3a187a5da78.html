<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm up reviews perfect squares and square roots and begins to elicit the idea of higher powers and the nth root.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<ol>
  <li> What is the value of \(4 \times 4\)? <br><br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> 16
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li> What is the value of \(4^2\)? <br><br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> 16
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li> Using what you know about roots, what is the value of \(\sqrt{16}\)? <br><br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> 4
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li> Talk to a partner. How can you prove \(\sqrt[2]{4^2}\;=\;4\)? <br><br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> Since \(4^2\;=\;4\;\cdot\;4\;=\;16\) and \(\sqrt{16}\;=\;4\), \(\sqrt[2]{4^2}\;=\;4\).<br>
    <p>Notice that the root and exponents are the same and simplify to leave the integer only.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li> Talk to a partner. What do you think the answer to \(\sqrt[5]{4^5}\) would be? <br><br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(\sqrt[5]{4^5}\;=\;4\)
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>If time allows, continue to give more examples where the exponent and index of the root are the same. Ask students to come up with a rule or pattern.</p>
