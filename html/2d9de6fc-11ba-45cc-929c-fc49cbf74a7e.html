<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:<br></p>
<ul>
  <li>Explain &ldquo;the solution to a system of linear equations&rdquo; and how the solution is represented graphically.</li>
  <li>Refer to two equations as a system of equations.</li>
  <li>Use tables and graphs to solve systems of equations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities </strong>that helped you reach those goals: <br></p>
<ul>
  <li>2.1.1: Understanding Constraints and Values<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you analyzed different combinations of trail mix to determine if they met a certain cost constraint. You learned that writing an equation is one way to check if these values meet the constraint.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>2.1.2: Writing and Graphing Equations<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you wrote equations to represent two different constraints covering the cost and amount of trail mix. These equations represent a system of linear equations. Then you graphed the system of equations and used the graph to complete a table. These are important methods when solving a system of equations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>2.1.2: Self Check </li>
  <li>2.1.2: Additional Resources </li>
</ul>
<li>2.1.3: Meeting Constraints<ul>
    <li>In this activity, you analyzed a situation and found a pair of values that met two different constraints in that situation. You were then able to explain your reasoning in how you solved the systems of equations.</li>
  </ul>

<li>2.1.3: Self Check </li>
<li>2.1.3: Additional Resources </li>

<li>2.1.4: Exploring a System of Equations<ul>
    <li>In this activity, you solved a system of equations using your preferred method of choice. Systems of equations can be solved by graphing, algebraically, guessing and checking, or using tables.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<p><br>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:<br></p>
