    <div class="os-raise-accordion-content">
      <p>What is vertical alignment? You may be familiar with aligning your math lesson to a set of standards. But what does TEA mean when they discuss the importance of vertical alignment? Vertical alignment documents the progression of learning from grade level to grade level.</p>
      <p>Students learn many different sets of knowledge and skills related to mathematics that build upon each other. Understanding this progression of learning across the curriculum continuum provides teachers and administrators the ability to better support mathematical conceptual and skill-based development.</p>
      <p>As a teacher, understanding the TEKS mathematical vertical alignment will help you better understand what your students have already mastered and how what you are teaching them will be critical for mastery in future learning opportunities.</p>
      <p>For Algebra I teachers, we recommend using the Texas Education Agency&rsquo;s <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c1d455b65dade9bf6cba34312c3742132cb76c48" target="_blank">TEKS Vertical Alignment Chart Grades 5 through Algebra 1 and Algebra 2</a>. To understand how to read and use the Vertical Alignment chart, watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1xp5nd44Eg;&rel=0" target="_blank">introductory video</a>.</p>
      <p>Watch this video walkthrough of using the vertical alignment to better understand your students&rsquo; readiness for learning new content in each unit of RAISE.</p>
