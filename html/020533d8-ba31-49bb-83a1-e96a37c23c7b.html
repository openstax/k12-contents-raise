<h3>Student Readiness for English Language Proficiency Standards (ELPS)</h3>

<p>Throughout each unit, we have provided a core sampling of teaching strategies that align to the <a href="https://www.esc4.net/users/0001/docs2/122-ELPS.pdf">English Language Proficiency Standards</a>. The alignments are not intended to be all inclusive. They are to demonstrate the variety of ways that you can support English language learners in the math classroom. Each lesson will have at least three different domains aligned and the entire until will have all five ELPS domains aligned. You can pull these strategies for learning, listening, speaking, reading, and writing for any of the lessons. To see examples of teaching routines for each standard, please view the Teacher Guide for Course Level Resources.</p>

<p>Support for English Language Learners</p>

<p>To accomplish these unit-level learning goals, students will complete the following lessons and activities.</p>
