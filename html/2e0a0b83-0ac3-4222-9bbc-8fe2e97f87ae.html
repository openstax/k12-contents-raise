<p>Ask students to discuss with a partner: &ldquo;How are arithmetic and geometric sequences alike and different?&rdquo; After they have had a few minutes to discuss, ask several students to share the things that came up. Some things to highlight:</p>
<ul>
<li>
    They are both types of sequences. That is, they are both lists of numbers.
  </li>
<li>
    To get from one term to the next for both arithmetic and geometric sequences, you &ldquo;do the same thing each time.&rdquo;</li>
<li>
    For geometric sequences, you always multiply by the same number to get the next term. For arithmetic sequences, you always add the same number to get the next term.
  </li>
<li>
    Geometric sequences have growth factors (the quotient of any term and the previous term), but arithmetic sequences have a constant rate of change (the difference of any term and the previous term).
  </li>
</ul>
