<p>Ask students to discuss with a partner: &ldquo;How are arithmetic and geometric sequences alike and different?&rdquo; After they have had a few minutes to discuss, ask several students to share the things that came up. Some things to highlight:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    They are both types of sequences. That is, they are both lists of numbers.
  </li>
  <li>
    To get from one term to the next for both arithmetic and geometric sequences, you &ldquo;do the same thing each time.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>
    For geometric sequences, you always multiply by the same number to get the next term. For arithmetic sequences, you always add the same number to get the next term.
  </li>
  <li>
    Geometric sequences have growth factors (the quotient of any term and the previous term), but arithmetic sequences have a constant rate of change (the difference of any term and the previous term).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
