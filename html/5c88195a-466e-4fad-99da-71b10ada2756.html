<p>Here is a graph that represents the height of a baseball, \(h\), in feet as a function of time, \(t\), in seconds after it was hit by Player A.</p>
<p><img alt="Horizontal axis, time in seconds. Vertical axis, height in feet. Parabola, opens down, x intercepts at about -0.62 and about 5.12, vertex = 2 point 5 comma 105." height="213" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/719350de85b749cac26a9fe76d9d4d9989353b8a" width="318"></p>
<p>The function \(g\) defined by \(g(t)=(-16t&minus;1)(t&minus;4)\) also represents the height in feet of a baseball \(t\) seconds after it was hit by Player B. Without graphing function \(g\), answer the following questions and explain or show how you know.</p>

    <div class="os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response">
      <p>Correct! Player A's baseball stayed in flight longer. The zeros of function \(g\) are 4 and \(-\frac{1}{16}\). The negative zero doesn't have any meaning in this situation. A zero in this situation means the time when the baseball has a height of 0 (or when it hits the ground). For Player B, this happened when \(t=4\) or 4 seconds after it was hit. Player A's baseball hit the ground a little over 5 seconds after it was hit.</p>

    <div class="os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response">
      <p>Correct! Player A's baseball reached a greater maximum height. From the graph for Player A, it looks like the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex is around 105 feet. For Player B, the vertex of the graph has a \(t\)-coordinate of about 2 (halfway between \(\frac{-1}{16}\) and 4). We can find g(2) to estimate the height at that point. \(g(2)=(-16(2)&minus;1)(2&minus;4)=(-33)(-2)=66\), so the highest point of Player B's baseball was around 66 feet.</p>
