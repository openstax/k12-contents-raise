<h3>Activity (25 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students encounter quadratic equations that are slightly more complex than those in the warm up.
</p>
<p>Encourage students to first isolate the squared variable algebraically. Then have them apply the square root
  property, while reinforcing that this yields two solutions.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Introduce the square root property as shown at the top of the activity. Emphasize that when using the property to
  solve an equation, there is always a positive and a negative square root.</p>
<p>Consider arranging students in groups of two and asking them to work quietly for a few minutes before discussing
  their thinking with a partner.</p>

<div class="os-raise-graybox">
  <p><em>Representing, Conversing: MLR7 Compare and Connect</em>. Use this routine to prepare students for the
    whole-class
    discussion. At the appropriate time, invite student pairs to create a visual display of their strategies for solving
    the quadratic equations. Allow students time to quietly circulate and analyze the strategies in at least two other
    visual displays in the room. Give students quiet think time to consider what is the same and what is different about
    their solution strategies. Next, ask students to return to their partner and discuss what they noticed. Listen for
    and amplify observations that highlight advantages and disadvantages to each method. This will help students make
    connections between different strategies for solving quadratic equations.

  <p><em>Engagement: Develop Effort and Persistence</em>. Chunk this task into manageable parts for students who benefit
    from
    support with organizational skills in problem solving. For example, cut problems into four separate slips and have
    students obtain the new problem only after finishing the last. Provide students four copies of a graphic organizer
    with two sectionsâ€”one for work, and another for notes/explanations. Invite students to record their work for each
    problem on its own paper. When presenting multiple strategies and approaches, encourage students to use the space
    for notes/explanations to record explanations and alternate strategies.

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>A whole number that has two factors that are equal to each other is called a perfect square. Those equal factors that
  multiply to be the number are called the <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0"
    data-store="glossary-tooltip">square root of a number</span>. For instance, 3 is a square root of 9 because 3 * 3 =
  9.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the square root property.</p>
<br>
<div class="os-raise-graybox">
  <p class="os-raise-text-bold">SQUARE ROOT PROPERTY</p>
  <p>If \(x^2 = k\), then</p>
  <p class="os-raise-noindent">\(x=\sqrt{k} \quad \text { and } \quad x=-\sqrt{k} \rightarrow x=\pm \sqrt{k}\).</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>Each of these equations has two solutions. Use your knowledge of square roots and the square root property. What are
  the solutions? Explain or show your reasoning.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>\(n^2 + 4=404\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(n=20\) and \(n=-20\)</p>
<p>If \(n^2 + 4 = 404\), then \(n^2 = 400\).<br>
  Using the square root property, \(n= \pm \sqrt{400}\).<br>
  Therefore, \(n=20\) and \(n=-20\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>\(432=3n^2\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(n=12\) and \(n=-12\)</p>
<p>Divide each side of the equation by 3.<br>
  \(n^2=144\)<br>
  Using the square root property, \(n= \pm \sqrt{144}\).<br>
  Therefore, \(n=12\) and \(n=-12\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>\(\frac{n^2}{5}&minus;20=0\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(n=10\) and \(n=-10\)</p>
<p>Add 20 to each side of the equation.<br>
  Then multiply each side of the equation by 5.<br>
  \(n^2 = 100\)<br>
  Using the square root property, \(n= \pm \sqrt{100}\).<br>
  Therefore, \(n=10\) and \(n=-10\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>\(2n^2&minus;7=65\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(n=6\) and \(n=-6\)</p>
<p>Add 7 to each side of the equation.<br>
  Divide each side of the equation by 2.<br>
  \(n^2=36\)<br>
  Using the square root property, \(n= \pm \sqrt{36}\).<br>
  Therefore, \(n=6\) and \(n=-6\).</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Ask students to explain in their own words why the square root property is true. Use an example such as \(x^2=64\) to
  help explain. Ask a student to complete the following sentence:</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">If \(x^2=64\), then ______________________.</p>
<p>Sample answers:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> If \(x^2=64\), then \(x = \sqrt{64}\) and \(x =- \sqrt{64}\). </li>
  <li> If \(x^2=64\), then \(x= \pm \sqrt{64}\). </li>
  <li> If \(x^2=64\), then \(x=8\) and \(x=-8\). </li>
</ul>
<p>Emphasize that there are two solutions that make the equation true, a positive square root and a negative square
  root.</p>

<h4>Using the Square Root Property to Solve Quadratic Equations </h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look again at the square root property.</p>
<br>
<div class="os-raise-graybox">
  <p class="os-raise-text-bold">SQUARE ROOT PROPERTY</p>
  <p>If \(x^2=k\), then</p>
  <p class="os-raise-noindent">\(x=\sqrt{k} \quad \text { and } \quad x=-\sqrt{k} \rightarrow x=\pm \sqrt{k}\).</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>Notice that the square root property gives two solutions to an equation of the form \(x^2=k\), the principal square
  root of \(k\) and its opposite. We could also write the solution as \(x= \pm \sqrt{k}\). We read this as \(x\) equals
  positive and negative the square root of \(k\).</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 1</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s solve \(x^2= 9\) using the square root property.</p>
<p>\(x^2=9\)</p>
<p>\(x= \pm \sqrt{9}\)</p>
<p>\(x= \pm 3\)</p>
<p>So, \(x=3\) and \(x=-3\).</p>
<p>If the number in the radical is not a perfect square, leave that part inside the radical. Let&rsquo;s solve another
  example.</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 2</p>
<p>Solve \(x^2&minus;50=0\).</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Isolate the quadratic term and make its coefficient 1. To do this, add 50 to both sides of the equation to get \(x^2\)
  by itself.</p>
<p>\(x^2&minus;50=0\) </p>
<p>\(x^2=50\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Use the square root property. Remember to write the symbol.</p>
<p>\(x = \pm \sqrt{50}\) </p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Simplify the radical by pulling out the factors that are perfect squares.</p>
<p>\(x = \pm \sqrt{25} \cdot \sqrt{2}\)</p>
<p>\(x = \pm 5 \sqrt{2}\)</p>
<p>\(x =5 \sqrt{2}\), \(x =&minus;5 \sqrt{2}\)</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  Check the solutions.</p>
<p>\(\begin{aligned}
  x^{2}-50=0 \\
  ({\style{color:red}5}
  \sqrt{{\style{color:red}2}})^{2}-50\stackrel{?}{=}0 \\
  25 \cdot 2-50\stackrel{?}{=}0 \\
  0=0 {\style{color:red}\checkmark} \\
  x^{2}-50=0 \\
  ({\style{color:red}-}{\style{color:red}5} \sqrt{{\style{color:red}2}})^{2}-50\stackrel{?}{=}0 \\
  25 \cdot 2-50\stackrel{?}{=}0 \\
  0=0 {\style{color:red}\checkmark} \\
  \end{aligned}\)</p>
<p>The steps for solving a quadratic equation using the square root property are listed here.</p>
<br>
<div class="os-raise-graybox">
  <p class="os-raise-text-bold">HOW TO&hellip;</p>
  <p>Solve a quadratic equation using the square root property.</p>
  <p>Step 1<br>

  <p>Step 3<br>
    Simplify the radical.</p>
  <p>Step 4 <br>
    Check the solutions.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>Before using the square root property in Step 2, the coefficient of the variable term must equal 1. In the next
  example, we must divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient 3 before using the square root property.</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 3</p>
<p>Solve \(3z^2=108\).</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Isolate the quadratic term and make its coefficient 1. When the quadratic term is isolated, divide by 3 to make its
  coefficient 1. Simplify.</p>
<p>\(3z^2=108\)</p>
<p>\(\frac{3z^2}{3}=\frac{108}{3}\) </p>
<p> \(z^2=36\) </p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Use the square root property.<br>
  \(z = \pm \sqrt{36}\) </p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Simplify the radical. Rewrite to show two solutions.<br>
  \(z= \pm 6\) </p>
<p>\(z=6\), \(z=-6\) </p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  Check the solutions.</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rr} 3 z^{2}=108 &amp; 3 z^{2}=108 \\ 3({\style{color:red}6})^{2} \stackrel{?}{=} 108 &amp;
