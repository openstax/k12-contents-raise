<h4>Student Facing Statement</h4>
<p>A factory produces &ldquo;widgets&rdquo; and &ldquo;zurls.&rdquo; The combined number of widgets and zurls made each day cannot be more than 12. The maximum number of widgets the factory can produce in a day is 4.</p>
<p>Let \(x\) be the number of widgets and \(y\) be the number of zurls.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Select <strong>all</strong> the inequalities that represent this situation.<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
      <li>\(x&lt;4\)</li>
      <li>\(x\leq4\)</li>
      <li>\(x&gt;4\)</li>
      <li>\(x+y&gt;12\)</li>
      <li>\(x+y\leq12\)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Here are graphs of \(x=4\) and \(x+y=12\).<br>Complete the graphs (by shading regions and adjusting line types as needed) to show all the allowable numbers of widgets and zurls that the factory can produce in one day.<br><img alt="Graph of a line, origin O.

<h4>Student Response</h4>

<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5><span>Press Pause</span></h5>
<p><span>If students are still struggling to shade graphs appropriately, highlight student work from the cool-down to address misconceptions and assign practice problems from this lesson for additional opportunities for students to practice</span><br></p>
