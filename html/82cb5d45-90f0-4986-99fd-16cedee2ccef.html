<p>Use this information to answer questions 1–7.
</p><blockquote>
<p>A factory produces &ldquo;widgets&rdquo; and &ldquo;zurls.&rdquo; The combined number of widgets and zurls made each day cannot be more than 12. The maximum number of widgets the factory can produce in a day is 4.</p>
<p>Let&nbsp;<span>\(x\) be the number of widgets and&nbsp;</span>\(y\) be the number of zurls.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li>Select <strong>two</strong> inequalities that represent this situation. 
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong>\(x\leq4\) and \(x+y\leq12\)</p>
    </li>   
    <li>Use the graphing tool or technology outside the course. Graph the equations \(x=4\) and \(x+y=12\). (Students were provided access to Desmos.)

<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>Press Pause</h5>
<p>If students are still struggling to shade graphs appropriately, highlight student work from the cool-down to address misconceptions and assign practice problems from this lesson for additional opportunities for students to practice<br></p>
