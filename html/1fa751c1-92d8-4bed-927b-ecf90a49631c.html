<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students again apply what they learned about quadratic expressions and their graphs. This time, they solve a contextual problem. Students consider how to change the parameters of a quadratic expression that models the movement of a digitally-animated object&mdash;a peanut&mdash;such that it travels in a parabolic path and meets certain restrictions.</p>
<p>Providing time to notice and wonder will elicit the idea that this equation shows the horizontal and vertical movement of the peanut, which will be useful when students adjust the equation in a later activity. While students may notice and wonder many things about the graphs and equations, connecting the vertex of the graph to the parameters in the equation are the important discussion points. This warm up prompts students to make sense of a problem before solving it by familiarizing themselves with a context and the mathematics that might be involved.</p>
<p>For the second question, there are many possible values of \(h\) and \(k\) that students could use. As students work, notice those who choose to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Shift the starting position of the peanut closer to the wall (translating the graph horizontally to the right). </li>
  <li> Stay in the same starting position but shift the vertex to a point closer to the wall. </li>
  <li> Shift both the peanut and the vertex of the parabolic path. </li>
</ul>
<p>If students choose to use graphing technology to help them experiment with expressions or verify their predictions, they practice choosing tools strategically.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Ask students to read the first couple of paragraphs in the statement. Then, display this graph for all to see. Tell students that when Mai used the equation \(y=-0.1(x&minus;16)^2+7\), this is the path of the peanut's jump.</p>

<p>Ask students what they notice and wonder about the equation and the graph. Make sure students see the connection between the parameters in the equation and the vertex of the graph before they proceed with the activity.</p>
<p>Provide continued access to graphing technology, in case students choose to use it.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Mai is learning to create computer animation by programming. In one part of her animation, she uses a quadratic function to model the path of the main character, an animated peanut, jumping over a wall.</p>
<p><img height="301" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/0250370ba6ce91f28fddd3ccbf84c786f82ea604" width="452"></p>
<p>Mai uses the equation \(y=-0.1(x&minus;h)^2+k\) to represent the path of the jump. \(y\) represents the height of the peanut as a function of the horizontal distance it travels, \(x\).</p>
<p>On the screen, the base of the wall is located at \((22,0)\), with the top of the wall at \((22,4.5)\). The dashed curve in the picture shows the graph of one equation Mai tried, where the peanut fails to make it over the wall.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is the value of \(h\) in this equation?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer: </strong>18
  </li>

  <li>What is the value of \(k\) in this equation?<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> 5
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Starting with Mai's equation, choose values for \(h\) and \(k\) that will guarantee the peanut stays on the screen but also makes it over the wall. Be prepared to explain your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the<strong> solution </strong>button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li> Use 22 for \(h\). Because \(h\) is the \(x\)-coordinate of the highest point of the jump, if that point is directly over the wall and the \(k\)-value remains at 5, then the peanut would clear the wall. So the new equation would be \(y=-0.1(x&minus;22)^2+5\). </li>
  <li> Change the value of \(k\), which is the vertical coordinate of the vertex, to 7 so that the vertex is at \((18,7)\) and there is still enough vertical distance to clear the 4.5-unit-tall wall when \(x\) is 22. The new equation would be \(y=-0.1(x&minus;18)^2+7\). </li>
</ul>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may randomly choose values for \(h\) and \(k\) until they find a combination whose graph meets the requirements. Encourage them to reason about the problem more systematically, by considering what they learned about the vertex form.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students with contrasting strategies to share their equations and explanations for the second question. To verify that students' proposed equations meet the animation criteria, consider graphing students' proposed equations for all to see. Highlight the three strategies mentioned in the Activity Narrative.</p>
<p>Point out one distinction between the graphs in this activity and previous graphs that represent projectile motions. In earlier cases, the output represented the height of an object as a function of time, so the graph of the function and physical trajectory of the object may be very different (for example, the object may be going straight up and then fall straight down, but the graph shows a parabola). Here, they see a model where the height of an object is a function of horizontal distance, so the path of the object in a projectile motion does resemble the graph representing the function.</p>

<h4>Determining the Vertex From a Graph</h4>
<p>Zaren made a paper football for a game at indoor recess and flicked it in the air from a table. The path of the paper football is shown below and represented by the function \(f(x)=-0 .02(x-h)^2+k\).</p>

<p>Find the value of the vertex and its meaning:</p>
<p>The peak of the graph is at \((17,3)\). This means the maximum horizontal distance traveled was 17 inches when the height of the object was 3 inches.</p>
