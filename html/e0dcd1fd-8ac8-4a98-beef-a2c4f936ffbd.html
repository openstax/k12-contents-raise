<h4> Comparing Transformations to Quadratic Graphs</h4>
<p>Remember that the graph representing any quadratic function is a shape called a parabola. People often say that a
  parabola "opens upward" when the lowest point on the graph is the vertex (where the graph changes direction), and
  "opens downward" when the highest point on the graph is the vertex. Each coefficient in a quadratic expression written
  in standard form \(ax^2+bx+c\) tells us something important about the graph that represents it.</p>
<p>The graph of \(y=x^2\) is a parabola opening upward with vertex at \((0,0)\). Adding a constant term 5 gives
  \(y=x^2+5\) and raises the graph by 5 units. Subtracting 4 from \(x^2\) gives \(y=x^2&minus;4\) and moves the graph 4
  units down.</p>

<p>A table of values can help us see that adding 5 to \(x^2\) increases all the output values of \(y=x^2\) by 5, which
  explains why the graph moves up 5 units. Subtracting 4 from \(x^2\) decreases all the output values of \(y=x^2\) by 4,
  which explains why the graph shifts down by 4 units.</p>
<br>
<p>In general, the constant term of a quadratic expression in standard form influences the vertical position of the
  graph. An expression with no constant term (such as \(x^2\) or \(x^2+9x\)) means that the constant term is 0, so the
  \(y\)-intercept of the graph is on the \(x\)-axis. It's not shifted up or down relative to the \(x\)-axis.</p>
<br>
<h4>Coefficient of the Squared Term </h4>
<p>The coefficient of the squared term in a quadratic function also tells us something about its graph. The coefficient
  of the squared term in \(y=x^2\) is 1. Its graph is a parabola that opens upward.</p>
<br>
<p>Multiplying \(x^2\) by a number greater than 1 makes the graph steeper, so the parabola is narrower than that
  representing \(x^2\).</p>
<p>Multiplying \(x^2\) by a number less than 1 but greater than 0 makes the graph less steep, so the parabola is wider
  than that representing \(x^2\).</p>
<p>Multiplying \(x^2\) by a number less than 0 makes the parabola open downward.</p>

<p>If we compare the output values of \(2x^2\) and \(-2x^2\), we see that they are opposites, which suggests that one
  graph would be a reflection of the other across the \(x\)-axis.</p>
<p>In the previous examples, parameters were being applied to the output values of the function. In other words, after an input value was squared, something was then added, subtracted, or multiplied with the squared value. The resulting impact on the graph was to vertically alter it.</p>
<p>However, what happens when the input value is altered before applying the exponent? In these situations, the impact on the graph is to produce a horizontal transformation.</p>
<h4>Horizontal Shifts</h4>
<p>Return to the quadratic parent function, \(f(x) = x^2\). The function is equivalent to \(f(x) = (x-0)^2\). While a bit obvious, this implies there is no change to the input value before being squared.</p>
<p>If the number used to change the input is greater than 0, then the graph of the function is shifted to the right.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the number used to change the input is less than 0, the graph of the function is shifted to the left. Note the impact to the subtraction operation when negative values are subtracted from the input.</p>

<p>Notice in this table of values that the change to the input values takes place before squaring the term. The constant is directly affecting the \(x\)-value before applying the function rule.</p>
<p>Examine the vertex of each graph. When we compare the graphs of  \((x-3)^2\) and  \((x+3)^2\) to the graph of the parent function, we see the parabola has been shifted to the right 3 units and left 3 units, respectively. Thus, a horizontal shift in the graph results when a constant has been subtracted from the input value.</p>
<p>Add a sub-header that says &ldquo;Horizontal Dilations and Reflections&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now we will investigate the impact of a coefficient on the input value.</p>
<p>Multiplying the input value by a value greater than 1 and then applying the exponent, results in a parabola that has been horizontally compressed.</p>
<p>Multiplying the input value by a value that is between 0 and 1, yields a parabola that has been horizontally stretched.</p>

<p>If the input value is multiplied by a negative number, then the parabola is reflected over the \(y\)-axis. However, due to the symmetric nature of parabolas, this is difficult to discern visually.</p>

<p>Multiplying the input value by a number changes the quantity that is squared. As a result, the graph of the equation is horizontally stretched or compressed. <br>
