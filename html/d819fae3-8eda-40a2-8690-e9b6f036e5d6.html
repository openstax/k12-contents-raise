<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity allows students to write radicals as terms with rational exponents and vice versa.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students into groups of 2.</p>
<br>
<h4> Student Activity</h4>
<p>If \(\sqrt[n]{a^m}\) is a real number and \(n\;\geq\;2\), then \(\sqrt[n]{a^m}\;=\;a^\frac mn\).</p>
<p>So radicals can be rewritten as rational exponents.</p>
<ol>
  <li>With a partner, write each radical as a term with rational exponents on your own paper. Then, turn and talk to your partner. Check your answers when you are ready.
    <ol type="a">
      <li> \(\sqrt[8]x\) <br><br>
        <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>\(x^\frac18\)
        <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li> \(\sqrt[3]{x^2}\) <br><br>
        <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>\(x^\frac23\)
        <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li> \(\sqrt[11]{x^5}\) <br><br>
        <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>\(x^\frac5{11}\)
        <br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Now, with a partner, rewrite each term as an equivalent radical. Check your answer to each.
    <ol type="a">
      <li> \(x^\frac12\) <br><br>
        <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>\(\sqrt[2]x\;\) or \(\;\sqrt x\)
        <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li> \(x^\frac17\) <br><br>
        <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>\(\sqrt[7]x\;\)
        <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li> \(x^\frac45\) <br><br>
        <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>\(\sqrt[5]{x^4}\;\)
      </li>
    </ol>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>When writing radicals as terms with rational exponents, it is important that the rational exponent has the original power on the top of the fraction and the index/root on the bottom.</p>
<p>A graphic organizer can help students as a reference for this.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite pairs to share their answers. Allow students to make their own examples and then trade with other partner groups if time allows.</p>
<ul>
  <li> First, have each pair write an example as a radical and switch with another pair. Then each pair writes the term with the rational exponent that matches their radical. </li>
  <li> Have each pair write a term with a rational exponent and then switch with another pair. Each pair writes the term as a radical. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Rewriting Radicals</h4>
<p><img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4c149ceb45a3e32a53d2f947157509651b7c3495" width="300"></p>
<p>When writing radicals as a term with a rational exponent, the exponent becomes the numerator of the fraction in the exponent, the root or index.</p>
<p>In the example above, the 2 is the exponent and becomes the top of the fraction. The 5 is the index and becomes the bottom of the fraction.</p>
<h4>Try It: Rewriting Radicals</h4>
<p>Write \(\sqrt[6]{x^5}\) as a term with a rational exponent.</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to rewrite the radical expression:</p>
<br>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Identify the index.<br>
  6</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Identify the exponent (inside the radical).<br>
  5</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Write the power over the root.<br>
  \(x^\frac56\)</p>
