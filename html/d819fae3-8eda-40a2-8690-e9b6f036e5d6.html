<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity allows students to write radicals as terms with rational exponents and vice versa.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students into groups of 2.</p>
<br>
<h4> Student Activity</h4>
<p>If \(\sqrt[n]{a^m}\) is a real number and \(n\;\geq\;2\), then \(\sqrt[n]{a^m}\;=\;a^\frac mn\).</p>
<p>So radicals can be rewritten as rational exponents.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>With a partner, write each radical as a term with rational exponents on your own paper. Then, turn and talk to your partner. Check your answers when you are ready.
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
      <li> \(\sqrt[8]x\) <br><br>
        <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>\(x^\frac18\)
        <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li> \(\sqrt[3]{x^2}\) <br><br>
        <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>\(x^\frac23\)
        <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li> \(\sqrt[11]{x^5}\) <br><br>
        <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>\(x^\frac5{11}\)
        <br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Now, with a partner, rewrite each term as an equivalent radical. Check your answer to each.
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
      <li> \(x^\frac12\) <br><br>
        <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>\(\sqrt[2]x\;\) or \(\;\sqrt x\)
        <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li> \(x^\frac17\) <br><br>
        <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>\(\sqrt[7]x\;\)
        <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li> \(x^\frac45\) <br><br>
        <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>\(\sqrt[5]{x^4}\;\)
      </li>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>When writing radicals as terms with rational exponents, it is important that the rational exponent has the original power on the top of the fraction and the index/root on the bottom.</p>
<p>A graphic organizer can help students as a reference for this.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite pairs to share their answers. Allow students to make their own examples and then trade with other partner groups if time allows.</p>
<ul>
  <li> First, have each pair write an example as a radical and switch with another pair. Then each pair writes the term with the rational exponent that matches their radical. </li>
  <li> Have each pair write a term with a rational exponent and then switch with another pair. Each pair writes the term as a radical. </li>
</ul>

        That&rsquo;s correct! Check yourself: The exponent gets written over the root.

      <td>
       \(10x^7\)
      </td>
      <td>
       Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: The 10 is the root, not a coefficient. The answer is \(x^\frac{7}{10}\).

        \(\frac7{10}x\)

<h4>Rewriting Radicals</h4>
<p><img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4c149ceb45a3e32a53d2f947157509651b7c3495" width="300"></p>
<p>When writing radicals as a term with a rational exponent, the exponent becomes the numerator of the fraction in the exponent, the root or index.</p>
<p>In the example above, the 2 is the exponent and becomes the top of the fraction. The 5 is the index and becomes the bottom of the fraction.</p>
<h4>Try It: Rewriting Radicals</h4>
