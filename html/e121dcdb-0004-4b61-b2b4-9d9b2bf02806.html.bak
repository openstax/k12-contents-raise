<h4>Graphing Linear Inequalities</h4>
<p>What number would make the inequality \( x &gt; 3 \) true? Are you thinking, “\(x\) could be four”? That’s correct, but \(x\) could be 6, too, or 37, or even 3.001. Any number greater than 3 is a solution to the inequality \( x &gt; 3 \). We show all the solutions to the inequality \(x &gt; 3\) on the number line by shading in all the numbers to the right of 3, to show that all numbers greater than 3 are solutions. Because the number 3 itself is not a solution, we put an open dot at 3.</p>
<p>We can also represent inequalities using interval notation. There is no upper end to the solution to this inequality. In interval notation, we express \( x &gt; 3 \) as \((3, ∞)\). The symbol ∞ is read as “infinity.” It is not an actual number.</p>
<p>The figure below shows both the number line and the interval notation.</p>
<p>                                                                          \( x &gt; 3 \)</p>
<p><img alt="A number line is shown. There is an open circle on 3. The number line to the right of 3 is highlighted." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="36" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/1f11f9f52563f8687b96d97d1f8d166c69c5b4d7" width="300"/><br/>
                                                                             \((3, ∞)\)<br/>
</p>
<p>The inequality \(x≤1\) means all numbers less than or equal to 1. Here we need to show that 1 is a solution, too. We do that by putting a closed circle at \(x = 1\). We then shade in all the numbers to the left of 1, to show that all numbers less than 1 are solutions. See the figure below.</p>
<p><img alt="A number line is shown. There is a closed circle on 1. The number line to the left of 1 is highlighted." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="36" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c89f24114c86a88a457ff1ee55c0119e4aea0a91" width="300"/></p>
<p>There is no lower end to those numbers. We write \( x ≤ 1 \) in interval notation as (−∞,1]. We use the left parenthesis symbol, (, to show that the endpoint of the inequality is not included. The right bracket symbol, }, shows that the endpoint is included. The symbol −∞ is read as “negative infinity.” </p>
<p>The figure below shows both the number line and interval notation.<br/>
