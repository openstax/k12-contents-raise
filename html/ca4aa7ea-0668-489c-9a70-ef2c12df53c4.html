<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>No technology should be used for this cool down.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Find all solutions to \((x+5)(2x&minus;3)=0\). Explain or show your reasoning.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=-5\) and \(x=\frac {3}{2}\)</p>
<p>By the zero product property, either \(x+5=0\) or \(2x&minus;3=0\), so \(x=-5\) and \(x=\frac {3}{2}\).</p>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
