<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>Students have described and analyzed situations involving exponential change, using graphs, tables, and equations.
  Now they revisit several of these contexts, viewing them as functions and expressing them using function language and
  notation.</p>
<p>Each situation involves two quantities, and students will need to choose one of these to be the independent variable
  and one to be the dependent variable. For all of these relationships, it is possible to choose either variable as the
  independent, but one choice gives a logarithmic function (which is out of the scope of this course), while the other
  gives an exponential function. In each case, however, students have previously worked with the context.</p>
<p>Look for students who explicitly state the meaning of their variables, including units, and invite them to share
  during the discussion. For example, in the second situation, if \(t\) represents the number of years and
  \(v\)<em>&nbsp;</em>represents the value of the car, in dollars, after \(t\)<em>&nbsp;</em>years, then \(v\)&nbsp;can
  be viewed as a function \(f\) of \(t\)&nbsp;where \(f(t)=18,000(\frac{2}{3})^t\). The meaning and units for both
  \(t\) and \(f(t)\) (or \(v\)) are vital elements to answering the question fully.</p>
<p>Use the function
  \(f(x) = ab^x\), to explain dependent and independent variables.</p>
<p>Dependent variable: The dependent variable is the variable that depends on or is influenced by the independent
  variable. In this case, the dependent variable is \(f(x)\), which represents the output or value of the function. It is
  determined by the value of \(x\) and the parameters \(a\) and \(b\).</p>
<p> Independent variable: The independent variable is the variable that is not influenced by any other variable in the
  context of the function. It is typically \(x\) and represents the input or value for which the function is evaluated.
  The independent variable can have various values, and it is the variable which can be controlled or manipulated.</p>
<p>In the given function \(f(x) = ab^x\), the value of \(f(x)\) depends on the value of \(x\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are constant
  parameters. By plugging in different values for \(x\), we can determine the values of \(f(x)\) using the given function.</p>
<p>So, In the function \(f(x) = ab^x\), the dependent variable is \(f(x)\), and the independent variable is \(x\).</p>
<h4> Launch</h4>
<p>Tell students that they will now revisit some previously seen situations. Ask students to read the three situations
  in the task. Then solicit a few ideas on why all of them can be seen as functions.</p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may confuse the terms &ldquo;independent&rdquo; and &ldquo;dependent.&rdquo; Help them think about which
  variable depends on the other in context.</p>
<h4> Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite selected students to present their equations, making sure to indicate what each variable represents, as well
  as the units of the variable.</p>
<p>For the third question, point out that it is a short step from an equation for the area covered by the algae \(A=240
  \cdot (\frac
  {1}{3})^t\) to a similar equation with function notation. The equation gives the area covered by the algae at each
  time \(t\), so a function \(f\) can be defined using the same expression: \(f(t)=240 \cdot (\frac{1}{3})^t\) and
  \(A=f(t)\).</p>
