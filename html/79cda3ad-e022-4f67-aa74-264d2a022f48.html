<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>Students have described and analyzed situations involving exponential change, using graphs, tables, and equations. Now they revisit several of these contexts, viewing them as functions and expressing them using function language and notation.</p>
<p>Each situation involves two quantities, and students will need to choose one of these to be the independent variable and one to be the dependent variable. For all of these relationships, it is possible to choose either variable as the independent, but one choice gives a logarithmic function (which is out of the scope of this course), while the other gives an exponential function. In each case, however, students have previously worked with the context.</p>
<p>Look for students who explicitly state the meaning of their variables, including units, and invite them to share during the discussion. For example, in the second situation, if \(t\) represents the number of years and \(v\)<em>&nbsp;</em>represents the value of the car, in dollars, after \(t\)<em>&nbsp;</em>years, then \(v\)&nbsp;can be viewed as a function \(f\) of \(t\)&nbsp;where \(f(t)=18,000(\frac{2}{3})^t\). The meaning and units for both \(t\)<em>&nbsp;</em>and \(f(t)\) (or \(v\)) are vital elements to answering the question fully.</p>
<h4> Launch</h4>
<p>Tell students that they will now revisit some previously seen situations. Ask students to read the three situations in the task. Then solicit a few ideas on why all of them can be seen as functions.</p>
<h5> Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>
<div>
<p>Create a display of important terms and vocabulary. Invite students to brainstorm vocabulary and phrases that they associate with each variable of \(y=a(b)^x\). Compile words and phrases that will assist students with setting up equations on a display. This may include labels such as &ldquo;independent variable,&rdquo; &ldquo;dependent variable,&rdquo; &ldquo;multiplier,&rdquo; and &ldquo;starting point,&rdquo; and also specific words explored in previous examples to incorporate prior knowledge. If referencing the moldy bread scenario, the labels of &ldquo;output&rdquo; and &ldquo;input&rdquo; can also be paired with &ldquo;area&rdquo; and &ldquo;time,&rdquo; respectively.</p>
</div>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here are some situations we have seen previously. For each situation:</p>
<ul>
<li> Write a sentence of the form &ldquo;_____ is a function of _____.&rdquo;</li>
<li> Indicate which is the independent and which is the dependent variable. </li>
<li> Write an equation that represents the situation using function notation. </li>
</ul>

<br>
</strong>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
<li> The value of a car is a function of the number of years since purchase. </li>

        f(t)=18,000 \cdot (\frac{2}{3})^t\). Note: \(\frac13\) is the rate, and growth factor \(=1-\) rate, so the growth factor is \(\frac23\) because there&rsquo;s \(\frac23\) left. </li>

<strong>ANSWER:</strong> <br>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may confuse the terms &ldquo;independent&rdquo; and &ldquo;dependent.&rdquo; Help them think about which variable depends on the other in context.</p>
<h4> Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite selected students to present their equations, making sure to indicate what each variable represents, as well as the units of the variable.</p>
<p>For the third question, point out that it is a short step from an equation for the area covered by the algae \(A=240 \cdot (\frac
  {1}{3})^t\) to a similar equation with function notation. The equation gives the area covered by the algae at each time \(t\), so a function \(f\) can be defined using the same expression: \(f(t)=240 \cdot (\frac{1}{3})^t\) and \(A=f(t)\).</p>
<h5> Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<div>
<p> Use this routine to support whole-class discussion. After each student shares, provide the class with the following sentence frames to help them respond: &ldquo;I agree because . . .&rdquo; or &ldquo;I disagree because . . . .&rdquo; If necessary, revoice student ideas to demonstrate mathematical language use by restating a statement as a question to clarify, apply appropriate language, and involve more students.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s correct! Check yourself: The initial price of the computer was 2,500, and each year the price was multiplied by \(\frac45\).&nbsp;</p>

<p>\(f(t)=\frac{4}{5} \cdot (2500)^t\)</p>
</td>

<p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: The base of the exponential function is the growth factor, not the initial value. The 2,500 and \(\frac45\) should be switched in the formula. The answer is \(f(t)=2500 \cdot (\frac{4}{5})^t\).&nbsp;</p>
