    In this project, you will revisit using an area model as a tool for finding products. You will start with a numerical area model, focusing on two-digit numbers and reviewing that you can partition a rectangle into smaller areas whose sum is the total area of the rectangle. Then, you will then apply this area model to algebraic expressions where an area model can be used to multiply polynomials.
    First, you will be asked to play with a simulation for a few minutes. This open play time allows for you to learn how to use a simulation for learning and discover how to interact with it. You will have an opportunity to share how you used the simulation during the open play time. Be sure you are aware of the controls and how to use the simulation.

    When you engage with the activity sheet, you should be pausing to discuss some of your responses with a partner. Be prepared to stop and share your individual responses and partner discussions with the whole class.
    By the end of the lesson, you should have completed the activity sheets using the simulation, and should be able to use an area model to multiply two two-digit numbers or two polynomials, and explain why an area model can be used to find the product of two factors.
