<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>Earlier in the unit, students solved equations with a squared variable on one side and a square number on the other,
  for example, \(x^2=49\) or \(4x^2=100\). This activity allows students to see that more complicated quadratic
  equations can also be solved relatively easily when both sides of the equal sign are perfect squares. The work here
  motivates upcoming lessons on completing the square.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Display the two solutions from the task statement for all to see. Give students a
  moment to study and make sense of the two methods. Then, ask them to talk to their partner about what Han and Jada did
  at each step in their solution.</p>
<p>Next, ask students which method they prefer and why. They are likely to prefer Jada's method since it takes far fewer
  steps, but some might prefer Han's method because it is more familiar. Tell partners that they will take turns solving
  equations with each method and get a better feel for each method.</p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may need scaffolding beginning with solving equations such as \(x^2=9\), which becomes
  \(\sqrt{x^2}=\sqrt{9}\) so \(x=\pm 3\). Show students that both solutions \(x= 3\) and \(x =-3\) work when checked
  into the original equation. Students have limited experience with the \(\pm\) that is needed and may need further
  explanation and practice to show that \(\sqrt{x^2}\) will result in two solutions.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students to display their solutions for all to see. Ask students to reflect on the merits of the solution
  methods. Make sure they recognize that when equations are in perfect squares, they are easier to solve because we can
  find their square roots.</p>
<p>Point out that all the equations in this activity already have perfect squares on both sides, but most equations that
  we need to solve do not. Tell students that in upcoming lessons, they will learn how to transform equations so that
  they have a perfect square and can be more easily solved.</p>

<h4>Two Ways to Solve Quadratic Equations</h4>
<p>In the activity, Han and Jada used two different methods for solving a quadratic equation, using the distributive
  property and the square root property.</p>
<h4>Using the Distributive Property to Solve Quadratic Equations</h4>
<br>
<div class="os-raise-graybox">
  <p> <strong> How to Solve a Quadratic Equation Using the Distributive Property: </strong></p>
  <hr>
  <p><strong>Step 1 </strong> -Isolate the quadratic term and make its coefficient 1.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2 </strong> -Rewrite the term so the binomial is multiplied by itself.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3 </strong> -Use the distributive property or FOIL.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4 </strong> -Combine like terms so that the equation is set equal to 0.</p>
  <p> Step 5<br> Factor.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 6 </strong> -Set each factor equal to 0.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 7 </strong> -Solve.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 8 </strong> -Check the solutions.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Solve \(4(x-7)^2=36\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Isolate the quadratic term (divide by 4).<br>
  \((x-7)^2=9\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Rewrite the term so the binomial is multiplied by itself.<br>
  \((x-7)(x-7)=9\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Use the distributive property or FOIL.<br>
  \(x^2-7x-7x+49=9\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Combine like terms so that the equation is set equal to 0.<br>
  \(x^2-14x+40=0\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> - Factor.<br>
  \((x-10)(x-4)=0\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong> - Set each factor equal to 0.<br>
  \(x-10=0\), \(x-4=0\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong> - Solve.<br>
  \(x-10=0\;\;\;\;\;\;x-4=0\)<br>
  \(x=10\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;x=4\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong> - Check the solutions.<br>
  \(4(10-7)^2=36\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;4(4-7)^2=36\)<br>
  \(4(3)^2=36\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;4(-3)^2=36\)<br>
  \(36=36\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;36=36\)</p>

<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to solve the quadratic equation using the distributive property.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Isolate the quadratic term (divide by 3).<br>
  \((x-4)^2=16\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Rewrite the term so the binomial is multiplied by itself.<br>
  \((x-4)(x-4)=16\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Use the distributive property or FOIL.<br>
  \(x^2-4x-4x+16=16\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Combine like terms so that the equation is set equal to 0.<br>
  \(x^2-8x=0\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> - Factor.<br>
  \(x(x-8)=0\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong> - Set each factor equal to 0.<br>
  \(x=0\) or \(x-8=0\) </p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong> - Solve.<br>
  \(x=0\;\;\;\;\;\;x-8=0\)<br>
  \(x=0\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;x=8\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong> - Check the solutions.<br>
  \(3(0-4)^2=48\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;3(8-4)^2=48\)<br>
  \(3(-4)^2=48\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;3(4)^2=48\)<br>
  \(48=48\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;48=48\) </p>
<h4>Using the Square Root Property to Solve Quadratic Equations</h4>
<p>If \(x^2=k\), then</p>
<p>
  \(\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;x=\sqrt{k}\;\;\;\;\;\;\)or\(\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;x=-\sqrt{k}\;\;\;\;\;\;\)or\(\;\;\;\;\;\;x=\pm\sqrt{k}\)
