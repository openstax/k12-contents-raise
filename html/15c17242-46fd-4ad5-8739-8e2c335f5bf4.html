<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<p>On a family outing, Marlon bought 5 cups of hot cocoa and 4 pretzels for $18.40. Some of his family members would like a second serving, so he went back to the same food stand and bought another 2 cups of hot cocoa and 4 pretzels for $11.20.</p>
<p>Here is a system of equations that represent the quantities and constraints in this situation.</p>
<p>\( \left\{ \begin{array}{c l} 5c + 4p = 18.40\\ 2c + 4p = 11.20 \end{array}\right. \)<br></p>
<p><span>1. What does the solution to the system, \( (c, p) \), represent in this situation?</span><br></p>
<p>2. If we add the second equation to the first equation, we have a new equation: \(&nbsp;7c + 8p = 29.60&nbsp;\).</p>
<p>Explain why the same \(&nbsp;(c, p)&nbsp;\) pair that is a solution to the two original equations is also a solution to this new equation.</p>
<p>3. Does the equation \(&nbsp;7c + 8p = 29.60&nbsp;\) help us solve the original system? If you think so, explain how it helps. If you don&rsquo;t think so, explain why not and what would help us solve the system.</p>

<h4>Student Response</h4>
<p>1. The values of&nbsp;\( c \) and&nbsp;\( p \) represent the price of a cup of hot cocoa and the price of a pretzel that Marlon bought.<br><span><br>2. Sample explanations:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>The new equation shows the total number of cups of hot cocoa and total number of pretzels on one side, and the total amount Marlon spent on the other side. The price of each cup of hot cocoa and the price of each pretzel haven&rsquo;t changed.</li>
  <li>\( 2c + 4p \)&nbsp;and 11.20 are equal, so adding&nbsp;\( 2c + 4p \) to one side of an equation and adding 11.20 to the other side means adding equal amounts to the two sides of an equation. This keeps the two sides equal. The same values of \(p\) and \(c\) that make the original equations true haven&rsquo;t changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. No, it doesn&rsquo;t help. For example: It doesn&rsquo;t eliminate a variable. What would help is subtracting the second equation from the first to get \( 3c = 7.20 \). Then we can find&nbsp;\( c \) and solve for \( p \).</p>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool- down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
