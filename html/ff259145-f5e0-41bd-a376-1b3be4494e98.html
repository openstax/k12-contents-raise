<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<p>The function \(W\) gives the temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit, of a pot of water on a stove \(t\) minutes after the stove is turned on. After 30 minutes, the pot is taken off the stove.</p>
<p>The graph of the function is shown.</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> Is 250 in the range of function \(W\)? Explain how you know. </li>
<li> Describe the range of the function. </li>
<li> Does \(W(t)=0\) have a solution? Explain how you know. </li>
</ol>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> No, 250 is not in the range. The highest temperature is 212 degrees Fahrenheit. </li>
<li> The range is all values between 75 and 212, the lowest and the highest temperature, \(75\leq y\leq212.\) </li>
<li> No, a solution to this equation would be the time when the temperature is 0 degrees Fahrenheit, which is never the case. </li>
</ol>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>If students are still struggling with domain and range, examine errors in the cool-down and make sure to discuss domain and range during each of the activities in Lesson 13.</p>
