<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>Previously, students wrote equations to model relationships presented via verbal descriptions. In this partner
  activity, students are presented with pairs of values that represent quantities and take turns describing the
  relationship between the quantities&mdash;first using words, and then using equations.</p>
<p>To do so, they need to interpret the values in context, look for structure or patterns, and generalize them. As they
  do so, students also practice reasoning quantitatively and abstractly. As students trade roles explaining their
  thinking and listening, they have opportunities to explain their reasoning and critique the reasoning of others.</p>
<p>As students discuss their thinking, listen for the different ways they describe the same relationship. For example,
  here are some ways students might describe the relationship in the second table (&ldquo;meters from home&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;meters from school&rdquo;):</p>
<ul>
  <li>The distance from home and the distance from school always add up to 400.</li>
  <li>The distance from school is always 400 minus the distance from home.</li>
  <li>As the distance from home, \(x \), increases by a number, the distance from school, \(y \), decreases by the same
    number. \(x \) starts at 0, and \(y \) starts at 400.</li>
  <li>The distance between home and school is 400 meters. The table seems to be telling us about a person traveling from
    home to school and how their distance to home and distance to school change along the way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Select students with different analyses and descriptions to share later.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Print the blackline document &ldquo;Whose Data Is This?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Have students cut out the variable cards and the data boxes. In pairs, have students work together to create viable
  arguments for matching the variables with the data. This discussion naturally provides the opportunity to discuss how
  the quantities are related.</p>

    target="_blank">&ldquo;Whose Data Is This?&rdquo;</a></p>
<p>This will lead the discussion for problem number 1.</p>
<p>Consider asking partners to also take turns matching the tables to the equations in the second question.</p>
<p>Some students may not know what is meant by &ldquo;amount deposited&rdquo; in Table D. Clarify this term to students
  if needed.</p>
<p>If time is limited, consider asking each group to analyze only two of the tables.</p>

  <h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
  <p><em>Conversing: MLR8 Discussion Supports.</em>Arrange students in groups of 2. Students should take turns finding a
    match and explaining their reasoning to their partner. Display the following sentence frames for all to see:
    &ldquo;_____ and _____ are equivalent because . . .&rdquo; and &ldquo;I noticed _____ , so I matched . . .&rdquo;
    Encourage students to challenge each other when they disagree. This will help students clarify their reasoning about
    equations that represent the relationship.

  <p><em>Engagement: Provide Access by Recruiting Interest.</em> Leverage choice around perceived challenge. Invite
    students to select 1&ndash;2 tables to describe in words and to use the tables they described as a starting point to
    match equations. Chunking this task into more manageable parts may also benefit students who benefit from additional
    processing time.

  The amount deposited is $400 less than the monthly salary. (The employer might deduct $400 per paycheck for taxes,
  health insurance, retirement savings, and so on. Or, the employee might first pay $400 in rent or other expenses
  before depositing the rest of the monthly salary.)

<h4>Video: Describing Relationships</h4>

  equations, specifically looking at the base and height of different rectangles.1</p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>The relationship in Table D may not be obvious to students. Encourage students who get stuck to look at the equations
  in the last question and try to figure out which equation describes the relationship between the numbers in the table.
</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite previously identified students to share how they thought about one of the relationships in the first question.
  Start with students who reasoned only in terms of numerical operations, and move toward those who interpreted the
  quantities in context (as shown in the Activity Narrative). If possible, record and display their descriptions for all
  to see, and highlight the connections between the different responses.</p>
<p>Discuss with students whether or how their ways of thinking about each relationship affected the work of matching the
  tables and equations. If not brought up in students&rsquo; comments, point out that some ways of describing a
  relationship could make it easier to identify or write a corresponding equation. Really understanding what&rsquo;s
  happening in the situation, however, often requires carefully interpreting the operations that relate the two
  quantities.</p>
