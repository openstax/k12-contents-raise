<h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>
<p>Previously, students have repeatedly solved an equation for one of the variables after the values of the other
  variables are specified. They then generalized that process and learned that it is possible, and sometimes preferable,
  to solve for the variable before substituting known values or performing calculations. In this lesson, they practice
  solving for the variable first and obtaining an expression that defines it in terms of the others. They see that doing
  so allows them to solve problems more efficiently. Spreadsheets and other computer programs can help illustrate the
  benefits of isolating a variable. Students see that once a variable of interest is isolated and expressed in terms of
  all the other variables, a computer program can use that expression (even if it seems complicated) and speedily
  calculate its value when the other variables take on different values. The interactive model is a powerful way to test
  different assumptions in a situation.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Practice writing equations in two or more variables and solving for a particular variable.</li>
  <li>Solve for a variable by performing acceptable operations, including when the values of other quantities in a
    multi-variable equation are not known.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Solve an equation for one of the variables.</li>
</ul>
