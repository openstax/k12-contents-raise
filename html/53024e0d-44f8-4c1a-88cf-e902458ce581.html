<div class="main">
  <div class="preparation">Previously, students have repeatedly solved an equation for one of the variables after the values of the other variables are specified. They then generalized that process and learned that it is possible, and sometimes preferable, to solve for the variable before substituting known values or performing calculations.&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="preparation"><span><br></span></div>
  <div class="preparation"><span>In this lesson, they practice solving for the variable first and obtaining an expression that defines it in terms of the others. They see that doing so allows them to solve problems more efficiently.</span></div>
  <div class="preparation"><span><br></span></div>
  <div class="preparation"><span>Spreadsheets and other computer programs can help illustrate the benefits of isolating a variable. Students see that once a variable of interest is isolated and expressed in terms of all the other variables, a computer program can use that expression (even if it seems complicated) and speedily calculate its value when the other variables take on different values. The interactive model is a powerful way to test different assumptions in a situation.</span></div>
