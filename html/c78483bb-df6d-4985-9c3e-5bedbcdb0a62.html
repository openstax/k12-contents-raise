<h3>Activity: P4.1: Estimate Time to Charge a Battery</h3>
<p>Think about an electronic device with a battery that you have to charge on a regular basis.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> What device is it? </li>
  <li> When you are using the device, approximately how long does it take the battery to go from 100% charged until the time you need to plug it in again to recharge? </li>
  <li> Approximately how long does it take to charge to 100% starting from 0% or nearly 0%? </li>
  <li> Approximately how long does it take to charge if you plugged in your device when the battery was 50% charged? </li>
  <li> How long do you think it would take to recharge the device to 100% from 50% compared to the time it would take if the device was at 0%? Would it be exactly half the time, more than half the time, or less than half the time it would take if starting from 0%? </li>
</ol>
