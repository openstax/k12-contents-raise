<h4>Determining Growth Factors</h4>
<p>Is the pattern below represented by a function that is linear, exponential, or quadratic?</p>
<p><img alt="A pattern of squares. Step 0 has 1 square. Step 1 has a t-shaped pattern that consists of three squares in two rows. The squares are arranged so that the square in the bottom row is offset from the two squares in the row above it so they form the shape of the letter t. Step 2 is a combination of three of these t-shapes in one row. So, there are 6 squares in row 2 and 3 squares on the bottom row off set from the adjoining squares above them.  Step 3 consists of nine of these t-shapes. There are three t-shapes on the bottom and then six t-shapes in the next level above. To breakdown all of the rows, step 3 has a total of 4 rows. The bottom row has three squares with the row above it containing six squares. This set constitutes the first set of t-shapes. Then, row 3 contains 6 squares with row 4 containing 12 squares. This is the second set of t-shapes." height="95" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/7ca96c977bc1e26345b0e0cc01660a4435234178" width="500"/></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Draw a table. In the right column, determine the growth factor.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Write the function to represent the pattern.</p>
<p>\(f(x)=3^x\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Determine what type of function this is.</p>
<p>The function is exponential.</p>

<p>Here is how to use the growth factor to determine if this pattern is represented by a linear, quadratic, or
    exponential function:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Create a table and determine the growth factor.</p>
<table class="os-raise-wideequaltable">

<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Determine the function.</p>
<p>\(f(x)=3x^2\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Determine what type of function this is.</p>
<p>This is a quadratic function. The growth rate changes between each step.</p>
