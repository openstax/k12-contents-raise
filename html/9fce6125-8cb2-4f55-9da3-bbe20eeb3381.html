<p>In this lesson, you will continue working with the vertex form of quadratic equations. You will discover that you can anticipate what happens on the graph on either side of the vertex by reasoning about the parts of an expression in vertex form.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> Graph a quadratic function given in vertex form, showing the maximum or minimum and the \(y\)-intercept. </li>
<li> Find the maximum or the minimum of a quadratic function given in vertex form without first graphing it. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
