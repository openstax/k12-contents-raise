<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students encounter another visual pattern that changes quadratically. The number of squares in the
  pattern is related to the step number \(n\) by the rule \(n^2+2\). Because of the addition of 2 to \(n^2\), the
  squaring of \(n\) may not be as apparent as in the earlier activity (where the output values were perfect squares).
  This prompt gives students opportunities to see and make use of structure. A specific structure they might notice from
  the visual pattern is the 2-by-2 square in Step 2 and the 3-by-3 square in Step 3.</p>
<p>As in the previous activity, students reason repeatedly, extend the pattern, and then write a general expression
  describing the pattern. They also consider whether the pattern is linear or exponential and explain why it is or
  isn't.</p>
<p>As students work, look for students who draw a picture (especially for Step 5), those who describe the picture
  (especially for Steps 10 and 12), and those who rely on numerical (rather than visual) reasoning. Invite them to share
  their strategies during the synthesis of this activity.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Display the pattern of squares for all to see. Ask students to be prepared to share one thing they notice and one
  thing they wonder about. Give them a moment to share their observations and questions with a partner.</p>
<p>The last question asks whether the pattern grows exponentially. If needed, remind students that a quantity that
  changes exponentially grows or decays by equal factors over equal intervals.</p>

<strong>Answer:</strong> No, there are 3 squares in the first step, 6 squares in the second step, and 11 squares in
    the third step. So the number of additional squares is 3 going from the first to the second step and 5 going from
    the second to the third step.

<li>Is the number of small squares growing exponentially? Explain how you know.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Answer:</strong> No, from Step 1 to Step 2, the number of squares doubles. From Step 2 to Step 3, the number
    of squares increases by a factor of \(\frac{11}{6}\). From Step 3 to Step 4, the number of squares increases by a
    factor of \(\frac{18}{11}\). These growth factors are all different; in contrast, for an exponential function, the
    values increase by equal growth factors over equal intervals.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The nth expression, \(n^2+2\), is an example of a quadratic expression. A quadratic expression can be written using a
  squared term. It can be written in other ways as well, but the expression should be able to be written with the
  highest exponent on the variable as 2.</p>
<ul>
<li> A quadratic relationship is not like a linear relationship because as one quantity increases by a certain amount,
    the second quantity doesn’t increase by the same amount. </li>
<li> A quadratic relationship is not like an exponential relationship because as one quantity increases by a certain
    amount, the second quantity doesn’t change by the same factor. (In this case, if the number of squares grew
    exponentially, this would mean that, from each step to the next, the number of squares is multiplied by the same
    factor.) </li>

<h3>Student Facing Extension</h3>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>Han wrote \(n(n+2)-2(n-1)\) for the number of small squares in the design at Step \(n\) in the pattern at the
  beginning of the activity.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>Explain why Han is correct.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Answer:</strong> At Step \(n\), there is an \(n\) by \(n+2\) rectangle containing \(n(n+2)\) small squares
    with two columns of \(n-1\) squares removed from either side.

</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li>On your own, draw and label what Step 3 would look like when Han was writing his expression.<br/>

    removed the two small squares from the first column and the last column.

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may struggle to draw the next step in the visual pattern. Prompt them to compare Steps 2 and 3 and
  describe what stays the same and what changes. For example, the two small squares on either side stay the same, and
  the square in the middle increases. If needed, show them a drawing for Step 4 (two 1-by-1 squares on each side with a
  4-by-4 square in the middle) and ask them to draw Step 5.</p>
<p>Some students may not notice the table goes from Step 4 to Step 10 and record 27 (the number of small squares for
  Step 5) instead of 102. Prompt them to draw a picture of Step 10 and count the number of small squares in their
  drawing. Emphasize that when the step size increases by more than 1, we are skipping ahead several steps and our
  pattern needs to reflect that as well. Show students a table with the missing steps included so they can see the
  growth pattern.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students to share their strategies for determining how the pattern was growing. Start from concrete
  approaches, relying on images, and work toward more abstract representations, using equations. Help students make
  connections between their conclusions by asking where the \(+2\) can be seen in the picture and where they see the
  \(n^2\) term. After the expression \(n^2+2\) comes up, introduce the term <em>quadratic</em>.</p>
<p>Explain that the relationship between the step number and the number of squares is a quadratic relationship, which
  includes one quantity (the step number, in this case) being multiplied by itself to obtain a second quantity (the
  number of squares).</p>
<p>In middle school, we expressed area of squares with side lengths \(s\) as \(s^2\). The relationship between the side
  length and the area of the square is a quadratic relationship. \(s^2\) is an example of a quadratic expression. The
  expression we wrote in this activity, \(n^2+2\), is also an example of a quadratic expression. A quadratic expression
  can be written using a squared term, but it can be written in other ways as well.</p>
<p>If not already mentioned in students’ explanations, point out that:</p>
<ul>
<li> A quadratic relationship is not like a linear relationship because as one quantity increases by a certain amount,
    the second quantity doesn’t increase by the same amount. </li>
<li> A quadratic relationship is not like an exponential relationship because as one quantity increases by a certain
    amount, the second quantity doesn’t change by the same factor. (In this case, if the number of squares grew
    exponentially, this would mean that, from each step to the next, the number of squares is multiplied by the same
    factor.) </li>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Notice that the start has 2 rows and 2 columns, or 4 dots.<br/>
  Each step adds a row of 2 dots, plus 1 more dot.<br/>
  So, each step adds 3 dots.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Continuing this linear pattern, Step 5 would have 19 dots. </p>

<p>Each step has that number of dots squared, then doubled, and then one is added.</p>
