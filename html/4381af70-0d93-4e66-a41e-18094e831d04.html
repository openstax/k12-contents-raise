<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students continue to develop their ability to interpret statements in function notation in terms of a situation, including reasoning about inequalities such as \(f(a)&gt;f(b)\). They now have to pay closer attention to the units in which the quantities are measured to effectively interpret symbolic statements. Along the way, students practice reasoning quantitatively and abstractly and attending to precision.</p>
<p>Students also begin to connect statements in function notation to graphs of functions. They see each input-output pair of a function \(f\) as a point with coordinates \((x,f(x))\) when \(x\) is the input, and they use information in function notation to sketch a possible graph of a function.</p>
<p>Students&rsquo; work with graphs is expected to be informal here. In a later lesson, students will focus on identifying features of graphs more formally.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Describe connections between statements that use function notation and a graph of the function.</li>
  <li>Practice interpreting statements that use function notation and explaining (orally and in writing) their meaning in terms of a situation.</li>
  <li>Sketch a graph of a function given statements in function notation and describe the connections between a statement in function notation and the graph of the function.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Describe the connections between a statement in function notation and the graph of the function.</li>
  <li>Use function notation to efficiently represent a relationship between two quantities in a situation.</li>
  <li>Use statements in function notation to sketch a graph of a function.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A1(E) internalize new basic and academic language by using and reusing it in meaningful ways in speaking and writing activities that build concept and language attainment</li>
  <li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
  <li>A3(F) ask and give information ranging from using a very limited bank of high-frequency, high-need, concrete vocabulary, including key words and expressions needed for basic communication in academic and social contexts, to using abstract and content-based vocabulary during extended speaking assignments</li>
  <li>A3(I) adapt spoken language appropriately for formal and informal purposes</li>
  <li>A5(B) write using newly acquired basic vocabulary and content-based grade-level vocabulary</li>
</ul>
<h4>Support for Building Character</h4>
<p>Throughout this unit, find ways to encourage and support students to work on cultivating their <strong>creativity</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to try during this lesson:</p>
