<h2>Activity (20 minutes)</h2>
<div>
  <p>In the previous activity, students analyzed and
    interpreted points on a graph relative to an equation and a situation.
    In this activity, they write a linear equation to model a situation, use
    graphing technology to graph the equation, and then use the graph to
    solve problems. Each given situation involves an initial value and a
    constant rate of change.</p>
  <p>Before students begin the activity, introduce them to
    the graphing technology available in the classroom. Offer a quick
    tutorial on how to graph equations, adjust the graphing window, and plot
    points. This tutorial could happen independently of the activity as
    long as it precedes the activity.</p>
</div>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<div>
  <p>Give all students access to graphing technology. Tell
    students that in this course they will frequently use technology to
    create a graph that represents an equation and use the graph to solve
    problems.</p>
  <p>Demonstrate how to use the technology available in your
    classroom to create and view graphs of equations. Explain how to enter
    equations, adjust the graphing window, and plot a point. If using
    Desmos, please see the digital version of this activity for suggested
    instructions.</p>
  <p>Arrange students in groups of 2&ndash;4. Assign one
    situation to each group. Ask students to answer the first few questions,
    including writing an equation, and then graph the equation and answer
    the last question.</p><br>
  <h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>
  <div>
    <p><em>Representation: Access for Perception.</em>
      Provide students with a physical copy of written directions for using
      graphing technology and read them aloud. Include step-by-step directions
      for how to enter equations, adjust the graphing window, and plot a
      point. <br><em>Supports accessibility for: Language; Memory
      </em>

      <p>Select a group that analyzed the first situation and a

        Display their graphs for all to see.</p>
      <p>Focus the discussion on two things: what the points on the graph mean and how the graph could be used to answer
        questions about the quantities in each situation. Discuss questions such
        as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>&ldquo;How did
          you find the answers to the first two questions?&rdquo; (By calculation, for
          example, computing \( 475 + 125(3) \), or finding \( 1,\!350 - 475 \),
          and then dividing by 125.)</li>
        <li>&ldquo;How did
          you find the answer to the last question?&rdquo; (By calculation, for
          instance, finding \( 7,\!000 - 475 \), and then dividing by 125. Or,
          alternatively, by using the graph.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Highlight how
        the graph of the equations could be
        used to answer the questions. If not already mentioned by students,
        discuss how the graph of \( y=475-125x \) can be used to find the
        answers to all the questions about the student&rsquo;s savings account, and
        the graph of \( y=450-20x \) can help us with the questions about
        draining the water tank.</p>
      <p>Keep the graphs of the two equations displayed for the lesson summary.</p>

      <h3>Writing Equations Using Graphs in Situations&nbsp;</h3>
      <p>An equation that contains two
        unknown quantities or two quantities that vary is called an equation in
        two variables. A solution to such an equation is a pair of numbers that
        makes the equation true.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Suppose Tyler spends $45 on
        T-shirts and socks. A T-shirt costs $10, and a pair of socks costs
        $2.50. If&nbsp;\( t \) represents the number of T-shirts and&nbsp;\( p \)
        represents the number of pairs of socks that Tyler buys, what is an
        equation that represents the situation?</p>
      <p>The cost is $10 per T-shirt \(&nbsp;(10t)&nbsp;\) plus $2.50 per pair of socks \(&nbsp;(2.50p)&nbsp;\), which equals $45.</p>
      <p>\( 10t +2.50p = 45 \)</p>
      <p>Let&rsquo;s look at the graph of this equation:&nbsp;</p>
      <strong><img height="355" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/402234f66bee06cb57028342a809323348998983" width="499"></strong>
    </div>
    <div><b><br></b>
      <p>What does the point&nbsp;\( (2, 10) \) mean in this graph in relation to the situation?</p>
      <p>Tyler bought 2 T-shirts and 10 pairs of socks for $45.</p>
      <p>What does the point \( (4, 6) \) mean on this graph?&nbsp;</p>
      <p>If Tyler bought 4 T-shirts and 6 pairs of socks, it would cost MORE than $45.</p>
      <h3>Try It: Writing Equations Using Graphs in Situations&nbsp;</h3>
      <p>Use Desmos or a graphing calculator to create a graph for \( 40x +20y = 180 \).&nbsp;</p>
      <p>If \(x\) represents the number of pairs of shoes and \(y\) represents
        the number of pairs of jeans, what is one combination that is a
