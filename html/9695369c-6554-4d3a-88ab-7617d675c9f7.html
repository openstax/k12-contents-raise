<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>In the previous activity, students analyzed and
  interpreted points on a graph relative to an equation and a situation.
  In this activity, they write a linear equation to model a situation, use
  graphing technology to graph the equation, and then use the graph to
  solve problems. Each given situation involves an initial value and a
  constant rate of change.</p>
<p>Before students begin the activity, introduce them to
  the graphing technology available in the classroom. Offer a quick
  tutorial on how to graph equations, adjust the graphing window, and plot
  points. This tutorial could happen independently of the activity as
  long as it precedes the activity.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Give all students access to graphing technology. Tell
  students that in this course they will frequently use technology to
  create a graph that represents an equation and use the graph to solve
  problems.</p>
<p>Demonstrate how to use the technology available in your
  classroom to create and view graphs of equations. Explain how to enter
  equations, adjust the graphing window, and plot a point. If using
  Desmos, please see the digital version of this activity for suggested
  instructions.</p>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2&ndash;4. Assign one
  situation to each group. Ask students to answer the first few questions,
  including writing an equation, and then graph the equation and answer
  the last question.</p><br>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Use the following scenario for questions 1-5:<br>
  A student has a savings account with $475 in it. She deposits $125 of her paycheck into the account every week. Her
  goal is to save $7000 for college.
</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>How much will be in the account after 3 weeks?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> $850</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>How many weeks will it take until she has $1350?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 7 weeks</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Write an equation that represents the relationship between the dollar amount in her account and the number of
    weeks of saving.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(a=475+125w\), where \(a\) is the dollar amount in the account and \(w\) is the number of
  weeks of savings.</p>

  <li>Graph your equation using graphing technology. Mark the points on the graph that represent the amount after 3
    weeks and the week she has $1350. Write down the coordinates.

  </li>
  <li>They all decrease.

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Sample responses:<br>
  The graphs would still be lines with negative slopes that are different. They would have the same horizontal
  intercepts. The vertical intercepts would be different, but they would represent the same amount of water.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select a group that analyzed the first situation and a
  group that analyzed the second situation to share their responses.
  Display their graphs for all to see.</p>
<p>Focus the discussion on two things: what the points on the graph mean and how the graph could be used to answer
  questions about the quantities in each situation. Discuss questions such
  as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;How did
    you find the answers to the first two questions?&rdquo; (By calculation, for
    example, computing \( 475 + 125(3) \), or finding \( 1,\!350 - 475 \),
    and then dividing by 125.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How did
    you find the answer to the last question?&rdquo; (By calculation, for
    instance, finding \( 7,\!000 - 475 \), and then dividing by 125. Or,
    alternatively, by using the graph.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Highlight how
  the graph of the equations could be
  used to answer the questions. If not already mentioned by students,
  discuss how the graph of \( y=475-125x \) can be used to find the
  answers to all the questions about the student&rsquo;s savings account, and
  the graph of \( y=450-20x \) can help us with the questions about
  draining the water tank.</p>
<p>Keep the graphs of the two equations displayed for the lesson summary.</p>

<h4>Writing Equations Using Graphs in Situations </h4>
<p>An equation that contains two unknown quantities or two quantities that vary is called an equation in two variables.
  A solution to such an equation is a pair of numbers that makes the equation true. </p>
  <p><strong>Example</strong><br>
Suppose Tyler spends $45 on T-shirts and socks. A T-shirt costs $10, and a pair of socks costs $2.50. If \(t\)
  represents the number of T-shirts and \(p\) represents the number of pairs of socks that Tyler buys, what is an
  equation that represents the situation?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(10t + 2.50p = 45\) because the cost is $10 per T-shirt (10t) plus $2.50 per pair of socks
  \((2.50p)\), which equals 45. </p>
<p>Examine the graph of the equation 10t + 2.50p = 45. </p>
<img height="355" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/402234f66bee06cb57028342a809323348998983"
  width="499">
<br>
<br>
<p>What does the point \((2, 10)\) mean in this graph in relation to the situation? </p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> If Tyler bought 2 T-shirts and 10 pairs of socks, it costs $45. This is why the point (\(2,
  10)\) is on the line. </p>
<p>What does the point (4, 6) mean on this graph?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> If Tyler bought 4 T-shirts and 6 pairs of socks, it would cost more than $45.</p>
<h4>Try It: Writing Equations Using Graphs in Situations</h4>
<p>Use Desmos or a graphing calculator to create a graph for \( 40x +20y = 180 \).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>If \(x\) represents the number of pairs of shoes and \(y\) represents the number of pairs of jeans, what is one
    combination that is a solution?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here are some examples: \((2, 5)\), \((1, 7)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4,
  1)\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>What does the combination you identified mean on the graph? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is an example: For \((2, 5)\), that means buying 2 pairs of
  shoes and 5 pairs of jeans will cost $180. </p>
<p>This is how to find a solution and determine its meaning:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Find a point on the graph of the line. </li>
  <li>The point \((2, 5)\) is on the graph. Since 2 is the coordinate of the \(x\)-coordinate, it represents 2 pairs of
    shoes. </li>
  <li>Since 5 is the \(y\)-coordinate, it represents 5 pairs of jeans.
  </li>
  <li>The line represents all combinations that equal $180.
  </li>
</ol>
