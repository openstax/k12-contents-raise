<h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>
<p>By now students recognize that solutions to linear inequalities can be found by graphing, and that this can be done by first graphing a related equation and deciding on the solution region. In this lesson, they learn to use graphing technology to find the solution set of a linear inequality in two variables.</p>
<p>Students then use this skill to solve problems that involve inequalities. They write linear inequalities to represent the constraints in situations and then use the representations (including the graphs of the solutions) to answer questions about the situations. As they write inequalities from descriptions, decide on the solution sets, and interpret points in a solution region, students engage in quantitative and abstract reasoning.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h3>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify an inequality, a graph, an ordered pair, and a description that represent the constraints and possible solutions in a situation.</li>
  <li>Explain that a constraint on two variables can be represented by an inequality, a graph (a half-plane), and a verbal description.</li>
  <li>Write inequalities in two variables to represent the constraints in a situation.</li>
  <li>Use technology to graph the solution set to answer questions about the situation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use graphing technology to find the solution to a two-variable inequality.</li>
  <li>Connect the different representations and interpret them in terms of the situation, when given inequalities, graphs, and descriptions that represent the constraints in a situation.</li>
</ul>
