<h2>Warm Up (5 minutes)<br></h2>
</div>
<div class="body">
<p>This Math Talk encourages students to rely on the structure of equations, properties of operations, and what they know about solutions to equations to mentally solve problems. It also prompts students to recall that dividing a number by 0 leads to an undefined result, preparing them for the work later in the lesson. (In that activity, students will consider why dividing by a variable is not considered an acceptable move when writing equivalent equations or solving equations.)</p>
<p>To determine if 0 is a solution to the equations, students could substitute 0 into the expressions and evaluate them. For some equations, however, the answer can be efficiently found by making use of structure. In explaining their strategies, students need to be precise in their word choice and use of language.</p>
</div>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<p>Display one problem at a time. Give students quiet time to think individually for each problem and ask them to give a signal when they have an answer and a strategy. Keep all problems displayed throughout the talk. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>

<h3><span>Student-Facing Statement</span></h3>
<div class="body">
<p>Choose the equations where 0 is a solution.</p>
<p><span class="math math-repaired">\( 4(x + 2) = 10 \)</span></p>
<p><span class="math math-repaired">\( 12 - 8x = 3(x + 4) \)</span></p>
<p><span class="math math-repaired">\( 5x = \frac12 x \)</span></p>
<p><span class="math math-repaired">\( \frac {6}{x} + 1 = 8 \)</span></p>
</div>
<h3>Student Response</h3>
<div class="body">
<ul>
<li>No. For example: If <span class="math math-repaired">\( x=0 \)</span>, then the expression on the left has the value 8, which makes the equation false.</li>
<li>Yes. For example: Substituting 0 for <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span> gives <span class="math math-repaired">\( 12=12 \)</span>, which is true.</li>
<li>Yes. For example: 5 multiplied by 0 is 0, and <span class="math math-repaired">\( \frac12 \)</span> multiplied by 0 is also 0, so the two sides of the equation are equal.</li>
<li>No. For example: Dividing by 0 gives an undefined result, so 1 cannot be added to it to equal 8.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>Ask students to share their strategies for each problem. Record and display their responses for all to see. To involve more students in the conversation, consider asking:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Who can restate <span class="math math-repaired">\( \underline{\hspace{.5in}} \)&rsquo;</span>s reasoning in a different way?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Did anyone have the same strategy but would explain it differently?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Did anyone solve the problem in a different way?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Does anyone want to add on to <span class="math math-repaired">\( \underline{\hspace{.5in}} \)&rsquo;</span>s strategy?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Do you agree or disagree? Why?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<div>
<p><em>Speaking: MLR8 Discussion Supports. </em>Display sentence frames to support students when they explain their strategy. For example, &ldquo;First, I _____ because . . .&rdquo; or &ldquo;I noticed _____, so I . . .&rdquo; Some students may benefit from the opportunity to rehearse what they will say with a partner before they share with the whole class.</p>
