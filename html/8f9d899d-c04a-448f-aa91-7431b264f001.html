<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)<br></h3>
<p>This activity encourages students to rely on the structure of equations, properties of operations, and what they
  know about solutions to equations to mentally solve problems. It also prompts students to recall that dividing a
  number by 0 leads to an undefined result, preparing them for the work later in the lesson. (In that activity, students
  will consider why dividing by a variable is not considered an acceptable move when writing equivalent equations or
  solving equations.)</p>
<p>To determine if 0 is a solution to the equations, students could substitute 0 into the expressions and evaluate them.
  For some equations, however, the answer can be efficiently found by making use of structure. In explaining their
  strategies, students need to be precise in their word choice and use of language.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>This activity can be implemented using a Math Talk protocol:</p>
<p>Display one problem at a time. Give students quiet time to think individually for each problem and ask them to give a
  signal when they have an answer and a strategy. Keep all problems displayed throughout the talk. Follow with a
  whole-class discussion.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li>Is 0 a <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">solution of an equation</span>&nbsp;\( 4(x + 2) = 10 \)?&nbsp;Explain.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No. For example: If \( x=0 \), then the expression on the left has the value 8, which makes the equation false.</p>

  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
    <li>Is 0 a solution for the equation \( 12 - 8x = 3(x + 4) \)?&nbsp;Explain.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. For example: Substituting 0 for&nbsp;\( x \) gives \( 12=12 \), which is true.</p>

  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
    <li>Is 0 a solution for the equation \( 5x = \frac12 x \)?&nbsp;Explain.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. For example: 5 multiplied by 0 is 0, and&nbsp;\( \frac{1}{2} \) multiplied by 0 is also 0, so the two sides of the equation are equal.</p>

    <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
      <li>Is 0 a solution for the equation \( \frac {6}{x} + 1 = 8 \)?&nbsp;Explain.</li>
   </ol>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No. For example: Dividing by 0 gives an undefined result, so it cannot be added by 1 to equal 8.</p>





<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Ask students to share their strategies for each problem. Record and display their responses for all to see. To
  involve more students in the conversation, consider asking:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Who can restate \( \underline{\hspace{.5in}} \)&rsquo;s reasoning
    in a different way?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Did anyone have the same strategy but would explain it differently?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Did anyone solve the problem in a different way?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Does anyone want to add on to \( \underline{\hspace{.5in}}
    \)&rsquo;s strategy?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Do you agree or disagree? Why?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
