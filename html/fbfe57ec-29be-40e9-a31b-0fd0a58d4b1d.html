<h4>Cool Down Activity</h4>
<p>On a family outing, Marlon bought 5 cups of hot cocoa and 4 pretzels for $18.40. Some of his family members would like a second serving, so he went back to the same food stand and bought another 2 cups of hot cocoa and 4 pretzels for $11.20.</p>
<p>Here is a system of equations that represent the quantities and constraints in this situation.</p>
<p>\( \left\{ \begin{array}{c l} 5c + 4p = 18.40\\ 2c + 4p = 11.20 \end{array}\right. \)<br>

<p>The new equation shows the total number of cups of hot cocoa and total number of pretzels on one side, and the total amount Marlon spent on the other side. The price of each cup of hot cocoa and the price of each pretzel haven&rsquo;t changed.</p>

<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t help. For example: It doesn&rsquo;t eliminate a variable. What would help is subtracting the second equation from the first to get 
      \(3c=7.20\). Then we can find \(c\) and solve for \(p\).</p>
