<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:<br></p>
<ul>
  <li>Describe the connections between an equation of the form \(ax+by=c\) , the features of its graph, and the rate of change in the situation.</li>
  <li>Graph a linear equation of the form \(ax+by=c\) .</li>
  <li>Demonstrate that rewriting the equation for a line in different forms can make it easier to find certain kinds of information about the relationship and about the graph.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Here are the <strong>activities </strong>that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1.10.1 Interpreting Equations in Context&nbsp;
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you explained how equations matched given situations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1.10.2&nbsp; Graphing Equations in Context
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you used a graph of an equation to look at possible solutions to the situation.</li>
  </li>
  <li>1.10.2 Self Check&nbsp;</li>
  <li>1.10.2 Additional Resources&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>

  <li>1.10.3 Writing and Graphing Equations in Standard Form
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you explored writing and graphing equations in standard form. You then worked on solving the equations for \(y\) and recognized where the slope and y-intercept are located in the new equations.</li>
  </li>
  <li>1.10.3 Self Check&nbsp;</li>
  <li>1.10.3 Additional Resources&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>

  <li>1.10.4 Matching Equations and Graphs
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you wrote an equation to represent the number of rides and games that Kiran could do and matched the graph to this equation given the amount he could spend.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1.10.5: Practice</li>
  <li>1.11.6: Lesson Summary</li>
</ul>
