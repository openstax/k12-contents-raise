<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Encourage and support opportunities for peer interactions. Invite students to talk about their ideas with a partner before writing them down.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>

  <li>Find the coordinates of two other points on the graph. The points should be symmetric across the vertex. Show your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \((0,11)\) and \((6,11)\). When \(x\) is 0, the value of \(y\) is \((-3)^2+2\) or 11. The other point is 3 units to the right of the vertex with the same \(y\)-coordinate.</p>

  <li>Use the graphing tool or technology outside the course. Draw a graph that represents the equation \(y=(x&minus;3)^2+2\).</li>

<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>Points to Emphasize</h5>
<p>Use student work from this cool down (or think-aloud, if student work does not show these strategies) to demonstrate finding the \(y\)-intercept or other key points on the graph that would make graphing easier.</p>
