<h3>Student Readiness for Unit 6</h3>
<p>To be ready for this unit, students will need to be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Simplify expressions with exponents. </li>
  <li> Simplify expressions using the Distributive Property. </li>
  <li> Find the greatest common factor (GCF) of two or more numbers. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Vertical Alignment for Unit 6</h3>
<p>What is vertical alignment? You may be familiar with aligning your math lesson to a set of standards. But what does TEA mean when they discuss the importance of vertical alignment? Vertical alignment documents the progression of learning from grade level to grade level.</p>
<p>Students learn many different sets of knowledge and skills related to mathematics that build upon each other. Understanding this progression of learning across the curriculum continuum provides teachers and administrators the ability to better support mathematical conceptual and skill-based development.</p>
<p>As a teacher, understanding the TEKS mathematical vertical alignment will help you better understand what your students have already mastered and how what you are teaching them will be critical for mastery in future learning opportunities.</p>
<p>For Algebra I teachers, we recommend using the Texas Education Agency&rsquo;s <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c1d455b65dade9bf6cba34312c3742132cb76c48" target="_blank">TEKS Vertical Alignment Chart Grades 5 through Algebra 1 and Algebra 2</a>. To understand how to read and use the Vertical Alignment chart, watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1xp5nd44Eg" target="_blank">introductory video</a>.</p>
<p>Watch this video walkthrough of using the vertical alignment to better understand your students&rsquo; readiness for learning new content in each unit of RAISE.</p>

<h3>Pre-Algebra Resources from OpenStax</h3>
<p>As you work with individual students and find gaps in their prior learning, one source that you can pull remedial or reinforcing content from is the <a href="https://openstax.org/details/books/prealgebra-2e">OpenStax Pre-Algebra</a> textbook.</p>
<ul>
  <li> 2.1 Use the Language of Algebra </li>
  <li> 2.2 Evaluate, Simplify, and Translate Expressions </li>
  <li> 2.3 Solving Equations Using the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality </li>
  <li> 3.5 Solve Equations Using Integers; The Division Property of Equality </li>
  <li> 4.7 Solve Equations with Fractions </li>
  <li> 5.4 Solve Equations with Decimals </li>
  <li> 6.5 Solve Proportions and their Applications </li>
  <li> 7.3 Distributive Property </li>
  <li> 8.1 Solve Equations Using the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality </li>
  <li> 8.2 Solve Equations Using the Division and Multiplication Properties of Equality </li>
  <li> 8.3 Solve Equations with Variables and Constants on Both Sides </li>
  <li> 8.4 Solve Equations with Fraction or Decimal Coefficients </li>
  <li> 9.7 Solve a Formula for a Specific Variable </li>
</ul>

<h3>English Language Proficiency Standards (ELPS)</h3>
<p>Throughout each unit, we have provided a core sampling of teaching strategies that align to the <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4e39322c11e6d04360f2bc22cf16e43c9b80e05e" target="_blank">English Language Proficiency Standards</a>. The alignments are not intended to be all inclusive. They are to demonstrate a sampling of ways to support English language learners within the math classroom. Each lesson offers ELPS aligned to at least three different domains and across the entire unit, all five ELPS domains are represented and aligned. You can pull these strategies for learning, listening, speaking, reading, and writing for any of the lessons. To see examples of teaching routines for each standard, please view the Teacher Guide for Course Level Resources.</p>
<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
