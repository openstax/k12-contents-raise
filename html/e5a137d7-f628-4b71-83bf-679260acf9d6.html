<p>In this unit, students will:</p>
<ul>
<li> Add, subtract, multiply and divide polynomials of degree one and degree two. </li>
<li> Rewrite polynomial expressions using the distributive property. </li>
<li> Factor trinomials in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\), including perfect square trinomials of degree two, and factor binomials that are the difference of two squares. </li>
</ul>
<p>To accomplish these unit-level learning goals, students will complete the following lessons and activities.</p>
