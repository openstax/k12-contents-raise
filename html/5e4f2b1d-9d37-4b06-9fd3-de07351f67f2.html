<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Explain using graphs, tables, or calculations that exponential functions eventually grow faster than quadratic functions. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li> 7.4.1: Comparing Expressions </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you compared exponential expressions and ordered them from least to greatest by reasoning about the base numbers and exponents. </li>
</ul>
<li> 7.4.2: Exploring Linear, Exponential, and Quadratic Growth </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you examined patterns and then determined expressions that represented the patterns. You then determined if each expression was linear, exponential, or quadratic. </li>
<li> 7.4.2: Self Check </li>
<li> 7.4.2: Additional Resources </li>
</ul>
<li> 7.4.3: Comparing Exponential and Quadratic Functions </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you compared an exponential function and a quadratic function through their tables of values and graphs. You then determined which function had a larger value as the \(x\)-values increased. </li>
<li> 7.4.3: Self Check </li>
<li> 7.4.3: Additional Resources </li>
</ul>
<li> 7.4.4: Comparing Exponential and Quadratic Expressions </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you determined the point at which a particular exponential function is always greater than a particular quadratic function. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>

<li> 7.4.5: Practice </li>
