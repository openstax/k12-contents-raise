<h4>Activity </h4>
<p>Here are graphs representing two functions and descriptions of two functions.</p>
<p><img alt="Graph of two exponential functions, origin O. time(months) and area (square inches).&nbsp;" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/237fcb3d1edcb64896c0d0a8d4d1e94d10b8871e"></p>
<ul>
  <li> Function \(f\): The area of a wall that is covered by Mold A, in square inches, doubling every month. </li>
  <li> Function \(g\): The area of a wall that is covered by Mold B, in square inches, tripling every month. </li>
</ul>

  <p>Compare your answer:</p>
  <p>Since Mold B is growing more quickly, the graph that shows a greater growth factor (the one starting lower and ending higher) is function \(g\) (solid). </p>
