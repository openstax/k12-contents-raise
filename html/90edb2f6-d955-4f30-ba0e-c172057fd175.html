<p><strong><em>Students will complete the following questions to practice the skills they have learned in this lesson.</em></strong></p>
<p>For questions 1-4, use the following passage:</p>
<p>Harrison works two part time jobs. One at a gas station that pays $11 an hour and the other is IT troubleshooting for $16.50 an hour. Between the two jobs, Harrison wants to earn at least $330 a week. How many hours does Harrison need to work at each job to earn at least $330?</p>
<p>1. Let x be the number of hours he works at the gas station and let y be the number of (hours he works troubleshooting. Write an inequality that would model this situation.</p>
<ol>
  <li>\(11x + 16.5y &ge; 330\)</li>
  <li>\(16.5x + 11y &ge; 330\)</li>
  <li>\(11x + 16.5y &le; 330\)</li>
  <li>\(16.5y + 11x &gt; 330\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> \(11x + 16.5y &ge; 330\)</p>
