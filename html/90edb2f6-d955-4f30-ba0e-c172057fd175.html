<p class="os-raise-text-bold"><em>Students will complete the following questions to practice the skills they have learned in this lesson.</em></p>
<p>For questions 1-4, use the following passage:</p>
<p>Harrison works two part time jobs. One at a gas station that pays $11 an hour and the other is IT troubleshooting for $16.50 an hour. Between the two jobs, Harrison wants to earn at least $330 a week. How many hours does Harrison need to work at each job to earn at least $330?</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Let \(x\) be the number of hours he works at the gas station and let \(y\) be the number of (hours he works troubleshooting. Write an inequality that would model this situation.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>\(11x + 16.5y &ge; 330\)</li>
  <li>\(16.5x + 11y &ge; 330\)</li>
