<h4>Try It: Correlation Coefficient</h4>
<p><span>The scatter plot below displays data on the number of defects per 100 cars and a measure of customer satisfaction (on a scale from 1 to 1,000, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction) for the 33 brands of cars sold in the United States in 2009.</span><br></p>

    <p>Which of the following is the value of the correlation coefficient for this data set: \(r = -0.95\), \(r = -0.24\), \(r = 0.83\), or \(r = 1.00\)? Explain why you selected this value.</p>

  <p>There is not a strong pattern of a linear relationship with this scatter plot. Even though there is a weak relationship, there is a general pattern that as the number of defects increases, the satisfaction rating tends to decrease. As a result, the value of \(r\) is negative and close to zero. Based on the values provided, the best estimate is \(r = -0.24\).</p>
