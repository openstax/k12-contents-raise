<p>To help students summarize the skills they learned dividing polynomials, emphasize the following points:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Divide monomials by monomials by dividing the coefficients and then dividing the variables using the Quotient Property for exponents. </li>
  <li> Divide a polynomial by a monomial by distributing the division of the monomial to each term in the polynomial dividend. </li>
  <li> The solution to your division problem can alway be checked by multiplying the solution by the divisor to see if the product matches the original dividend. </li>
  <li> To divide a polynomial by another polynomial, use long division as you have previously learned using numbers. </li>
  <li> An efficient method to divide a polynomial by a binomial is synthetic division. </li>
  <ul>
    <li> The divisor must be in the form \(x - c\), where \(c\) is a constant. </li>
    <li> Use a placeholder with a \(0\) coefficient, such as \(0x^2\), for any term that is missing in the dividend from the term with the highest degree down to a degree of \(0\). </li>
    <li> The bottom-right number in the third row of the synthetic division is the remainder. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> Polynomial functions can be divided using the same methods as with other polynomials. </li>
  <li> Use the Remainder Theorem to easily find the value of a remainder in any polynomial division problem. </li>
  <li> Use the Factor Theorem to determine if a divisor is a factor of a larger polynomial. </li>
</ul>
