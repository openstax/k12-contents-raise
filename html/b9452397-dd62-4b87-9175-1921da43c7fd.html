<h4>Connecting Representations of Inequalities&nbsp;</h4>
<p> In order to connect the constraints of a situation with an inequality, its graph, and possible solutions, we need a mastery of each representation.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Christy sells her photographs at a booth at a street fair. Each small photo she displays costs her $4 and each large photo costs her $10. She doesn&rsquo;t want to spend more than $200 on photos to display.</p>
<p>Let \( x \) be the number of small photos and \( y \) be the number of large photos that Christy displays.</p>
<p>We know that each small photo costs $4 to display and each large photo costs $10. We also know that she doesn&rsquo;t want to spend more than $200.</p>
<p>The inequality that represents this situation is \( 4x + 10y &le; 200 \).</p>
<p>To be able to connect this inequality with possible solutions, translating it into a graph is an important step.</p>

    <p>No; the ordered pair \((15, 15)\) does not fall within the region representing the solution. Another way to verify this is by using the inequality.</p>
    <p>\( \begin{eqnarray} 4x + 10y &le; 200 \\ 4(15) + 10(15) \leq 200 \\60 + 150 \leq 200\\210 \nleq 200 \end{eqnarray} \)</p>
    <p>Since $210 is not less than $200, 15 small paintings and 15 large paintings does not stay with Christy&rsquo;s budget of $200.</p>
