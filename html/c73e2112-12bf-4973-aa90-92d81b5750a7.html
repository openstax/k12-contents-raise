<h4>Lesson Narrative<br></h4>
<p>This is the first of two lessons where students write equations to model various situations. The work here progresses
  in two ways&mdash;in terms of the complexity of the relationships and in terms of the amount of scaffolding built into
  the prompts.</p>
<p>Students begin by revisiting ways to calculate a given percentage of a given number, in preparation for computations
  they&rsquo;ll need to do in the lesson. Then, they look at a geometric context where three quantities can be related
  by addition and subtraction. Next, they look at a couple of contexts on spending, earning, and sales tax, which
  involve using multiplication, using multiplication and addition, and increasing a number by a percentage.</p>
<p>In each case, students begin by creating models where the values of the quantities are known (or mostly known) and
  move toward models where the quantities are unknown or can change. The repeated reasoning allows students to practice
  looking for and expressing regularity. As they interpret verbal descriptions and write equations, students develop
  their understanding of equations as a way to represent constraints and practice reasoning quantitatively and
  abstractly.<br></p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify quantities that vary and quantities that don&rsquo;t, given a description of a situation or an equation.
  </li>
  <li>Explain that letters can be used to represent both quantities that vary and those that are constant.</li>
  <li>Write equations with numbers and variables to describe relationships and constraints.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Tell which quantities in a situation can vary and which ones cannot.</li>
  <li>Use letters and numbers to write equations representing the relationships in a situation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Support for English Language Learners</p>
    <p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.
  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p>
<ul>
  <li>ELPS 1(E) internalize new basic and academic language by using and reusing it in meaningful ways in speaking and
    writing activities that build concept and language attainment
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audio tape, video, DVD, and CD- ROM to build
    and reinforce concept and language attainment
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(B) expand and internalize initial English vocabulary by learning and using high-frequency English words
    necessary for identifying and describing people, places, and objects, by retelling simple stories and basic
    information represented or supported by pictures, and by learning and using routine language needed for classroom
    communication
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(D) speak using grade-level content area vocabulary in context to internalize new English words and build
    academic language proficiency
  </li>
  <li>ELPS 4(E) read linguistically accommodated content area material with a decreasing need for linguistic accommodations
    as more English is learned
  </li>
</ul>
