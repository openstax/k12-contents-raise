<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Explain the connections between an equation and a graph that represents exponential growth. </li>
  <li> Write and interpret an equation that represents exponential growth. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 5.4.1: Exponent Rules </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you reviewed the basic properties of simplifying exponents and practiced their use. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 5.4.2: Zero Exponent Rule </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you focused on zero as an exponent. You looked at patterns in exponents to determine the value of zero as an exponent and applied the basic rules of exponents with zero. </li>
  <li>5.4.2: Self Check</li>
  <li>5.4.2: Additional Resources</li>
  </ul>
  <li> 5.4.3: Exponential Change: The Growth Factor </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you learned to continue the exponential growth tables to the equations of the form \(y=a\cdot b^x\). </li>
  <li>5.4.3: Self Check</li>
  <li>5.4.3: Additional Resources</li>

  </ul>
  <li> 5.4.4: Graphing Exponential Expressions </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you continued working with the multiple representations of exponential functions. During this activity, you expanded upon the table that was created in 5.4.3 and represented it in a graph. </li>
  <li>5.4.4: Self Check</li>
  <li>5.4.4: Additional Resources</li>
  </ul>
  <li> 5.4.5: Interpret the Growth Factor of the Equation </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you analyzed all of the parts of an exponential equation and what they meant in the context of a problem. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 5.4.6: Practice </li>
</ul>
