<h4>Activity (10 Minutes)</h4>
<p>A discrete function has distinct separate values in the domain and range, rather than an interval of values.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Below is a graph from the previous lesson that graphs the number of students attending a camp and the amount, in dollars, the camp earns. There must be 5 students to hold the camp.</li>

<p>A continuous function refers to a function that does not have any breaks in its graph. The domain and range of a continuous function are often represented by an interval that can be written as an inequality.</p>
<ol start="2">
  <li>The graph below represents a continuous function. The function, \(P\), is the cost of parking in a garage for \(t\) hours. It is represented by the function \(P(t)=5h +10\).</li>

        <p>That&rsquo;s correct! Check yourself: The lowest \(x\)-value is 2, and the graph continues forever right. The lowest \(y\)-value is 3, and then the graph continues forever up.</p>

        <p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: Watch the inequality symbol you use. The domain includes the \(x\)-values greater than or equal to 2, and the range includes the \(y\)-values greater than or equal to 3. The answer is Domain: \(x\geq2\) and Range: \(y\geq3\).</p>

      <td>
        <p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: The domain includes 2 and the range includes 3, so both inequalities should have an equal sign included. The answer is Domain: \(x\geq2\) and Range: \(y\geq3\)</p>

<h4> Domain and Range as Inequalities</h4>
<p>Looking at the linear function below, use inequalities to represent the domain and range.</p>
<p><img alt="GRAPH OF A LINE FOR ALL X GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 5, WITH POINT SHOWN AT (5, 0), AND PASSING THROUGH THE POINTS (10, 5), AND (15, 10).

<p>Domain:</p>
<p>Since the domain is all \(x\)-values, look left to right for the least to greatest values.</p>
<p>The smallest \(x\)-value on this linear function is 5, and then the line continues to the right forever.</p>
<p>So, the domain is all values that are at least 5.</p>
<p>As an inequality, write this as \(x\geq5\).</p>
<p>Range:</p>
<p>Since the range is all \(y\)-values, look from the bottom to the top for the least to greatest values.</p>
<p>The smallest \(y\)-value is 0, and then the line continues up forever.</p>
<p>So, the range is all values that are at least 0.</p>
<p>An an inequality, the range is \(y\geq0\).</p>

<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to write the domain and range of the linear function as an inequality:</p>
<p>Domain:</p>
<p>Since the domain is all \(x\)-values, look left to right for the least to greatest values.</p>
<p>The smallest \(x\)-value on this linear function is 5, and then the line continues to the right forever.</p>
<p>So, the domain is all values that are at least 5.</p>
<p>As an inequality, write this as \(x\geq5\).</p>
<p>Range:</p>
<p>Since the range is all \(y\)-values, look from the bottom to the top for the least to greatest values.</p>
<p>The smallest \(y\)-value is 6, and then the line continues up forever.</p>
<p>So, the range is all values that are at least 6.</p>
<p>An an inequality, the range is \(y\geq6\).</p>
