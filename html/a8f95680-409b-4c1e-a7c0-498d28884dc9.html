<p>A discrete function has distinct separate values in the domain and range, rather than an interval of values.</p>

<li>Below is a graph from the previous lesson that graphs the number of students attending a camp and the amount, in dollars, the camp earns. There must be 5 students to hold the camp.</li>

<li> What are the \(x\)-values of this function that make up the domain? </li>

<li> Why can’t we say the domain is all values from 5 to 16? </li>
</ol>
<p> <strong>Answer: </strong>the number of students cannot be fractions or decimals, so those values are not in the domain.</p>

<p>A continuous function refers to a function that does not have any breaks in its graph. The domain and range of a continuous function are often represented by an interval that can be written as an inequality.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li>The graph below represents a continuous function. The function, \(P\), is the cost of parking in a garage for \(t\) hours. It is represented by the function \(P(t)=5h +10\).</li>

<p>Incorrect. Let’s try again a different way: The domain is the \(x\)-values. and the lowest \(x\)-value is 2. Domain: \(x\geq2\) and Range: \(y\geq3\).</p>

<p>Domain: \(x\geq2\)</p>

<p>That’s correct! Check yourself: The lowest \(x\)-value is 2, and the graph continues forever right. The lowest \(y\)-value is 3, and then the graph continues forever up.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p>Domain: \(x\leq2\)</p>
<p>Range: \(y\leq3\)</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Incorrect. Let’s try again a different way: Watch the inequality symbol you use. The domain includes the \(x\)-values greater than or equal to 2, and the range includes the \(y\)-values greater than or equal to 3. The answer is Domain: \(x\geq2\) and Range: \(y\geq3\).</p>

<p>Domain: \(x &gt; 2\)</p>
<p>Range: \(y &gt; 3\)</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Incorrect. Let’s try again a different way: The domain includes 2 and the range includes 3, so both inequalities should have an equal sign included. The answer is Domain: \(x\geq2\) and Range: \(y\geq3\)</p>

<h4> Domain and Range as Inequalities</h4>
<p>Looking at the linear function below, use inequalities to represent the domain and range.</p>
<p><img alt="Graph of a line for all x greater than or equal to 5, with point shown at (5, 0), and passing through the points (10, 5), and (15, 10)." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/12d788f0be52aef294188ce1d62b5406230e279f" width="300"/></p>
<p>Domain:</p>
<p>Since the domain is all \(x\)-values, look left to right for the least to greatest values.</p>
<p>The smallest \(x\)-value on this linear function is 5, and then the line continues to the right forever.</p>
<p>So, the domain is all values that are at least 5.</p>
<p>As an inequality, write this as \(x\geq5\).</p>
<p>Range:</p>
<p>Since the range is all \(y\)-values, look from the bottom to the top for the least to greatest values.</p>
<p>The smallest \(y\)-value is 0, and then the line continues up forever.</p>
<p>So, the range is all values that are at least 0.</p>
<p>An an inequality, the range is \(y\geq0\).</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Here is how to write the domain and range of the linear function as an inequality:</p>
<p>Domain:</p>
<p>Since the domain is all \(x\)-values, look left to right for the least to greatest values.</p>
<p>The smallest \(x\)-value on this linear function is 5, and then the line continues to the right forever.</p>
<p>So, the domain is all values that are at least 5.</p>
<p>As an inequality, write this as \(x\geq5\).</p>
<p>Range:</p>
<p>Since the range is all \(y\)-values, look from the bottom to the top for the least to greatest values.</p>
<p>The smallest \(y\)-value is 6, and then the line continues up forever.</p>
<p>So, the range is all values that are at least 6.</p>
<p>An an inequality, the range is \(y\geq6\).</p>
