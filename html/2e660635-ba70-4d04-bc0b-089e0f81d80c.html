<p>Here is how to determine which value is greater:</p>
<p>Looking at the graph, \(f(1)\) is where \(x=1\) reaches the graph of \(f(x)\). The \(y\)-value there is 4. So, \(f(1)=4\).</p>
<p>Similarly, \(g(1)\) is where \(x=1\) reaches the graph of \(g(x)\). The \(y\)-value there is 2.</p>
<p>So, \(f(1) &gt;g(1)\).</p>
