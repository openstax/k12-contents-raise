<p>In this unit, students will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Decide whether relations define a function and evaluate functions expressed in function notation.</li>
  <li>Graph linear functions on the coordinate plane and identify key features, identify transformations of the parent function \(f(x)=x\), and represent domain and range using inequalities for real-world situations.
  </li>
  <li>Identify terms of arithmetic and geometric sequences and write a formula for the nth term of arithmetic and geometric sequences, given the value of several of their terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>To accomplish these unit-level learning goals, students will complete the following lessons and activities.</p>
