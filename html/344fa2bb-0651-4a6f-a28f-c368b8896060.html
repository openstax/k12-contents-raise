<h3>Unit 4 Overview</h3>
<p>In this unit, students will:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Decide whether relations define a function and evaluate functions expressed in function notation. </li>
  <li> Graph linear functions on the coordinate plane and identify key features, identify transformations of the parent function \(f(x)=x\), and represent domain and range using inequalities for real-world situations. </li>
  <li> Identify terms of arithmetic and geometric sequences and write a formula for the nth term of arithmetic and geometric sequences, given the value of several of their terms. </li>

<h3>Student Readiness for Unit 4</h3>
<p>To be ready for this unit, students will need to be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Find the slope of the line that goes through two points on a graph. </li>
  <li> Interpret the meaning of a situation from a graph. </li>
  <li> Use a pattern to find the next term in a sequence. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Vertical Alignment for Unit 4</h3>
<p>What is vertical alignment? You may be familiar with aligning your math lesson to a set of standards. But what does TEA mean when they discuss the importance of vertical alignment? Vertical alignment documents the progression of learning from grade level to grade level.</p>
<p>Students learn many different sets of knowledge and skills related to mathematics that build upon each other. Understanding this progression of learning across the curriculum continuum provides teachers and administrators the ability to better support mathematical conceptual and skill-based development.</p>
<p>As a teacher, understanding the TEKS mathematical vertical alignment will help you better understand what your students have already mastered and how what you are teaching them will be critical for mastery in future learning opportunities.</p>
<p>For Algebra I teachers, we recommend using the Texas Education Agency&rsquo;s TEKS Vertical Alignment Chart Grades 5 through Algebra 1 and Algebra 2.</p>
<p>Watch this video walkthrough of using the vertical alignment to better understand your students&rsquo; readiness for learning new content in each unit of RAISE.</p>
<p>[ INSERT VIDEO HERE EMBED vertical video from media]</p>
<h3>Pre-Algebra Resources from OpenStax</h3>
<p>As you work with individual students and find gaps in their prior learning, one source that you can pull remedial or reinforcing content from is the OpenStax Pre-Algebra textbook.</p>
<ul>
  <li> 9.1 Use a Problem Solving Strategy </li>
</ul>
<h3>English Language Proficiency Standards (ELPS) </h3>
<p>Throughout each unit, we have provided a core sampling of teaching strategies that align to the English Language Proficiency Standards. The alignments are not intended to be all inclusive. They are to demonstrate the variety of ways that you can support English language learners in the math classroom. Each lesson will have at least three different domains aligned and the entire unit will have all five ELPS domains aligned. You can pull these strategies for learning, listening, speaking, reading, and writing for any of the lessons. To see examples of teaching routines for each standard, please view the Teacher Guide for Course Level Resources.</p>
<p>Support for English Language Learners</p>
<p>To accomplish these unit-level learning goals, students will complete the following lessons and activities.</p>
