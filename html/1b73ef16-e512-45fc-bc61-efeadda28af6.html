<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>Previously, students interpreted given inequalities and made sense of them in terms of a situation. In this activity, students write inequalities to represent the constraints in a situation. Students identify key quantities and relationships and think about ways to represent them. In doing so, they engage in an aspect of mathematical modeling.</p>
<p>As students work, look for those who represent the same constraint using different inequalities or equations. For example, to represent the total weight that the elevator could carry, some students may write \( w&le;1,500 \), some may write \( 1,500&ge;w \), and others may write \( w&lt;1,500 \) or \( w=1,500 \). Ask students with contrasting statements to share their responses later.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Keep students in groups of 2.<br>
</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>An elevator car in a skyscraper can hold at most 15 people. For safety reasons, each car can carry a maximum of 1,500 kg. On average, an adult weighs 70 kg and a child weighs 35 kg. Assume that each person carries 4 kg of gear with them.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Write as many equations and inequalities as you can think of to represent the constraints in this situation. Be sure to specify the meaning of any letters that you use. (Avoid using the letters \(z\), \(m\), or \(g\).)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here are some samples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\( p &le; 15 \), where \( p \) represents the number of people in an elevator car</li>
  <li>\( a + c &le; 15 \), where \( a \) represents the number of adults and \( c \) represents the number of children in an elevator car.</li>
  <li>\( w &le; 1,500 \), where \( w \) represents the weight in kilograms in one elevator car.</li>
  <li>\( w = 70a + 35c + 4a + 4c \)</li>
  <li>\( 70a + 35c + 4a + 4c &le; 1,500 \)</li>
  <li>\( 74a + 39c &le; 1,500 \)</li>
</ul>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>After you have finished the following tasks, explain the adjustments you made to the equations and inequalities so that they are communicated more clearly. </li>
</ol>
<p>Trade your work with a partner and read each other’s equations and inequalities.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explain to your partner what you think their statements mean, and listen to their explanation of yours.</li>
  <li>Make adjustments to your equations and inequalities so that they are communicated more clearly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answers will vary.</p>

</ol>
<ul>
  <li>n elevator car can hold at most \(z\) people </li>

  <li>each person carries \(d\) kg of gear</li>

<h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>
<p>Students who use a variable for the number of adults and another for the number of children may have trouble accounting for the weight of the gear because it applies to both groups. Calculating the weight of a specific combination of adults and children (with their gear) may help.<br>
</p>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>Invite students to share their equations and inequalities, starting with those that are more concrete (from the first question) and ending with the ones that are more abstract (from the last question).</p>
<p>Emphasize that the same constraints may be accurately represented by statements of different forms. Consider reading aloud the different inequalities that represent the same constraint. For example, if \( w \) represents the total weight:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\( w&le;1,500 \) can be read: &ldquo;The total weight is less than or equal to 1,500 kilograms&rdquo; or &ldquo;The total weight is at most 1,500 kilograms.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>\( 1,500&ge;w \) can be read: &ldquo;Fifteen hundred kilograms is greater than or equal to the total weight.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>\( w&lt;1,500 \) or \( w=1,500 \) can be read: &ldquo;The total weight is less than 1,500 kilograms, or it is equal to 1,500 kilograms.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>For constraints that involve multiple quantities, some students may write, for instance, \( 74a+39c&le;1,500 \), while others may write \( 70a+4a+35c+4c&le;1,500 \). Ask students why these expressions are equivalent, encouraging them to use the context in their explanation.&nbsp;Point out that although a constraint can be written in different ways, writing it using fewer terms may be more convenient and may allow us to gain certain insights about the situation.</p>

<h4>Applications with Linear Inequalities&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Many real-life situations require us to solve inequalities. The method we will use to solve applications with linear inequalities is very much like the one we used when we solved applications with equations.</p>
<p>We will read the problem and make sure all the words are understood. Next, we will identify what we are looking for and assign a variable to represent it. We will restate the problem in one sentence to make it easy to translate into an inequality.</p>
<p><strong>Example&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Dawn won a mini-grant of $4,000 to buy tablet computers for her classroom. The tablets she would like to buy cost $254.12 each, including tax and delivery. Write an inequality to represent the maximum number of tablets Dawn can buy.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Read the problem. </p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Identify what you are looking for. <br>
  the maximum number of tablets Dawn can buy </p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Name what you are looking for. </p>
<p> Choose a variable to represent that quantity. <br>
  Let \( n= \) the number of tablets. </p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Translate. Write a sentence that gives the information to find it. </p>
<p> $254.12 times the number of tablets is no more than $4,000.<br>
  Translate into an inequality.<br>
  \( 254.12n &le; 4000 \)</p>
