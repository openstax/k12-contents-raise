<p>In this lesson, you will learn about the zero product property. You will use it to reason about the solutions to quadratic equations that each have a quadratic expression in factored form on one side and 0 on the other side.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> Explain the meaning of the "zero product property."</li>
<li> Find solutions to quadratic equations when one side is a product of factors and the other side is zero. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
