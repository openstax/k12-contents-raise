<p>Here are three patterns of dots.</p>
<p>Pattern A</p>
<p><img alt="Four steps of a growing pattern. Step 0 is blank. Step 1: 2 dots, one atop the other. Step 2: 4 dots, 2 in row 1 and 2 in row 2. Step 3: 6 dots, 3 dots on row 1 and 3 dots on row 2." height="96" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/194e1b67c3ffd41194a6988591af6534b3030885" width="365"></p>

  <p>Compare your answer:</p>
  <p>Pattern B shows a quadratic relationship.&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li> The number of dots is the step number squared plus 1, or \(n^2+1\). </li>
    <li> Pattern A is growing linearly. It is growing by 2 each time. Pattern C is growing by a factor of 3 each time, so it is growing exponentially. </li>
    <li> Pattern B is growing by 1, then by 3, and then by 5, which is the pattern we saw in other examples of quadratic relationships in the lesson. </li>
  </ul>
