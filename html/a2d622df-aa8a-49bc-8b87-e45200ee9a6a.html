<p>The goal of this discussion is for students to make connections between bivariate data, a linear model, and the context of the data.</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;How do you represent bivariate numerical data? How do you represent bivariate categorical data?&rdquo; (You could use a two-way table for categorical data and a scatter plot for numerical data.)<br><br></li>
  <li>&ldquo;Why is creating a linear model useful?&rdquo; (A linear model allows us to make predictions for the data in a range near the given data. It also helps describe the relationship between the two variables quantitatively.)<br><br></li>
  <li>&ldquo;What are some situations in which you have encountered a scatter plot or a line of best fit previously? What is the meaning of the slope and vertical intercept of the line of best fit in this context?&rdquo; (In science class, we graphed the relationship between the temperature and the time it took for a reaction to take place. The slope represents how much the reaction time changes, on average, for each unit increase in temperature. The vertical intercept represents the reaction time when the temperature is 0.)</li>
