<h3>Activity</h3>
<p>To help pay for his tuition, a college student plans to work in the evenings and on weekends. He has been offered two part-time jobs: working in the guest-services department at a hotel and waiting tables at a popular restaurant.</p>
<ul>
<li>The job at the hotel pays <span>$</span>18 an hour and offers $33 in transportation allowance per month.</li>
<li>The job at the restaurant pays <span>$</span>7.50 an hour plus tips. The entire wait staff typically collects about $50 in tips each hour. Tips are divided equally among the 4 wait staff members who share a shift.</li>
</ul>

<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-b206ce7a-7fff-7fef-47e5-0e0d144ada1e">Inequality 1 shows the pay at the hotel \( (18h+33) \) being greater than the pay at the restaurant \( 7.50h+ \frac{50}{4} \). Earlier, we found out that the hotel job is better when the student works less than 16.5 hours. Graph B shows \( h&lt;16.5 \). This means Graph B shows the solution to Inequality 1.</span></li>
<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-b206ce7a-7fff-7fef-47e5-0e0d144ada1e">If we substitute a value greater than 16.5 for \( h \), we have a true statement for Inequality 2 and a false statement for Inequality 1.
