<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity represents the culmination of all of the factoring strategies learned in the unit. Polynomials are given with no context. Students must determine the type of polynomial, choose the correct strategy to implement, and then correctly factor each polynomial.</p>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<p>Allow students to work with a partner to answer questions 1&ndash;7 in the activity. This will encourage discussion and teamwork as they select the correct strategy and factor each polynomial.</p>
<h4>Student Activity </h4>
<p>Work with a partner on these problems. After each solution, discuss if there are multiple strategies that would work to factor the polynomial.</p>
<p>Find a strategy that fits and factor completely:&nbsp;</p>

  </li>
</ol>
<h4> Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Pose the following question to students:</p>
<ul>
  <li> If more than one strategy can be correctly implemented to factor a polynomial, is there an incorrect choice? (As long as you factor a polynomial down to its prime factors, you have correctly factored the polynomial. Sometimes more than one strategy will work.) </li>
</ul>

<h4>Implementing General Strategies for Factoring</h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s practice recognizing and implementing these strategies as we factor polynomials.</p>
<p>Remember, a polynomial is completely factored if, other than monomials, its factors are prime!</p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLE 1</strong></p>
<p>Find a strategy that fits and factor completely: \(7x^3 &minus; 21x^2 &minus; 70x\).</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Is there a GCF?<br>
  \(7x^3 &minus; 21x^2 &minus; 70x\)<br>
  Yes, \(7x\).</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Factor out the GCF.<br>
  \(7x(x^2 &minus; 3x &minus; 10)\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  In the parentheses, is it a binomial, a trinomial, or are there more than three terms?<br>
  Trinomial with leading coefficient \(1\).</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  &ldquo;Undo&rdquo; FOIL.<br>
  \(7x(x \;\;\; )(x \;\;\; )\)<br>
  \(7x(x + 2)(x &minus; 5)\)</p>
<p>Step 5<br>
  Is the expression factored completely?&nbsp;<br>
  Yes. Neither binomial can be factored.</p>
<p>Step 6<br>
  Check your answer by multiplying.<br>
  \(7x(x + 2)(x &minus; 5)\)<br>
  \(7x(x^2 &minus; 5x + 2x &minus; 10)\)<br>
  \(7x(x^2 &minus; 3x &minus; 10)\)<br>
  \(7x^3 &minus; 21x^2 &minus; 70x&checkmark;\)</p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLE 2</strong></p>
<p>Find a strategy that fits and factor completely: \(4x^2 + 8bx &minus; 4ax &minus; 8ab\).</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Is there a GCF?<br>
  \(4x^2 + 8bx &minus; 4ax &minus; 8ab\)<br>
  Factor out the GCF, \(4\).<br>
  \(4(x^2 + 2bx &minus; ax &minus; 2ab)\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  There are four terms. Use grouping.<br>
  \(4 \lbrack x(x + 2b) &minus; a(x + 2b) \rbrack\)<br>
  \(4(x + 2b)(x &minus; a)\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Is the expression factored completely?<br>
  Yes.</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  Check your answer by multiplying. <br>
  \(4(x + 2b)(x &minus; a)\) <br>
  \(4(x^2 &minus; ax + 2bx &minus; 2ab)\) <br>
  \(4x^2 + 8bx &minus; 4ax &minus; 8ab&checkmark;\) </p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLE 3</strong></p>
<p>Find a strategy that fits and factor completely: \(40x^2y + 44xy &minus; 24y\).</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Is there a GCF? <br>
  \(40x^2y + 44xy &minus; 24y\) <br>
  Factor out the GCF, \(4y\). <br>
  \(4y(10x^2 + 11x &minus; 6)\) </p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Factor the trinomial with \(a \neq 1\) using the &ldquo;\(ac\)&rdquo; method or trial and error.<br>
  \(4y(5x &minus; 2)(2x + 3)\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Is the expression factored completely? <br>
  Yes. </p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  Check your answer by multiplying. <br>
  \(4y(5x &minus; 2)(2x + 3)\) <br>
  \(4y(10x^2 + 11x &minus; 6)\) <br>
  \(40x^2y + 44xy &minus; 24y&checkmark;\) </p>
