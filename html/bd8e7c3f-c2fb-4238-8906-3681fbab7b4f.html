<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students analyze worked examples of equations solved by completing the square. The work allows them
  to further develop their understanding of the method when used with rational numbers and to notice common errors.
  Identifying errors in worked examples is an opportunity to attend to precision and to analyze and critique the
  reasoning of others.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Display the four equations in the task statement for all to see:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> \(x^2+14x=-24\) </li>
  <li> \(x^2&minus;10x+16=0\) </li>
  <li> \(x^2+2.4x=-0.8\) </li>
  <li> \(x^2&minus;\frac{6}{5}x+\frac{1}{5}=0\) </li>
</ul>
<p>Arrange students in groups of three to four. Assign one equation (or more, depending on time constraints) for each
  group to solve by completing the square. Once group members agree on the solutions, ask them to look for errors in the
  worked solution for the same equation (as the one they solved).</p>

    <p>Give students additional time to make sure that everyone in their group can explain the errors they identified and proposed corrections. Invite groups to rehearse what they will say when they share with the whole class.

Make sure to vary who is selected to represent the work of the group so that students get accustomed to preparing each other to fill that role.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here are four equations followed by worked solutions of the equations. Each solution has at least one error.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Solve the equation \(x^2+14x=-24\). Then look at the following worked solution (with errors) and find and describe
    the error or errors in the worked solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rlr}x^{2}+14 x &amp; =-24 &amp; \text { Step 1 } \\ x^{2}+14 x+28 &amp; =4 &amp; \text { Step 2 } \\
  (x+7)^{2} &amp; =4 &amp; \text { Step 3 } \\ x + 7 &amp; =2 &amp; \text { Step 4 } \\ x+7 &amp; =-2 &amp; \text { Step

<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=-2\) and \(x=-12\)</p>
<p>Error: In Step 2, the number being added, 28, is not a perfect square. It should be 49.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Solve the equation \(x^2&minus;10x+16=0\). Then look at the following worked solution (with errors) and find and
    describe the error or errors in the worked solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rlr} x^{2}-10 x+16 &amp; =0 &amp; \text { Step 1 } \\ x^{2}-10 x+25 &amp; =9 &amp; \text { Step 2 }

<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=8\) and \(x=2\)</p>
<p>Errors: Step 4 should have 3 on the right side, not 9. Step 5 should have -3 on the right side, not -9.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Solve the equation \(x^2+2.4x=-0.8\). Then look at the following worked solution (with errors) and find and
    describe the error or errors in the worked solution.</li>

  \) </p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=-0.4\) and \(x=-2\)</p>
<p>Error: In Step 4, only the positive square root is written and the negative square root is neglected.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>Solve the equation \(x^2&minus;\frac{6}{5}x+\frac{1}{5}=0\). Then look at the following worked solution (with
    errors) and find and describe the error or errors in the worked solution.</li>
</ol>

  5}\\x=\frac65&amp;\text{&nbsp;and&nbsp;}x=0&amp;\text{Step 6}\end{array}\) </p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=1\) and \(x=\frac{1}{5}\)</p>
<p>Errors: For example:
  <br>
  In Step 2, different amounts are added to each side. On the left, \(\frac{4}{25}\) is added. On the right,
  \(\frac{9}{25}\) is added. Or: While \(\frac{9}{25}\) is added on the right side, \(\frac{1}{5}\) was only subtracted
  from the left side. Other explanations may also be accurate.
</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>To involve more students in the discussion, after each student presents, consider asking students to classify each
  error by type (not limited to one type per error) and explain their classification. Here are some examples of types of
  errors:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Careless errors&mdash;for example, writing the wrong number or symbol, repeating the same step twice, leaving out
    a negative sign, or not following directions. </li>
  <li> Computational errors&mdash;for example, adding or subtracting incorrectly or putting a decimal point in the wrong
    place. </li>
  <li> Gaps in understanding&mdash;for example, misunderstanding of the problem or the rules of algebra, applying an
    ineffective strategy, or choosing the wrong operation or step. </li>
  <li> Lack of precision or incomplete communication&mdash;for example, missing steps or explanations, incorrect
    notation, or forgetting labels or parentheses. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Spotting the Error When Solving Quadratics</h4>
<p>To find the error when solving quadratics, it is helpful to first solve the problem on your own.</p>
<p>Solve the quadratic equation by completing the square and finding its zeros. Identify the error in the worked
  solution below.</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{ll} x^{2}+10 x-34=0 &amp; \text { Step 1 } \\ x^{2}+10 x=34 &amp; \text { Step 2 } \\ x^{2}+10
  x+25=34-25 &amp; \text { Step 3 } \\ (x+5)^{2}=9 &amp; \text { Step 4 } \\ x+5=\pm \; 3 &amp; \text { Step 5 } \\
  x=-8, x=-2 &amp; \text { Step 6 } \end{array} \)</p>
<p>Now, find the error by working through the problem and comparing steps:</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{ll} x^{2}+10 x-34=0 &amp; \text { Step 1 } \\ x^{2}+10 x=34 &amp; \text { Step 2 } \\ x^{2}+10
  x+25=34+25 &amp; \text { Step 3 } \end{array} \)</p>
<p>In Step 3, 25 was added to the left side of the equation, but 25 was SUBTRACTED from the right side of the equation.
  Equations must remain balanced, and 25 should be added to each side of the equation.</p>
<h4>Try It: Spotting the Error When Solving Quadratics</h4>
<p>Examine the steps below and identify the error in solving the quadratic equation by completing the square:</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{lcc}x^2+8x+7=0&amp;\text{&nbsp;Step 1&nbsp;}&amp; \\ x^2+8x=-7&amp;\text{&nbsp;Step 2&nbsp;}&amp; \\
  x^2+8x+16=-7+16&amp;\text{&nbsp;Step 3&nbsp;}&amp; \\ (x+4)^2=9&amp;\text{&nbsp;Step 4&nbsp;}&amp; \\
  x+4=3&amp;\text{&nbsp;Step 5&nbsp;}&amp; \\ x=-1&amp;\text{&nbsp;Step 6&nbsp;}&amp;\end{array} \)</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to find the error when completing the square:</p>
<p>Work through the steps on your own and compare:</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{lc}x^2+8x+7=0&amp;\text{&nbsp;Step 1&nbsp;} \\ x^2+8x=-7&amp;\text{&nbsp;Step 2&nbsp;} \\
  x^2+8x+16=-7+16&amp;\text{&nbsp;Step 3&nbsp;} \\ (x+4)^2=9&amp;\text{&nbsp;Step 4&nbsp;} \\
  x+4=\pm3&amp;\text{&nbsp;Step 5&nbsp;} \\ x=-1,x=-7&amp;\text{&nbsp;Step 6&nbsp;}\end{array}\)</p>
<p>The error occurred in Step 5 when the plus-minus sign was not included after taking the square root of each side.
  This led to the second possible equation not being written.</p>
