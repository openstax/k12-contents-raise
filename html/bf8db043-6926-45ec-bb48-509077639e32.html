<p>A linear function of the bounce height would decrease by the same amount for each successive bounce. The
    differences in heights between successive bounces are not close to being the same, as shown in the table. They are
    decreasing with each bounce, so the function is not linear. </p>

<p>An exponential function of the bounce height would decrease by the same factor for each successive bounce. It looks
    like each successive bounce is about half as high as the previous bounce, making an exponential model appropriate.

<p> The difference in height after 6 bounces is 2.<br/>
      Using the equation: <br/>
      \(h=150 \cdot (0.50)^n\) and graphing \(h=150 \cdot (0.50)^6\). The graph shows the height to be 2.344 after 6 bounces \((n=6)\).
      <br/><br/>
      This is consistent with the reasoning :<br/>
      The height of the ball is decreasing by a factor of about \(\frac {1}{2}\) after each bounce. <br/>
      After the 4th bounce, the height difference is 9. It should decrease by \(\frac {1}{2}\) for each bounce after that.
      So, after 2 more bounces (the 6th bounce), it will decrease by a factor of about \(\frac {1}{4}\). The 6th bounce would be \(9 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \approx 2.25\). <br/>
      Rounding either 2.344 or 2.25 results in the answer 2.
