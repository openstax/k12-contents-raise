<p>In this lesson, you will learn to complete the square to solve non-monic quadratic equations, in which the squared term has a coefficient other than 1.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="ol-raise-noindent">
  <li> Complete the square for quadratic expressions of the form \(ax^2+bx+c\) when \(a\) is not 1 and explain the process. </li>
  <li> Solve quadratic equations in which the squared term coefficient is not 1 by completing the square. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
