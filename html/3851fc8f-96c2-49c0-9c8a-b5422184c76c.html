<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Explain the meaning of the intersection of the graphs of two functions in terms of the situations they represent. </li>
<li> Write an equation for the function given two points on a graph of an exponential function. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li> 5.13.1: Comparing Functions </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you looked closely at functions and explained the ways in which they were similar or distinct. </li>
</ul>
<li> 5.13.2: Creating Exponential Functions from Graphs&nbsp; </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you analyzed graphs of exponential functions to identify the initial value and the growth factor. You then created corresponding equations for the functions. </li>
</ul>
<li> 5.13.2: Self Check&nbsp; </li>
<li> 5.13.3: Comparing Exponential Functions </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you were presented with two graphs without numerical values assigned to any points on the graphs. Using the graphs, you compared their starting values and growth factors in the context of the situation. You also analyzed the point of intersection. </li>
</ul>
<li> 5.13.3: Self Check&nbsp; </li>
<li> 5.13.4: Interpreting Features of an Exponential Graph </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you used the graph of a given exponential function to determine possible values in the equation of the other exponential function. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
