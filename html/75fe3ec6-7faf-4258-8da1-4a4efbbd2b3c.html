<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
  <li>Given the graph of total distance walked as a function of time, was the person walking faster between 20 and 40 seconds or between 80 and 100 seconds?</li>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Between 80 and 100 seconds</p>

  <li>Was the person walking faster between 0 and 40 seconds or between 40 and 100 seconds, based on the given graph?</li>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Between 0 and 40 seconds</p>
</ol>
