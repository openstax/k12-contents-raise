<p>To help students&rsquo; understanding of key points from the lesson, discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> &ldquo;What is the difference between monomials, binomials, and trinomials?&rdquo; (Monomials have a single term, binomials have two terms, and trinomials have three terms.) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;How do you determine the degree of a polynomial?&rdquo; (The degree of a polynomial is the highest degree of all its terms.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;How do you add or subtract polynomials?&rdquo; (Polynomials are added or subtracted by combining like terms.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;How do you evaluate a polynomial function for a given value?&rdquo; (Substitute the given value into the function for the variable and simplify.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;How do you check a sum or difference when adding or subtracting polynomial functions?&rdquo; (Substitute a value for \(x\) into the individual polynomial functions. Add or subtract the results. The answer should be equal to the value you find when you substitute it into the sum or difference of the polynomial functions.) </li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
