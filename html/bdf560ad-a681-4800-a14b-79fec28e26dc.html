<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In this activity, students encounter a situation in which two constraints that can be expressed with inequalities are represented on two separate graphs, which makes it challenging to find pairs of values that meet both constraints simultaneously. This motivates a desire to represent both constraints on the same graph.</span><br></p>
<ul>
  <li>As students work, monitor for the different ways students try to find a pair of values that satisfies both inequalities. Some likely approaches:</li>
  <li>Substituting different values into the inequalities until they find a pair that makes both inequalities true.</li>
  <li>Visually estimating a point in the solution region of one graph that appears likely to be in the solution region of the other graph (for example, noticing that it is in the solution region of each inequality).</li>
  <li>Graphing both inequalities on the same coordinate plane (either by using technology or by copying the line in one graph onto the other graph) and finding a point in the region where they overlap.</li>
</ul>
<p>Identify students who use these or other approaches and ask them to share during class discussion.</p>
<h4>Launch&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Give students a moment to read the task statement and look at the two graphs. Ask students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;What are the two constraints in this situation?&rdquo; (A length constraint and a cost constraint)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Which graph represents which constraint? How do you know?&rdquo; (The first graph represents the length constraint. Possible explanations:<ul>
      <li>The graph intersects the vertical and horizontal axes at approximately 9.5, which means that if the quilter bought 0 yards of one color, he will need at least 9.5 yards of the other color.</li>
      <li>The length constraint says &ldquo;at least 9.5 yards,&rdquo; so the lengths must include values greater than 9.5, which is shown by the shaded region of the first graph.</li>
      <li>The second graph represents the cost constraint. If the quilter bought 0 yards of the light color, he could buy up to \(\frac{110}{13}\), or about 8.5, yards of the dark color fabric. This corresponds to the vertical intercept of the second graph.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>The cost constraint says &ldquo;up to $110,&rdquo; so the lengths must be below certain limits. The solution region of the second graph shows values below a boundary.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2 and provide access to graphing technology, in case it is requested.</p>
<p>Ask students to pause briefly after they have written both inequalities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verify that the inequalities students have written accurately represent the constraints before they proceed to the rest of the activity.</p>

<p><span>Student-Facing Statement</span><br></p>
<p>To make a quilt, a quilter is buying fabric in two colors, light and dark. He needs at least 9.5 yards of fabric in total.</p>
<p>The light color costs $9 a yard. The dark color costs $13 a yard. The quilter can spend up to $110 on fabric.</p>

<h4>Student Response</h4>
<p><span>Your answers may vary, but here are some sample responses to compare your answers.</span><br></p>
<ol>
  <li>\(x+y\geq9.5\) or equivalent</li>
  <li>\((5,5)\), \((7.5,3.5)\), and \((12,10)\)</li>
  <li>\(9x+13y\leq110\) or equivalent&nbsp;</li>
  <li>\((1,1)\), \((4,5)\), and \((10,1)\)</li>
  <li>2 yards of each color costs $44, which is less than $110, so it satisfies this constraint. However, this is only 4 yards altogether, which is not at least 9.5 yards.</li>
  <li>Sample responses: \((10,1)\), \((8,2)\), and \((6.5,3.5)\) (any point that is in the intersection of the two inequalities).</li>
  <li>For example: \((10,1)\) means 10 yards of light fabric and 1 yard of dark fabric. This is 11 yards of fabric altogether, which is more than 9.5. It costs $103 because \(9(10)+1(13)=103\). This is less than the $110 maximum.</li>
  <li><span>\(\left\{\begin{array}{l}9x+13y\leq110\\x+y\geq9.5\end{array}\right.\) or equivalent</span><br></li>
</ol>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p><span>Focus the discussion on the last two questions. Select previously identified students to share how they identified a pair of values that meets both constraints. Sequence their presentation in the order listed in the Activity Narrative, which is from less systematic to more systematic.</span><br></p>
<p>Select students who graphed both inequalities on the same plane to display their graphs for all to see.</p>
<p>If no students did this on their own, display the Desmos graph below as needed. Consider selecting first one inequality, then the other, and then both simultaneously. To show or hide an inequality, click the colored circle to the left of the equation desired.</p>
<div class="os-raise-ib-desmos-gc" data-schema-version="1.0"></div><br>
<p><span>(The Desmos graphs show both variables being restricted to positive values, but students are not expected to do this when graphing. Consider discussing with students why it makes sense in this situation to disregard negative values.)</span><br></p>
<p>Discuss the meaning of a pair of values that satisfies both inequalities. Emphasize that in this situation, it refers to the amount of fabric of each color that meets both the length and cost requirements.</p>
<p>Explain to students that the two inequalities representing the constraints in the same situation form a system of linear inequalities. In a system of linear equations, the solutions can be represented by one or more points where the graphs of the equations intersect. The solutions to a system of inequalities are all points in the region where the graphs of the two inequalities overlap because those points represent all pairs of values that make both inequalities true.</p>

<h4>Determine Whether an Ordered Pair Is a Solution of a System of Linear Inequalities</h4>
<p>The definition of a system of linear inequalities is very similar to the definition of a system of linear equations.<br></p>
<h5>System of Linear Inequalities<br></h5>
<p>Two or more linear inequalities grouped together form a system of linear inequalities.</p>
<p>A system of linear inequalities looks like a system of linear equations, but it has inequalities instead of equations. A system of two linear inequalities is shown here.</p>
<p>\(\left\{\begin{array}{l}x+4y\geq10\\3x-2y&lt;12\end{array}\right.\)</p>
<p>To solve a system of linear inequalities, we will find values of the variables that are solutions to both inequalities. We solve the system by using the graphs of each inequality and show the solution as a graph. We will find the region on the plane that contains all ordered pairs&nbsp;<span>\((x,y)\) that make both inequalities true.</span></p>
<h5>Solutions of A System of Linear Inequalities</h5>
<p>Solutions of a system of linear inequalities are the values of the variables that make all the inequalities true.</p>
<p>The solution of a system of linear inequalities is shown as a shaded region in the \((x, y)\) coordinate system that includes all the points whose ordered pairs make the inequalities true.<br></p>
<p>To determine if an ordered pair is a solution to a system of two inequalities, we substitute the values of the variables into each inequality. If the ordered pair makes both inequalities true, it is a solution to the system.<br></p>
<p><strong>Example</strong><br></p>
<p>Determine whether the ordered pair is a solution to this system:&nbsp;</p>
<p>\(\left\{\begin{array}{l}x+4y\geq10\\3x-2y&lt;12\end{array}\right.\)</p>
<p>A.) \((-2,4)\)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.) \((3,1)\)<br></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>A.) Is the ordered pair \((-2,4)\) a solution?</p>
<p><strong><img alt="We substitute x equal to negative 2 and y equal to 4 into both inequalities. First inequality is x plus 4 times y greater than or equal to 10. So negative 2 plus 4 open parentheses 4 close parenthesis is greater than or equal to 10 or not. 14 is greater than or equal to 10 is true. Second inequality, 3 times x minus 2 times y is less than 12. Three open parentheses negative 2 close parentheses minus two open parentheses 4 close parentheses is less than 12 or not. Negative 14 is less than 12 is true." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="91" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/6aa8c92882cff834137c795fbb93eb4163315bad" width="300"></strong><br></p>
<p><span>The ordered pair \((-2,4)\) made both inequalities true. Therefore \((-2,4)\) is a solution to this system.</span></p>
<p><span>B.) Is the ordered pair \((3,1)\) a solution?</span></p>
<p><strong><img alt="We substitute x equal to three and y equal to one into both inequalities. First inequality is x plus four times y greater than or equal to ten. So three plus four open parentheses one close parenthesis is greater than or equal to ten or not. Seven greater than or equal to ten is false. Second inequality, three times x minus two times y is less than twelve. Three open parentheses three close parentheses minus two open parentheses one close parentheses is less than twelve or not. Seven less than 12 holds true." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="93" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/bb4c583f5689a1a325dd64a1c97f16b9d5bcd9e7" width="300"></strong><br></p>
<p><span>The ordered pair \((3,1)\) made one inequality true, but it makes the other one false. Therefore \((3,1)\) is not a solution to this system.</span></p>
<h4>Try It: Determine Whether an Ordered Pair Is a Solution of a System of Linear Inequalities</h4>
<p>Determine whether the ordered pair is a solution to the system:&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>\(\left\{\begin{array}{l}y&gt;4x-2\\4x-y&lt;20\end{array}\right.\)</p>
