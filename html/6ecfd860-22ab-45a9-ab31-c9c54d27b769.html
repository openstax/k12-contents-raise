<p dir="ltr">In grade 8, students informally constructed scatter plots and lines of fit and noticed linear patterns. In this unit, students build on this previous knowledge by assessing how well a linear model matches the data using residuals as well as the correlation coefficient for best-fit lines (found using technology).</p><p dir="ltr">The unit begins with bivariate numerical data, which are visualized using scatter plots and lines of best fit. Students use technology to compute the lines of best fit and observe how well the linear models match the data. Residuals and correlation coefficients are used to quantify the goodness of fit for linear models.</p><p dir="ltr">The unit closes with an exploration of the difference between correlation and causal relationships, as well as an opportunity to apply this learning to areas of interest, like anthropology and sports.</p><p><br></p>
