<p>The goal of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is to provide a research-based framework to &ldquo;improve and optimize teaching and learning for all people.&rdquo; (CAST)</p>
<p>UDL is based on three core guidelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Engagement, </li>
  <li> Representation, and </li>
  <li> Action &amp; Expression. </li>
</ul>
<!-- Accordion Item #1-->
<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> Engagement</button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>Students&rsquo; attitudes, interests, and values help determine how they are most engaged and motivated to learn. Supports that align with this principle offer the following instructional strategies that provide students with multiple means of engagement:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Help provide access by leveraging curiosity and students&rsquo; existing interests </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li> Leverage choice around perceived challenges and encourage and support opportunities for peer collaboration </li>
      <li> Provide structures that help students maintain sustained effort and persistence during a task and offer tools and strategies designed to help students self-motivate and become more independent </li>
    </ul>

<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> Representation</button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>Teachers can reduce barriers and leverage students&rsquo; strengths by inviting students to engage with the same content differently. Supports that align with this principle offer instructional strategies that provide students with multiple means of representation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Offer alternatives for the ways information is presented or displayed </li>
      <li> Help develop students&rsquo; understanding and use of mathematical language and symbols </li>
      <li> Illustrate connections between and across mathematical representations using color and annotations </li>
      <li> Identify opportunities to activate or supply background knowledge </li>
      <li> Describe organizational methods and approaches designed to help students internalize learning </li>
    </ul>

  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> Action and Expression</button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>Students can share their understanding and reasoning about mathematical ideas throughout the curriculum. Supports that align with this principle offer instructional strategies that provide students with multiple means of action and expression:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Encourage flexibility and choice with the ways students demonstrate their understanding </li>
      <li> List sentence frames that support discourse or accompany writing prompts </li>
      <li> Indicate appropriate tools, templates, and assistive technologies </li>
      <li> Support the development of organizational problem-solving skills </li>
      <li> Provide checklists that enable students to monitor their progress </li>
    </ul>

<h4>Differentiation of Learning</h4>
<p>Once you implement the UDL guidelines in your classroom, you&rsquo;ll find many opportunities to differentiate learning for each student. Differentiation is when you adjust the approach or method of learning to fully support learners of all ability levels, strengths, and weaknesses.</p>
<p>In the classroom, differentiating instruction may look like a teacher presenting the same material to all students differently, or it may require delivering lessons with varying difficulty levels based on student&rsquo;s readiness. Differentiation gives students opportunities to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in different ways. Remember that differentiation does not replace a student&rsquo;s Individualized Education Program (IEP) or &ldquo;504 Plan.&rdquo;</p><br>
<p>Teachers can differentiate content, process, or product according to a student's readiness, interests, and learning styles; all from within a classroom environment designed to maximize individual growth.</p>

    <p>The climate and feel of the classroom set the stage for building an atmosphere where students can thrive with differentiated instruction.</p>
    <p>Differentiating the learning environment in a math classroom may look like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Providing culturally relevant learning materials for a diverse classroom </li>
      <li> Setting up spaces where students can work independently and in small groups </li>
      <li> Expanding the learning space to include outdoors, library, computer labs, or personal spaces where students feel the most comfortable </li>
      <li> Creating a culture of continual assessment where informal and formative assessments are just classroom norms </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> Content</button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>The content is the desired standards and outcomes that are expected based on the student's academic level, adjusted to best suit the student&rsquo;s current knowledge and skills. </p>
    <p>Differentiating content in a math classroom may look like this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Pretesting students to determine who may not need direct instruction or who may have gaps in foundational prerequisite knowledge and skills </li>
      <li> Reviewing IEPs to determine what content may not be appropriate based on Admission, Review, and Dismissal (ARD) committee decisions </li>
      <li> Adjusting the reading levels of content materials </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The learning process is how a student makes sense of the content and internalizes the new information and skills.</p>
    <p>Differentiating the learning process in a math classroom may look like this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Providing graphic organizers, maps, diagrams, and charts to help organize information </li>
      <li> Setting up mini-lessons to help students target skill development for gaps in learning </li>
      <li> Implement manipulatives into the lesson to help make abstract content more concrete </li>
      <li> Allowing varying amounts of time to complete assignments to help a struggling learner </li>
      <li> Encouraging advanced learners to go more in-depth to a topic </li>
    </ul>

<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> Learning Profile</button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>Students have learning profiles and preferences for how they access new information and demonstrate new knowledge and skills.</p>
    <p>Differentiate based on learning profiles, which may look like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Providing video and auditory support for content </li>
      <li> Offering choices and flexibility in how students document knowledge gains </li>
      <li> Creating student contracts which gives flexibility in the product medium </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Differentiating based on learning profiles can help build efficiency in the learning process.</p>

  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>Engaging students by identifying their interest levels can increase motivation and personalization of learning.</p>
    <p>Differentiating based on student&rsquo;s interest may look like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Implementing interest inventories to help students connect mathematics to future career choices </li>
      <li> Offering authentic projects where students can choose from multiple approaches to demonstrate the same TEKS </li>
      <li> Asking multiple students who demonstrate the real-world application of math for the same instructional sequence </li>

<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> Readiness</button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>All students are ready to learn new content in the instructional sequence at different times. They may lack the prerequisite knowledge, skills, or abilities to progress further. Additionally, in the case of your &ldquo;gifted and talented&rdquo; students, they could be ready before much of the class.</p>
    <p>Differentiating based on readiness may look like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Breaking into mini-groups to focus on skill gaps or extending the learning </li>
      <li> Scaffolding learning activities by assigning tasks based on student characteristics </li>
      <li> Providing instructional supports to help with memory of factors, formulas, or important mathematical terminolog </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Differentiating based on learning profiles can help build growth in the learning process.</p>

<h4>Building a Library of Resources</h4>
<p>Throughout the OpenStax Algebra 1 curriculum, you&rsquo;ll be introduced to sample strategies based on UDL and differentiated learning to support your students with disabilities. An infinite number of teaching and learning combinations could be implemented for each lesson and activity. Our goal is for you to become familiar with different strategies matched to different types of learners, so that you can pack them into your own &ldquo;library of resources.&rdquo; Then, as you plan for a lesson, you can select a combination of the strategies, tools, and learning products to scaffold all students to demonstrate their growth in learning Algebra I.</p>
