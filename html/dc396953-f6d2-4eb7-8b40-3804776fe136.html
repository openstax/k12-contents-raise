<ul>
  <li><span lang="EN">Describe the
      strength of a relationship between two variables.</span></li>
  <li><span lang="EN">Use
      technology to find the correlation coefficient and explain what the value tells
      me about a linear model in everyday language.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN">Here are the <b>activities</b> that helped you reach those goals:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li><span lang="EN">3.5.1: Using Bivariate Data in Context</span>
    <ul>
      <li><span lang="EN">In this activity, you matched bivariate data with its context. You thought about whether there would be a strong correlation or not as well as whether the relationship was a positive or negative correlation. </span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span lang="EN">3.5.2: Finding and Using Correlation Coefficient to Interpret the Strength of Linear Relationships</span>
    <ul>
      <li><span lang="EN">In this activity, you used technology to find a correlation coefficient given data and used it to interpret the strength of the linear relationship in context. In addition, you interpreted the coefficients of the equation of the line of best fit and used the equation to make predictions.</span></li>

  <li><span lang="EN">3.5.3: Using Correlation Coefficient to Describe Relationships between Two Variables</span>
    <ul>
      <li><span lang="EN">In this activity, you used the correlation coefficient to describe the relationship between two variables. You examined a pair of variables and a correlation coefficient to describe the relationship between the variables as strong or weak and as positive or negative.</span></li>
