<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Create quadratic functions and graphs that represent a situation. </li>
<li> Relate the vertex of a graph and the zeros of a function to a situation. </li>
<li> Know that the domain of a function can depend on the situation it represents. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li> 7.6.1: Using Linear Functions to Describe Constant Speed </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you considered what happens if an object is launched up in the air unaffected by gravity. It reinforced your knowledge that an object that travels at a constant speed can be described with a linear function. </li>
</ul>
<li> 7.6.2: The Force of Gravity Change in Quadratic Functions </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you learned a model that accounts for the fact that an object that is launched straight up at a constant speed does not keep going at the same rate when the influence of gravity is taken into account. The big lesson was that adding a quadratic term to a linear function has an effect of &ldquo;bending&rdquo; the graph, as the output values are no longer changing at a constant rate. </li>
<li> 7.6.2: Self Check </li>
<li> 7.6.2: Additional Resources </li>
</ul>
<li> 7.6.3: Using Quadratic Functions to Describe Height </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you explored another model of a projectile motion. You graphed and interpreted a quadratic function in context and began considering a reasonable domain for the function. </li>
<li> 7.6.3: Self Check </li>
<li> 7.6.3: Additional Resources </li>
</ul>
<li> 7.6.4: Interpreting Graphs of Quadratic Functions </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you examined a quadratic function and its graph and identified what each term of the equation meant in the context of the situation graphed. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice:</strong></p>

<li> 7.6.5: Practice </li>
