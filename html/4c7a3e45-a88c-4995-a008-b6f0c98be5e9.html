<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain when a relationship between two quantities is a function. </li>
<li>Identify independent and dependent variables in a function, and use words and graphs to represent the function. </li>
<li>Explain what descriptions and graphs of functions tell us about situations. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals: </p>
<ul>
<li>4.1.1: Contrasting Two Relationships by Reasoning </li>
<ul>
<li>In this activity, you looked at which relationships represent a function and learned which quantities are functions of the other. </li>
</ul>
<li>4.1.2: Reasoning Graphically About the Relationship between the Two Quantities </li>
<ul>
<li>In this activity, you sketched graphs about a dog&rsquo;s movement as distance was a function of time. </li>
</ul>
<li>4.1.2: Self Check </li>
<li>4.1.3: Examining Relations and Functions </li>
<ul>
<li>In this activity, you determined if relations are functions by looking at the given inputs and outputs. </li>
</ul>
<li>4.1.3: Self Check </li>
<li>4.1.4: Describing Functional Relationships </li>
<ul>
<li>In this activity, you identified the independent and dependent variables in functional relationships. You also determined which variable was a function of the other to make statements about the relationship. </li>
</ul>
<li>4.1.4: Self Check </li>
<li>4.1.5: Modeling Relationships between Two Variables </li>
<ul>
<li>In this activity, you summarized everything you have learned in this lesson by identifying independent and dependent variables of a situation, determining which variable is a function of the other, and sketching a graph of the situation. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>

<li>4.1.6: Practice</li>
