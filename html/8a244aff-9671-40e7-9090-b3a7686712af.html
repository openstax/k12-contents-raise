<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students focus on producing and interpreting a graph representing a quantity that decays exponentially. They can then use the graph to make some estimates about the context, which is about algae control. After students create their graph, use the activity synthesis to encourage students to interpret the meaning of input values that are not whole numbers.</p>
<p>Note that the axes on the given graph aren&rsquo;t scaled. Students will need to make sure that the vertical intercept can be plotted and that it is not too close to 0. If students do the work to decide how to scale the axes, they are creating a coherent representation of the relationship.</p>
<p>Making graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically.</p>
<h4> Launch</h4>
<p>To introduce the context and keep students thinking about exponential growth and decay, consider presenting a riddle:</p>
<p>A certain area of the pond is covered in algae. Each day, the algae-covered area doubles. If it takes 24 days for the algae to completely cover the pond, how many days did it take to cover half of the pond? Given the word &ldquo;half,&rdquo; students may be inclined to immediately say that it takes 12 days. But if they ponder the situation a bit, they should recognize that it takes 23 days to cover half the pond because it only takes one more day&mdash;or one more doubling&mdash;to cover the whole pond.</p>
<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>
<div>
<p>Activate or supply background knowledge. Provide students with access to a blank table of values. Invite students to complete the table for when \(t\) is 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then discuss how to use this information to choose an appropriate scale for the axes.</p>
</div>
<br>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>To control an algae bloom in a lake, scientists introduce some treatment products.</p>
<p>Once the treatment begins, the area covered by algae in square yards, \(A\), is given by the equation \(A=240 \cdot (\frac{1}{3})^t\). Time, \(t\), is measured in weeks.</p>

<ol>
<li> In the equation, what does 240 tell us about the algae? <br><br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> The algae initially covers 240 square yards.
    </li><br>
<li> What does the \(\frac13\) tell us? <br><br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> Every week, the area covered is \(\frac13\) of the area covered the previous week.

<li> Approximately, how many square yards will the algae cover after 2.5 weeks? Explain your reasoning. 
    <br>
<br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> Sample response: The algae will cover fewer than 27 square yards and more than 9 square yards because the area covered by the algae is decreasing. A number between 15 and 20 would be a good guess.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Student-Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>The scientists estimate that to keep the algae bloom from spreading after the treatment concludes, they will need to get the area covered under one square foot. How many weeks should they run the treatment to achieve this?<br><br>
<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>7 weeks. There are 9 square feet in every square yard, so 1 square foot is \(\frac19\) square yard (or about 0.111 square yard). At 7 weeks is the first time the area covered by algae is less than \(\frac19\) because \(240 \cdot (\frac{1}{3})^6 \approx 0.329\), and \(240 \cdot (\frac{1}{3})^7 \approx 0.110\).
</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may find it challenging to choose a scale for the axes in a way that helps them plot the points and see a pattern. If they are still struggling to choose a scale for the axes after a few minutes, ask students to think about the greatest and least vertical coordinates they need to show on the graph and what the height of each rectangle on the grid should be to show these values. In addition, if they get stuck plotting points, suggest that they first make a table of values.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Once students have created reasonable graphs, focus the discussion on the non-integer values of \(t\). Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;What does a \(t\) value of 2.5 mean?&rdquo; (A \(t\) value of 2.5 means 2.5 weeks, or a little more than 17 days after treatment begins.) </li>
<li>&ldquo;How did you estimate the area covered by algae after a certain non-whole number of weeks?&rdquo; (We can use the graph to estimate the area of algae, which is between the area in week 2 and that in week 3, though not too much precision can be given. It is definitely less than 27 square yards and more than 9 square yards. Following the general trend of the points decreasing less and less rapidly as time goes on, an estimate of 15 is reasonable.) </li>
</ul>
<p>Time permitting, consider discussing the following question:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Someone says that after seven weeks, the algae will disappear. Do you agree?&rdquo; (Sample responses: No, if we keep multiplying by \(\frac13\), the area will keep getting smaller, but it will never reach 0. No, after seven weeks there would be about \(\frac19\) of a square yard or 1 square foot covered by algae. Yes, rounded to the nearest square yard, there are 0 square yards covered by the algae after seven weeks.) </li>

<p>That&rsquo;s correct! Check yourself: Exponential functions have the form \(y=ab^x\), where \(a\) is the initial value or \(y\)-intercept. Since 12 is the \(a\)-value, the graph crosses the \(y\)-axis at \((0,12)\).</p>
