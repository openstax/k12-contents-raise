<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students focus on producing and interpreting a graph representing a quantity that decays
  exponentially. They can then use the graph to make some estimates about the context, which is about algae control.
  After students create their graph, use the activity synthesis to encourage students to interpret the meaning of input
  values that are not whole numbers.</p>
<p>Note that the axes on the given graph aren&rsquo;t scaled. Students will need to make sure that the vertical
  intercept can be plotted and that it is not too close to 0. If students do the work to decide how to scale the axes,
  they are creating a coherent representation of the relationship.</p>
<p>Making graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically.</p>
<h4> Launch</h4>
<p>To introduce the context and keep students thinking about exponential growth and decay, consider presenting a riddle:
</p>
<p>A certain area of the pond is covered in algae. Each day, the algae-covered area doubles. If it takes 24 days for the
  algae to completely cover the pond, how many days did it take to cover half of the pond? Given the word
  &ldquo;half,&rdquo; students may be inclined to immediately say that it takes 12 days. But if they ponder the
  situation a bit, they should recognize that it takes 23 days to cover half the pond because it only takes one more
  day&mdash;or one more doubling&mdash;to cover the whole pond.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>To control an algae bloom in a lake, scientists introduce some treatment products.</p>
<p>Once the treatment begins, the area covered by algae in square yards, \(A\), is given by the equation \(A=240 \cdot
  (\frac{1}{3})^t\). Time, \(t\), is measured in weeks.</p>

  <li> Approximately, how many square yards will the algae cover after 2.5 weeks? Be prepared to show your reasoning.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> For example: The algae will cover fewer than 27 square yards and more than 9 square yards
    because the area covered by the algae is decreasing. A number between 15 and 20 would be a good guess.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>The scientists estimate that to keep the algae bloom from spreading after the treatment concludes, they will need to
  get the area covered under one square foot. How many weeks should they run the treatment to achieve this?<br><br>
  <strong>Answer: </strong>7 weeks. There are 9 square feet in every square yard, so 1 square foot is \(\frac19\) square
  yard (or about 0.111 square yard). At 7 weeks is the first time the area covered by algae is less than \(\frac19\)
  because \(240 \cdot (\frac{1}{3})^6 \approx 0.329\), and \(240 \cdot (\frac{1}{3})^7 \approx 0.110\).
</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may find it challenging to choose a scale for the axes in a way that helps them plot the points and see a
  pattern. If they are still struggling to choose a scale for the axes after a few minutes, ask students to think about
  the greatest and least vertical coordinates they need to show on the graph and what the height of each rectangle on
  the grid should be to show these values. In addition, if they get stuck plotting points, suggest that they first make
  a table of values.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Once students have created reasonable graphs, focus the discussion on the non-integer values of \(t\). Discuss
  questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;What does a \(t\) value of 2.5 mean?&rdquo; (A \(t\) value of 2.5 means 2.5 weeks, or a little more than 17
    days after treatment begins.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;How did you estimate the area covered by algae after a certain non-whole number of weeks?&rdquo; (We can
    use the graph to estimate the area of algae, which is between the area in week 2 and that in week 3, though not too
    much precision can be given. It is definitely less than 27 square yards and more than 9 square yards. Following the
    general trend of the points decreasing less and less rapidly as time goes on, an estimate of 15 is reasonable.)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Time permitting, consider discussing the following question:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Someone says that after seven weeks, the algae will disappear. Do you agree?&rdquo; (Compare your answer:
    No, if we keep multiplying by \(\frac13\), the area will keep getting smaller, but it will never reach 0. No, after
    seven weeks there would be about \(\frac19\) of a square yard or 1 square foot covered by algae. Yes, rounded to the
    nearest square yard, there are 0 square yards covered by the algae after seven weeks.) </li>

 That&rsquo;s correct! Check yourself: Exponential functions have the form \(y=ab^x\), where \(a\) is the initial
    value or \(y\)-intercept. Since 12 is the \(a\)-value, the graph crosses the \(y\)-axis at \((0,12)\).

  <li> Part 5 asks about the vertical intercept and what it means. The vertical intercept is 100,000, which is the
    initial amount of the butterfly population. This means that when the butterflies start their migration (at 
    \(w=0\) weeks), the population is initially 100,000.<br><br>
    The \(y\)-intercept is the value of \(p\) when 
\(w=0\), which corresponds to the initial condition or starting point of the migration. Substituting \(w=0\)  into the equation, we have \(p=100000 \cdot (45)^0=100000 \cdot 1=100000\).

      <li>For part 7, an asymptote is a line or curve that a function approaches but does not intersect or touch. In other words, as the input values of a function approach a certain value or tend towards infinity or negative infinity, the function values get arbitrarily close to the asymptote without actually crossing it. Asymptotes can provide valuable information about the behavior of a function and can help in understanding its limits and range.
        <br><br>To determine the asymptote, we examine the behavior of the function as \(w\) approaches infinity. In this case, as \(w\) becomes larger and larger, the term 
        \((45)^w\) will grow exponentially. Consequently, the population \(p\) will also grow infinitely. There is no horizontal asymptote in this equation. The graph of the function will continue to increase indefinitely as \(w\) increases, without approaching a specific horizontal line. The butterfly population will increase over time.

  <li> Use your equation or graph to find \(c\) when \(y=6\). What does this mean in terms of the book sales?<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    If you use the equation you would substitute 6 in for \(y\), or \(c=600,000(\frac{1}{2})^6\), and evaluate to find the solution.

    The answer 9,375 means that six years after the book was published, 9,375 copies of the book were sold.

  <li>What is the vertical intercept of the graph? What does it tell you about the number of copies sold?<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    <ul  class="os-raise-noindent">
      <li>The \(y\)-intercept represents the value of the function when 
        \(t=0\), which corresponds to the year the book was released. Substituting \(t=0\) into the function, we have <br>\(f(0)=600,000 \cdot ( 21​ )^ 0 =600,000 \cdot 1=600,000\).</li>
        <li>The \(y\)-intercept is 600,000. This means that, in the year the book was released (at 
          \(t=0\)), 600,000 copies were sold.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>What is the asymptote of the graph? What does it tell you about the number of copies sold over time?<br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
    <ul  class="os-raise-noindent">
      <li>To determine the asymptote, we need to consider the behavior of the function as \(t\) approaches infinity. As \(t\) increases, the exponent 
        \((\frac {1}{2})t\) becomes smaller and smaller. Eventually, as \(t\) approaches infinity, the exponent approaches 0.
        </li>
        <li>The function 
          \(f(t)\) approaches the value 0 as \(t\) tends towards infinity. In other words, the horizontal asymptote of the function is \(y=0\).</li>
          <li>The asymptote is 
            \(y=0\), indicating that as the number of years increases indefinitely, the number of copies sold approaches zero.</li>
    </ul>
