<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Ask each group to come up with a new geometric sequence and be prepared to explain why it is a geometric sequence. After a brief work time, select 3 &ndash; 4 groups to share their sequence and why it is a geometric sequence. Encourage students to use precise language as they share with the class, such as &ldquo;term,&rdquo; &ldquo;multiplier,&rdquo; and &ldquo;common ratio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If time allows, ask students if they think the sequence 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 is a geometric sequence. (Yes, it has a common ratio of 1.)</p>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
