<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Ask each group to come up with a new geometric sequence and be prepared to explain why it is a geometric sequence. After a brief work time, select 3&ndash;4 groups to share their sequence and why it is a geometric sequence. Encourage students to use precise language as they share with the class, such as &ldquo;term,&rdquo; &ldquo;multiplier,&rdquo; and &ldquo;common ratio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If time allows, ask students if they think the sequence 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 is a geometric sequence. (Yes, it has a common ratio of 1.)</p>
