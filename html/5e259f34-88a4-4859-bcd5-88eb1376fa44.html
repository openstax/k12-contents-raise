<h4>Cool Down Activity</h4>
<p>At the end of the school year, all students in the ninth grade are invited to an ice cream party. Use the skills you learned from planning a pizza party to answer the following:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Write an expression that could represent an estimated cost for the party. Use at least one letter. State what each part of the expression represents.<br><br></li>
  <li>Choose a letter in your expression. Describe the values that would be reasonable for the quantity that the letter represents.</li>
</ol>

    <p><span>Compare your answer:</span></p>
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
      <li>Compare your answer:<ul>
          <li><span>\( 1.50n + 0.08(1.50n) \)</span>. There are&nbsp;<span>\( n \)</span>&nbsp;students in the ninth grade. A packaged ice cream cone is about&nbsp;<span>$</span>1.50, and tax is about 8%.</li>
          <li><span>\( \frac {125}{6} \cdot 5 + 6(3) + p \)</span>. There are 125 students in the ninth grade. Suppose a tub of ice cream costs&nbsp;<span>$</span>5 and is enough for 6 students. A pack of 24 cones costs about&nbsp;<span>$</span>3, and 6 packs are needed. A pack of 150 paper napkins costs&nbsp;<span>\( p \)</span>&nbsp;dollars.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Compare your answer:<ul>
          <li>A whole number between 90 and 100 is a reasonable value for the number of students in ninth grade, or&nbsp;\( 90 \leq n \geq 100 \)</li>
          <li>A number less than $4 but more than $1 is reasonable for the cost of a pack of paper napkins, or&nbsp;\( 1 &lt; n &lt; 4 \).</li>
