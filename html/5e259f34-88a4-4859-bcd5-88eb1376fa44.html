    <p>Your answer may vary, but here are some samples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each scoop of ice cream costs $0.75 and the cost of each topping is $1.50 which sum to the cost of one bowl of ice cream. Now we multiply the cost of one bowl of ice cream by the number of students in the class. </li>
      <li>A flat cost of $4 per bowl of ice cream for each student plus a charge of $15 for the bowls, spoons, and napkins.</li>
      <li>There are \(n\) students in the ninth grade. A packaged ice cream cone is about $1.50, and tax is about 8%.</li>
      <li>There are 125 students in the ninth grade. Suppose a tub of ice cream costs $5 and is enough for 6 students. A pack of 24 cones costs about $3, and 6 packs are needed. A pack of 150 paper napkins costs \(p\) dollars.</li>

    <p>Your answer may vary, but here are some samples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You may choose to limit each student to selecting at most five toppings, \(t\), per bowl of ice cream. Or, \(t \leq 5\).</li>
      <li>The number of scoops of ice cream, \(s\), provided to each student should not exceed three. Or, \(s \leq 3\)</li>
      <li>The number of students, \(n\), at the ninth grade party will probably be less than 730. Or,\( n \lt 730\). </li>
      <li>A whole number between 90 and 100 is a reasonable value for the number of students in ninth grade, or 90 \(\leq n \geq 100\).</li>
      <li>A number less than $4 but more than $1 is reasonable for the cost of a pack of paper napkins, or \(1 \lt n \lt\) 4.</li>
