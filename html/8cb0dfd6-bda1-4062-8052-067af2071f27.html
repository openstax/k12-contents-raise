<p>The expressions \(p(200 &minus; 5p)\) and \(-5p^2 + 200p\) define the same function. The function models the revenue a school would earn from selling raffle tickets at \(p\) dollars each.</p>

    <p>We could write \(p(200 &minus; 5p) = 500\) and \(-5p^2 + 200p = 500\). Approximate solutions can be found using trial and error or graphing. However, we don&rsquo;t yet know an exact way to solve either equation.</p>
