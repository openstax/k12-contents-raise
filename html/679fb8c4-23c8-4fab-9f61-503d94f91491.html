<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this warm up, students reason about equations with quadratic expressions on both sides of the equal sign. They look for and use structure to solve the equations. Though each equation appears to be more complicated or to have more pieces than the preceding one, the underlying structure of all the equations is unchanged: \((something)^2=a^2\). The last equation is written in factored form, but because the factors are identical, students can see that it can also be written as \((something)^2=a^2\). Viewing a complicated expression as a perfect square prepares students to consider completing the square later.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Give students a moment to observe the list of equations and ask them what they notice and wonder about the equations. Solicit a few observations and questions. Tell students that their job is to think about what \(a\) should be so that each equation is always true, regardless of what \(x\) is.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>In each equation, what expression could be substituted for \(a\) so the equation is true for all values of \(x\)?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The correct answer is \(a=2x-9\).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their responses and how they viewed the equations. If not mentioned by students, point out that the question can be thought of as: "When \(a\) is squared, it is equal to something squared," so \(a\) must be equal to that something.</p>
<p>Explain to students that expressions that represent something squared are known as perfect squares. This term is related to what students learned in earlier grades about the area of a square. Multiplying the side length of a square by itself gives the area of the square, so we can say, for instance, that 25 is a perfect square because it is the area (in square units) of a square whose side length is 5 units. \((2x&minus;9)(2x&minus;9)\) can be thought of as the area of a square with side length \(2x&minus;9\). To help students visualize, draw squares and label the side lengths to discuss the area of the square.</p>
