<p>Nafy&rsquo;s company makes nutritious snacks. She can represent constraints using systems of inequalities to find combinations of ingredients that meet nutritional goals and make the company money.</p><p>In this section, you will build on your understanding of solving linear systems of equations in two variables and finding solutions to linear inequalities in two variables to find the solutions to systems of linear inequalities in two variables. You will learn that two linear inequalities that represent the constraints in the same situation form a system of inequalities and that the solutions to the system include all numbers that satisfy both constraints simultaneously. Graphically, the solution set of the system is represented by the region where the graphs of the individual inequalities overlap. You will decide whether the solution set of any specific system of inequalities includes the boundary lines.&nbsp;</p><p>This section includes 2 lessons:</p>
