<p dir="ltr">Solicit from students any advantages and disadvantages for representing constraints as inequalities. Some advantages students might bring up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compared to written words, inequalities are a simpler and quicker way to describe what is happening in a situation.</li>
<li>It is easier to see what values a certain quantity could or could not take when the constraint is written with symbols and numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Possible disadvantages:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Unless we know what the variables stand for, we can&rsquo;t be sure about the meaning of an inequality.</li>
<li>If we don&rsquo;t recall what the symbols mean or how to read them, we can&rsquo;t access the information.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Next, invite students to share some advice for students who might just be learning to write inequalities to represent constraints. What should they pay attention to? What are some potential sources of confusion or error they should look out for? Students might mention that the following are important things to attend to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Specifying the meaning of each variable</span></li>
<li>Not using the same variable to represent different quantities</li>
<li>Making sure that the correct symbols are used to represent relationships</li>
<li>Using words to read each inequality to make sure that it fully represents a constraint</li>
</ul>
