<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the slope and vertical intercept of a line with equation \( ax+by=c \).</li>
<li>Take an equation of the form&nbsp;\( ax+by=c \) and rearrange it into the equivalent form \( y=mx+b \).</li>
<li>Use a variety of strategies to find the slope and vertical intercept of the graph of a linear equation given in different forms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.11.1: Applying the Distributive Property to Rewrite Expressions<ul>
<li>In this activity, you rewrote expressions and discussed your strategies, including the distributive property.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1.11.2: Relating Two-Variable Equations, Their Graphs, and Situations<ul>
<li>In this activity, you looked at two graphs from previous lessons and which numbers were slopes and intercepts. You also interpreted the meaning of those numbers in the situations graphed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1.11.2: Self Check</li>
<li>1.11.3: Reasoning Symbolically and Abstractly about Linear Equations<ul>
<li>In this activity, you matched equations in standard form to their slopes and y-intercepts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1.11.3: Self Check</li>
<li>1.11.4: Identifying the Features of a Graph<ul>
<li>In this activity, you used an equation to identify features of the graph of the equation including the slope and where the line would cross the x-axis and y-axis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
