<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity reinforces the understandings that students began to develop in an earlier lesson about the
  connections between the structure of two-variable linear equations, their graphs, and the situations they represent. </p>
<p>Students first practice relating the parameters of an equation in slope-intercept form to the features of the graph
  and interpreting them in terms of the situation (MP2). Next, they practice making a case for how they know that a
  graph represents an equation given in standard form.</p>
<p>Some students may argue that substituting the \( (x,y) \) pair of any point
  on the line gives a true statement, suggesting that the graph does match the equation. Or they may reason about the
  points on the graph in terms of almonds and figs and come to the same conclusion. For example, \( (8,3) \) and \(
  (11,1) \) are points
  on the line. If Clare buys 8 pounds of almonds and 3 pounds of figs, or 11 pounds of almonds and 1 pound of figs,
  the price is $75.</p>
<p>Ask these students how they would check whether the points with fractional \( x\) - and \( y\) -values (which are
  harder to identify precisely from
  the graph) would also produce true statements when those values are substituted. Use this difficulty to motivate
  rearranging the equation into slope-intercept form.</p>
<p>The work in this activity requires students to reason quantitatively and abstractly about the equation and the
  graph and to construct a logical argument.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Display the two graphs in the task statement for all to see. Tell students the graphs represent two situations they
  have seen in earlier activities.</p>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Give students a minute of quiet time to think individually and ask them to be
  prepared to share at least one thing they notice and one thing they wonder about the graphs. Give them another
  minute to discuss their observations and questions with their partner before moving on to the task.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>For this activity, you will use two graphs that represent situations you saw in other activities. </p>
<p>For questions 1–3, use the graph below:<br>
  The graph represents \(a = 450 − 20t\), which describes the relationship between gallons of water in a tank and time
  in minutes.</p>

<br>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" >
  <li>Where on the graph can we see the 450?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
  450 is where the graph intersects the
  vertical axis.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent"  start="2">
  <li>Where can we see the -20? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
  −20 is the slope.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent"  start="3">
  <li>What do the numbers 450 and -20 mean in the situation that is graphed?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
  Your answer
  may vary, but here is a sample. <br>
  450 is the gallons of water in the tank at 0 minutes, before the tank starts to be drained. −20
  means the gallons of water (vertical value) drops by 20 for every 1 minute increase in time (horizontal value).
  is the slope. </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent"  start="4">
  <li> The graph represents \(6x +9y = 75\). It describes the relationship between pounds of almonds and figs and the
    dollar amount Clare spent on them. Suppose a classmate says, “I am not sure the graph represents \(6x +9y = 75\)
    because I don’t see the 6, 9, or 75 on the graph.” How would you show your classmate that the graph indeed
    represents
    this equation? <br>
    <br>
    <img alt="Graph of a line. Vertical axis, dried figs, pounds. Horizontal axis, Almonds, pounds." height="196"
      src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/e183cfb486b4c8793f50d9d287a0c65abc863bad"
      width="239"> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
  Your answer may vary, but here is a sample</p>
<ul>
  <li> If we substitute 0 for \(x\) in the equation and solve for \(y\), we get \(\frac {75}{9}\) or \(8 \frac 13\) . That combination is the point
    \((0,8 \frac 13)\) or the \(y\)-intercept of the graph. If we substitute 0 for \(y\) in the equation and solve for \(x\), we
    get 12.5 for \(x\). That combination is the point (12.5,0) or the \(x\)-intercept of the graph.</li>
  <li>If we substitute the \(x\)- and \(y\)-values of any point on the graph in the equation, the equation remains true.</li>
  <li>If we rewrite the equation and solve for \(y\), we have \( y = \dfrac {75 - 6x}{9} \) or \( y = 8\frac13 - \frac23x \). The \( 8\frac13 \) matches where the graph
    intersects the \(y\)-axis and \( -\frac23\) matches the slope of the
    graph. (For every 3 additional pounds of almonds that Clare bought, she could buy 2 fewer pounds of figs.)</li>
  <li>From the graph, we can see that the \(y\)-intercept is \( (0,8\frac13) \) and the slope is \( -\frac23 \), so the equation of the line is
    \( y = 8\frac13 - \frac23x \). Multiplying each side of the equation by 9 (an acceptable move) gives an equivalent equation, \( 9y = 75 - 6x\), 
    which can be rewritten as \( 6x + 9y = 75\).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p> Focus the discussion on students&rsquo; explanations for the last question. If no one mentions that
  \( 6x+9y=75 \)   can be rearranged into an equivalent equation,
  \( y=8\frac13 -\frac23 x \)  , point this out. (Demonstrate the
  rearrangement process, if needed.)</p>
<p>Ask students if we can now see the  \( 8\frac13 \)  and the \( - \frac23 \)  on the graph and if so, where they are visible. To help students
  connect these values back to the quantities in the situation, ask what each value tells us about almonds and figs.
  Make sure students see that the  \( 8 \frac13 \)  tells us that if Clare
  bought no almonds, she could buy  \( 8\frac13 \)  pounds of figs. For every
  pound of almonds she buys, she can buy less figs&mdash; \( \frac23 \)  pound
  less, to be exact.</p>
