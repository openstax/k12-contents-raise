<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students compare graphs and statements that represent functions without a context. Because no
  concrete information is given, students need to rely on their understanding of function notation and points on a graph
  to make comparisons and to interpret intersections of the graphs.</p>
<p>Previously, students saw equations such as \(f(8)=g(8)\) and interpreted them in terms of a situation. Here, they
  begin to reason more abstractly about statements of the form \(f(x)=g(x)\) and relate it to one or more points where
  the graphs of \(f\) and \(g\) intersect. They see that a value of \(x\) that makes this equation true, or a solution
  to the equation, is the input value of such an intersection.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here are graphs that represent two functions, \(f\) and \(g\).</p>
<p><img alt="A graph with two curves: f, a black upward then downward parabola peaking at y equals 8, and g, a blue straight line sloping downward from y equals 8. The x-axis ranges from 0 to 12, and the y-axis ranges from 0 to 9." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/176b15619517ba5f9c3a25499139e7048af8b04b"/></p>
<p>Decide which function value is greater for each given input. Be prepared to explain your reasoning.
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>Which is greater, \(f(2)\) or \(g(2)\)</li>
<li>Which is greater, \(f(4)\) or \(g(4)\)</li>
<li>Which is greater, \(f(6)\) or \(g(6)\)</li>
<li>Which is greater, \(f(8)\) or \(g(8)\)</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p> <strong>Answer: </strong>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>\(g(2)\) is greater.</li>
<li>They appear to be equal.</li>
<li>\(f(6)\) is greater.</li>
<li>\(
      f(8)\) is greater.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
<li>Is there a value of \(x\) at which the equation \(f(x)=g(x)\) is true? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</li>
<p> <strong>Answer: </strong> Yes. For example: If the graphs intersect when \(x\) is 4 and when it is 9, then
    \(f(4)=g(4)\) and \(f(9)=g(9)\).</p>
<li>Identify at least two values of \(x\) at which the inequality \(f(x)&lt;g(x)\) is true.</li>
<p> <strong>Answer: </strong> For example: 1, 3, 10, 11, or other \(x\)-values that are less than 4 and greater than 9
  </p>
</ol>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Display the graphs of \(f\) and \(g\) for all to see. Invite students to share their responses to the first set of
  questions. As they point out the greater function value in each pair, mark the point on the graph and write a
  corresponding statement in function notation:</p>
<p>\(f(2)&lt;g(2)\), \(f(4)=g(4)\), \(f(6)&gt;g(6)\), and \(f(8)&gt;g(8)\). Emphasize that the function value that is
  greater in each pair has a higher vertical value on the coordinate plane for the same input value.</p>
<p>Next, discuss if there are values of \(x\) that make \(f(x)=g(x)\) true and how we can tell. Point out that earlier
  we wrote \(f(4)=g(4)\) because the values of (f\) and \(g\) are equal when the input is 4. This means that
  \((4,f(4))\) and \((4,g(4))\) are coordinates of the same point.</p>
<p>So, we can interpret an equation such as \(f(x)=g(x)\) to mean that the values of \(f\) and \(g\) are equal when the
  input is \(x\), and that \(x\) must be the horizontal value of the intersection of both graphs, which is a point that
  they share.</p>

        Incorrect. Let’s try again a different way: The graph of \(g\) is higher than the graph of \(f\) at

        That’s correct! Check yourself: When \(x=1\), both \(f\) and \(g\) equal –3.

        Incorrect. Let’s try again a different way: At \(x = -3\), \(f\) is higher than \(g\). The answer is

        Incorrect. Let’s try again a different way: At \(x =-1\), \(g\) is greater than \(f\). The answer is

<h4>Using Graphs to Find Values</h4>
<p>Two functions, \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\), are graphed below.</p>

<p><img alt="Graph showing two functions: f of x, a downward-opening parabola, and g of x, a straight downward-sloping line. Both intersect the y-axis above 0.

</p>
<p>Which is greater, \(f(1)\) or \(g(1)\)?</p>
<p>Write down your answer. Then select the<strong> Solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to determine which value is greater:</p>
<p>Looking at the graph, \(f(1)\) is where \(x=1\) reaches the graph of \(f(x)\). The \(y\)-value there is 4. So,
  \(f(1)=4\).</p>
<p>Similarly, \(g(1)\) is where \(x=1\) reaches the graph of \(g(x)\). The \(y\)-value there is 2.</p>
<p>So, \(f(1) &gt;g(1)\).</p>
