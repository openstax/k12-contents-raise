<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students recall how to calculate the slope between two points when given two coordinates or a table, using the slope formula; or with a graph, using knowledge of rise over run. Students will then use this knowledge to write equations of lines in slope-intercept form, point-slope form, and standard form. Equations will be written from two points or one point and a slope. Students practiced finding slope from a graph in 1.10 but have not formally found the slope when given two coordinates or from a table. Also in 1.10, students explored writing and graphing equations using standard form. In 1.11.3, students had the opportunity to write equations from standard form to slope-intercept form by solving for \(y\) to identify \(m\) and \(b\). They will still need practice converting equations into all three different, equivalent forms.</p>

<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p>
<ul>
  <li>ELPS 1(G) demonstrate an increasing ability to distinguish between formal and informal English and an increasing knowledge of when to use each one commensurate with grade-level learning expectations </li>
  <li>ELPS 4(C) develop basic sight vocabulary, derive meaning of environmental print, and comprehend English vocabulary and language structures used routinely in written classroom materials </li>
</ul>
<h4>Support for Building Character</h4>
<p>Throughout this unit, find ways to encourage and support students to work on cultivating their <strong>creativity</strong>.</p>
