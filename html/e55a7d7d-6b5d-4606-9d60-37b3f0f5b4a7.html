<h3>Cool Down Activity</h3>
<!--Question 1 -->

  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-content">
    <p>Here is a system of equations:<br></p>
    <p>\( \left\{ \begin{array}{c l} 12a + 5b = -15\\ 8a + b = 11\end{array}\right. \)</p>
    <p>1. To solve this system, Diego wrote these equivalent systems for his first two steps.</p>
    <p>Step 1</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>\( \left\{ \begin{array}{c l} 12a + 5b = -15\\ -40a + -5b = -55\end{array}\right. \)</p>
    <p>Step 2</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>\( \left\{ \begin{array}{c l} 12a + 5b = -15\\ -28a = -70\end{array}\right. \)</p>
    <p>Describe the move that Diego made to get each equivalent system. Be prepared to explain how you know the systems in Step 1 and Step 2 have the same solution as the original system.</p>

    <p>Compare your answer to the sample response:</p>
    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Multiply the second equation by -5. Multiplying each side of an equation by the same number gives an equivalent equation with the same solution.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the resulting equation to the first equation to eliminate the variable b. Adding an equal amount to each side of an equation keeps the two sides equal, so the solution for the first equation is also a solution for the sum.</p>

    <p>2. Write another set of equivalent systems (different than Diego's first two steps) that will allow one variable to be eliminated and enable you to solve the original system. Be prepared to describe the moves you make to create each new system and to explain why each one has the same solution as the original system.</p>

    <p><span>2. Multiply the second equation by&nbsp;\( \frac{3}{2} \)&nbsp;and then subtract the resulting equation from the first equation to eliminate the variable \( a \).</span></p>
    <p>\( \left\{ \begin{array}{c l} 12a + 5b = -15\\ 12a + \frac{3}{4}b = \frac{33}{2}\end{array}\right. \)</p>
    <p>\( \left\{ \begin{array}{c l} 12a + 5b = -15\\ \frac{7}{2}b = -\frac{63}{2}\end{array}\right. \)</p>
    <p>Multiply the first equation by -4 and the second equation by 6, and then add the two resulting equations to eliminate the variable \( a \).</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>\( \left\{ \begin{array}{c l} -14 - 20b = 60\\ 48a + 6b = 66\end{array}\right. \)</p>\( \left\{ \begin{array}{c l} -14b = 126\\ 48a + 6b = 66\end{array}\right. \)
