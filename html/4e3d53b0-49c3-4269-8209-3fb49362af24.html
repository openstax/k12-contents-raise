<h3>Warm Up (5 minute)</h3>
<p>The purpose of this warm up is to help students recall what a proportion is and how to solve a proportion. Elicit student strategies, such as scaling up/down numerators and denominators, and if students don&rsquo;t bring up cross-multiplication on their own, make sure to cover that strategy.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Remind students that they may have learned more than one way to solve these equations, and it is okay to use a variety of strategies.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Solve each of the following proportions: </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> \( \frac{x}{56} = \frac{7}{8} \) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=49\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li> \( \frac{56}{72} = \frac{y}{9} \)<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>\(y=7\) </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li> \( \frac{98}{154} = \frac{-7}{p} \) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(p= -11\)</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Show different work examples. Who used cross-multiplication? Who used their multiplication facts to find the missing value?</li>
  <li>Can you think of situations in real life where you use proportions?</li>
</ul>
