<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Explain how the \(b\) in \(ax^2+bx+c\) affects the graph of the equation. </li>
  <li> Match equations given in standard and factored form with their graph. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the activities that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 7.13.1: Equivalent Expressions </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you compared standard and factored forms of quadratic equations and made observations about the two types of forms. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 7.13.2: The Linear Term in a Quadratic Expression </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you looked at different quadratic equations of the form \(f(x)=x^2+bx\) and \(f(x)=x^2+c\) and identified the \(x\)-intercepts and vertex. </li>
    <li> 7.13.2: Self Check </li>
    <li> 7.13.2: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 7.13.3: Writing Equations that Represent a Graph </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you used graphing technology to find the equation that would graph a quadratic function through three given points. </li>
    <li> 7.13.3: Self Check </li>
    <li> 7:13.3: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 7.13.4: Graphing Quadratic Equations </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you graphed quadratic functions in different forms by identifying the \(x\)-intercepts and vertex. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following practice:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 7.13.5: Practice </li>
