<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>So far, the quadratic expressions that students have transformed from standard form to factored form have at least a squared term and a linear term. In this lesson, students encounter quadratic expressions without a linear term and consider how to write them in factored form.</p>
<p>Students begin by studying numerical examples and noticing that expressions such as \((20 + 1)(20 &minus; 1)\) and \(20^2&minus; 1^2\) (which is a difference of two squares) are equivalent. Students are able to generalize the equivalence of these two forms as \((x + m)(x &minus; m) = x^2&minus; m^2\). Then, they rewrite these expressions from one form to the other.</p>
<p>Along the way, they encounter a variety of quadratic expressions that can be seen as differences of two squares, including those in which the squared term has a coefficient other than 1, and expressions that involve fractions.</p>
<p>Students also consider why a difference of two squares (such as \(x^2&minus; 25\)) can be written in factored form, but a sum of two squares (such as \(x^2 + 25\)) cannot be, even though both are quadratic expressions with no linear term.</p>
<p>Remind students that when they want to enter a number with an exponent, they should use the ^ symbol. It will look like "\(x^2\)" when they want to enter \(x^2\). To make the ^ symbol, push shift and the numeral 6 at the same time.</p>
<p>After this lesson, students will have the tools they need to solve factorable quadratic equations given in standard form by first rewriting them in factored form. That work begins in the next lesson.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Explain that multiplying binomials that are a sum and a difference, \((x + m)(x &minus; m)\), results in a quadratic with no linear term and explain (orally) why this is the case. </li>
  <li> Write equivalent expressions in factored form when given quadratic expressions that are the difference of squares. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Explain why multiplying binomials that are a sum and a difference, \((x + m)(x &minus; m)\), results in a quadratic expression with no linear term. </li>
  <li> Rewrite a quadratic expression of the form \(x^2&minus; c\) into its factored form. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
 <p>
Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p>

 <ul>
   <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment     </li>
   <li>ELPS 3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions     </li>
   <li>ELPS 4(G) demonstrate comprehension of increasingly complex English by participating in shared reading, retelling, or summarizing material, responding to questions, and taking notes commensurate with content area and grade level needs</li>
 </ul>
