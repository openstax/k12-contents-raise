<h4>Interpreting Equations in Function Notation</h4>
<p>What does a statement like \(p(3)=12\) mean?</p>
<p>On its own, \(p(3)=12\) only tells us that when \(p\) takes 3 as its input, its output is 12.</p>
<p>If we know what quantities the input and output represent, however, we can learn much more about the situation that the function represents.</p>
<p>If function \(p\) gives the perimeter of a square whose side length is \(x\) and both measurements are in inches, then we can interpret \(p(3)=12\) to mean &ldquo;a square whose side length is 3 inches has a perimeter of 12 inches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We can also interpret statements like \(p(x)=32\) to mean &ldquo;a square with side length \(x\) has a perimeter of 32 inches,&rdquo; which then allows us to reason that \(x\) must be 8 inches and to write \(p(8)=32\).</p>
<p>If function \(p\) gives the number of blog subscribers, in thousands, \(x\) months after a blogger started publishing online, then \(p(3)=12\) means &ldquo;3 months after a blogger started publishing online, the blog has 12,000 subscribers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is important to pay attention to the units of measurement when analyzing a function. Otherwise, we might mistake what is happening in the situation. If we miss that \(p(x)\) is measured in thousands, we might misinterpret \(p(36)\) to mean &ldquo;there are 36 blog subscribers after \(x\) months,&rdquo; while it actually means &ldquo;after 36 months, there are \(x\) thousands of blog subscribers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here is how to interpret the function notation in the equation:</p>
<p>Since \(A\) gives the area and 8 is the input, a square with side length of 8 centimeters has an area of 64 \(cm^2\).</p>
