<h4><span>Activity (20 minutes)</span><br></h4>
<p>Earlier, students encountered the idea of equivalent systems. They described the moves that lead to equivalent equations and explained why the solution to those equations was the same as the solution to the original system. This activity reinforces that work.</p>
<p>Given an unordered set of equivalent systems, students work with a partner to arrange the systems such that the order constitutes logical steps toward solving an original system. Along the way, they take turns describing how each system came from the previous one and explaining how they know it has the same solution as its predecessor. The work allows students to practice constructing logical arguments and critiquing those of others.</p>
<p>Here is an image of the cards for reference and planning.</p>

<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Give one set of pre-cut slips or cards from the blackline master to each group. Ask students to find the slip or card that shows a system of equations and is labeled "Start here."</p>
<p>Explain that all the other slips contain equivalent systems that represent steps in solving the starting system. Ask students to arrange the slips in the order that would lead to its solution, and to make sure they can explain what moves take each system to the next system and why each system is equivalent to the one before it.</p>
<p>Partners should take turns finding the next step in the solving process and explaining their reasoning. As one student explains, the partner's job is to listen and make sure they agree and the explanation makes sense. If they disagree, the partners should discuss until they reach an agreement.</p>
<p>Give students 5 minutes to arrange the systems. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<p>Your teacher will give you some slips of paper with systems of equations written on them. Each system represents a step in solving this system:</p>
<p>\( \begin {cases}\frac45 x + 6y = 15\\ \text-x + 18y = 11 \end{cases} \)</p>

<h4>Student-Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>This system of equations has the solution&nbsp;\( (5,\text-2) \):&nbsp;\( \begin {cases}Ax - By = 24\\ Bx + Ay = 31 \end{cases} \)</p>
<p>Find the missing values&nbsp;\( A \)&nbsp;and&nbsp;\( B \).</p>
<h4>Extension Student Response</h4>
<p>&nbsp;\( A = 2 \),&nbsp;\( B = 7 \)<br></p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students who are thinking algorithmically about solving systems of equations may think that the first step should involve multiplying each side of the second equation by \( \frac{4}{5} \), becoming frustrated when no cards show that step. Encourage them to compare both the first and the second equations in the starting card to the first and second equations on other cards to gain some ideas about what steps might have been taken.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis
</h4>
<p>Ask students to share the order in which the systems should be arranged to lead to the solution. Display the ordered systems for all to see.</p>
<p>Point out to students that this particular solution path involves multiplying each of the two equations by a factor in order to eliminate the \( x \)-variable. Ask students if it's possible to eliminate a variable by multiplying only one equation by a factor. (Yes, we could multiply the first equation by&nbsp;\( \frac{5}{4} \) to eliminate \( x \), or by 3 to eliminate y. Or we could multiply the second equation by \( \frac{4}{5} \) to eliminate \( x \), or by \( \frac{1}{3} \) to eliminate \( y \).)</p>
<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>

  <p><span lang="EN">Use this routine to support student conversation as they
      take turns selecting cards and explaining how each system came from the
      previous one. Display the following prompts for students to use as they respond
      to reasoning shared by the partner who selected the card: &ldquo;I agree because&hellip;.&rdquo;
      or &ldquo;I disagree because&hellip;.&rdquo; Encourage students not only to challenge each other
      if they disagree with the card selected, but also to press for clear
      explanations that use mathematical language.</span></p>
