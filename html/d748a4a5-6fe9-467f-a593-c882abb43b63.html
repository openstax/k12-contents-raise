<h4>Activity (20 minutes)<br></h4>
<p>Earlier, students encountered the idea of equivalent systems. They described the moves that lead to equivalent equations and explained why the solution to those equations was the same as the solution to the original system. This activity reinforces that work.</p>
<p>Given an unordered set of equivalent systems, students work with a partner to arrange the systems such that the order constitutes logical steps toward solving an original system. Along the way, they take turns describing how each system came from the previous one and explaining how they know it has the same solution as its predecessor. The work allows students to practice constructing logical arguments and critiquing those of others.</p>
<p>Here is an image of the cards for reference and planning.</p>
<p><a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/91ab017eb03d410c7913332368447589cc19517b"><img alt="Sample image of card sheet used for activity." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="467" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4839ff4fed388fea8259fd3a237d649c4f8ad71e" width="400"></a><br></p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Give one set of pre-cut slips or cards from the <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/91ab017eb03d410c7913332368447589cc19517b">blackline master</a> to each group. Ask students to find the slip or card that shows a system of equations and is labeled "Start here."</p>
<p>Explain that all the other slips contain equivalent systems that represent steps in solving the starting system. Ask students to arrange the slips in the order that would lead to its solution, and to make sure they can explain what moves take each system to the next system and why each system is equivalent to the one before it.</p>
<p>Partners should take turns finding the next step in the solving process and explaining their reasoning. As one student explains, the partner's job is to listen and make sure they agree and the explanation makes sense. If they disagree, the partners should discuss until they reach an agreement.</p>
<p>Give students 5 minutes to arrange the systems. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Your teacher will give you some slips of paper with systems of equations written on them. Each system represents a step in solving this system:<br>
  <br>
  \( \begin {cases}\frac45 x + 6y = 15\\ \text-x + 18y = 11 \end{cases} \)<br>
</p>
<p>Arrange the slips in the order that would lead to a solution. Be prepared to:</p>

<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>This system of equations has the solution&nbsp;\( (5,\text-2) \):&nbsp;\( \begin {cases}Ax - By = 24\\ Bx + Ay = 31 \end{cases} \)</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong>\( A = 2 \)</p>
<p>2. Find the missing value of&nbsp;\( B \).</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>\( B = 7 \)</p>


<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students who are thinking algorithmically about solving systems of equations may think that the first step should involve multiplying each side of the second equation by \( \frac{4}{5} \), becoming frustrated when no cards show that step. Encourage them to compare both the first and the second equations in the starting card to the first and second equations on other cards to gain some ideas about what steps might have been taken.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis
</h4>
<p>Ask students to share the order in which the systems should be arranged to lead to the solution. Display the ordered systems for all to see.</p>
<p>Point out to students that this particular solution path involves multiplying each of the two equations by a factor in order to eliminate the \( x \)-variable. Ask students if it's possible to eliminate a variable by multiplying only one equation by a factor. (Yes, we could multiply the first equation by&nbsp;\( \frac{5}{4} \) to eliminate \( x \), or by 3 to eliminate y. Or we could multiply the second equation by \( \frac{4}{5} \) to eliminate \( x \), or by \( \frac{1}{3} \) to eliminate \( y \).)</p>

<h4>Solving a System of Equations by Elimination Involving Fractions</h4>
<p>You just ordered the steps for solving a system of equations using elimination. Try
    using these steps when the system has equations containing fractions.</p>
<p>When the system of equations contains fractions, we will first clear the fractions by
    multiplying each equation by the least common denominator (LCD) of all the
    fractions in the equation.</p>
