<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Simplify radical expressions with even and odd indexes. </li>
<li> Rewrite expressions with rational exponents as roots. </li>
<li> Use properties of exponents with rational exponents. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li> 5.2.1: Perfect Squares Revisited </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you were reminded of perfect squares and how they are related to repeated multiplication and square roots. You looked at which operations were equivalent and which ones were inverses of each other. </li>
</ul>
<li> 5.2.2: The nth Root <ul>
<li> In this activity, you analyzed what happens to negative numbers when they are raised to an odd and even power. You were also introduced to new vocabulary such as radical, index, and radicand and discovered how they are related to perfect squares and square roots. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>5.2.2: Self Check</span><br></li>
<li> 5.2.3: Radicals and Rational Exponents <ul>
<li> In this activity, you extended radicals and root indices even further by looking at rational exponents. You rewrote expressions from radical form to rational exponent form. </li>

<li> 5.2.4: Properties of Exponents with Rationals </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you applied the properties of exponents to expressions with rational exponents. You were able to practice using the same properties of exponents from an earlier lesson. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
