<h4> Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>The purpose of this lesson is for students to understand what makes a sequence a geometric sequence and to begin to
  connect that idea with their learning about exponential functions in an earlier course. The lesson also gives students
  the opportunity to use precise language to describe the relationship between consecutive terms in a sequence&mdash;in
  particular, how the terms of a geometric sequence grow by the same factor from one term to the next. For example, this
  is a geometric sequence: 0.5, 2, 8, 32, 128, . . . Each term is 4 times the previous term. Two ways to think about how
  you know the sequence is geometric are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Each term is multiplied by a factor of 4 to get the next term.
  </li>
  <li>
    The ratio of each term and the previous term is 4.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>We call 4 the common ratio or the growth factor. After considering some examples of geometric sequences in the
  warm-up and how they are similar, students then develop two different sequences from the context of continually
  cutting a piece of paper in half. Using tables and graphs to identify the common ratio of these sequences, geometric
  sequences are defined. Next, students practice calculating missing terms of geometric sequences by first identifying
  the common ratio.</p>
<p>In an earlier course, students encountered the idea of functions and studied exponential functions specifically. Some
  students may see that a geometric sequence is simply an exponential function whose outputs are the terms and whose
  inputs are the positions of the terms. Later lessons will elaborate on this idea. This lesson invites recall of those
  ideas with a light touch by referring to, for example, "the size of each piece as a function of the number of cuts"
  and by using the term common ratio rather than common ratio. Students are also asked to describe how graphs
  representing each quantity in the paper cutting context are the same and different, and in so doing may recall prior
  knowledge of the behavior of exponential functions. In the last activity, the connection is made explicit.</p>
<p>A note on language and notation: In earlier courses, students may have learned that a ratio is an association between
  two or more quantities. In more advanced work, such as this course, &ldquo;ratio&rdquo; is typically used as a synonym
  for &ldquo;quotient.&rdquo; This expanded use of the word &ldquo;ratio&rdquo; comes into play in this lesson with the
  introduction of the term &ldquo;common ratio.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 4.14.5: Practice.</p>
<h4>Required Materials</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Sheets of 8-inch by 10-inch paper
  </li>
  <li>
    Scissors
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Required Preparation</h4>
<p>Scissors and pieces of paper will be needed if students will physically carry out the paper cutting instead of
  observing how the paper-cutting would look. If using, prepare one pair of scissors and one 8 inch by 10 inch piece of
  blank paper for every two students.&nbsp;</p>
<h4> Lesson Vocabulary</h4>
<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson. Encourage students to look for
    these words and notice their use and meanings.
  </li>
  <li>
    Encourage students to use key vocabulary words in &ldquo;math talk&rdquo; and their written and oral explanations.
  </li>
  <li>
    Utilize a word wall. Sample cards are located here: <a
