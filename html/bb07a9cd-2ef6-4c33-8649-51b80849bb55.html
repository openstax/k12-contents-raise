<p dir="ltr"></p><h3>Activity</h3>
<div>
<p>40 minutes</p>
<p>The mathematical purpose of this
 activity is for students to collect, summarize, interpret, and draw 
conclusions from bivariate data using scatter plots, best fit lines, 
residuals and correlation coefficients. Students measure the approximate
 lengths of the humerus bone and height of their classmates to collect 
data and create a linear model. The model is then used to approximate 
the height of an ancient human based on the length of a found humerus 
bone.</p>
<p>Making graphing technology 
available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools 
strategically (MP5). By collecting their own data and using a best fit 
line to find additional information, students are modeling with 
mathematics (MP4).</p>
</div>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<div>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2 
to 4. Present the task to students and ask students to brainstorm 
different ways that they could answer the question. After 2 minutes of 
quiet think time, ask students to share their ideas with the class. The 
remaining time should be used by students to collect, analyze, 
summarize, and interpret the data.</p>

<em>Speaking, Reading: MLR5 Co-Craft Questions.</em>
 Use this routine to help students further interpret and increase 
awareness of the language used to talk about scatter plots, best fit 
lines, residuals and correlation coefficients. Display the first 
sentence of this problem ("An anthropologist finds a fossilized humerus 
bone of an ancient human ancestor."), and ask students to write down 
possible mathematical questions that could be asked about the situation.
 Invite students to compare their questions before revealing the 
remainder of the question. Listen for and amplify any questions 
involving comparing bivariate data.<br></div><div><em><br></em>

<h3>Student Facing Statement</h3>
<div>
<div><img alt="Arm skeletal system" height="432" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/94d8f9fd69e17df2daf533e213efd1530dcd62bf" width="276"></div>
<p>An anthropologist finds a fossilized humerus bone of an ancient human
 ancestor. The humerus is an arm bone running from the shoulder to the 
elbow. It is 24 centimeters in length. Use data from your classmates to 
estimate the height of this ancient human.</p>
</div>
<h3>Student Response</h3>
<div>
<p>Sample response: About 123 centimeters (around 4 feet). I measured 
the humerus and height of several classmates and created a scatter plot.
 I used a plot of the residuals and found that a linear model seemed to 
be appropriate. I then found the line of best fit to be about \( y = 5.1 x + 0.2 \), where \( y \) is the height in centimeters and \( x \) is the length of the humerus in centimeters. Using 24 centimeters for \( x \), I found that \( 5.1 \cdot 24 + 0.2 = 122.6 \), which I rounded since this is a rough estimate.</p>
</div>
<h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>
<div>
<p>Students may find it difficult to start to answer the question. Ask 
students what are the variables given in the situation. Ask students if 
there is a way we could collect information from people in the classroom
 to help answer the question.</p>
</div>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<div>
<p>The purpose of this discussion is for students to communicate how they used mathematics to justify their findings.</p>
<p>Ask students:</p>
<ul><li>"How confident are you in your answer? What information helped 
you determine your confidence?" (Not very confident. Since the 
correlation coefficient is near 0.6, there is only a moderate 
relationship between height and humerus length. Additionally, this 
ancient human ancestor may have a different anatomy-for example, apes 
tend to have proportionally longer arms than humans do.)</li>
<li>"How did you use mathematics to estimate the height of the ancient 
human?" (First, I collected data on the height and the approximate 
length of the humerus of my classmates. I then made a scatter plot to 
determine whether or not a linear model was appropriate, and then 
computed a line of best fit. I substituted 24 centimeters into my line 
of best fit and obtained my answer.)</li>
<li>"Do you think that the way you measured the humerus of your 
classmates impacted your choice of linear model? Explain your 
reasoning." (Yes, I think that I probably overestimated the bone length,
 because I was measuring from the outside and not the inside. I think 
that my model likely overestimates height.)</li>
