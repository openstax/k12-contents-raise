<h4>Activity (40 min)</h4>

  <p>The mathematical purpose of this activity is for students to collect, summarize, interpret, and draw
    conclusions from bivariate data using scatter plots, best fit lines,
    residuals and correlation coefficients. Students measure the approximate
    lengths of the humerus bone and height of their classmates to collect
    data and create a linear model. The model is then used to approximate
    the height of an ancient human based on the length of a found humerus
    bone.</p>
  <p>Making graphing technology
    available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools
    strategically (TEKS 1C and 1D). By collecting their own data and using a best fit
    line to find additional information, students are modeling with
    mathematics (TEKS 1C and 1D).</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Arrange students in groups of 2 to 4.</li> 
    <li>Present the task to students and ask students to brainstorm different ways that they could answer the question.</li> 
    <li>After 2 minutes of quiet time to think individually, ask students to share their ideas with the class. </li>
    <li>The remaining time should be used by students to collect, analyze, summarize, and interpret the data.</li>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<div>
  <div><img alt="Arm skeletal system" height="432" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/94d8f9fd69e17df2daf533e213efd1530dcd62bf" width="276"></div>
  <p>An anthropologist finds a fossilized humerus bone of an ancient human
    ancestor. The humerus is an arm bone running from the shoulder to the
    elbow. It is 24 centimeters in length. Use data from your classmates to
    estimate the height of this ancient human.</p>
</div>
<h3>Student Response</h3>
<div>
  <p>For example: About 123 centimeters (around 4 feet). I measured
    the humerus and height of several classmates and created a scatter plot.
    I used a plot of the residuals and found that a linear model seemed to
    be appropriate. I then found the line of best fit to be about \( y = 5.1 x + 0.2 \), where \( y \) is the height in centimeters and \( x \) is the length of the humerus in centimeters. Using 24 centimeters for \( x \), I found that \( 5.1 \cdot 24 + 0.2 = 122.6 \), which I rounded since this is a rough estimate.</p>
</div>
<h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>
<div>
  <p>Students may find it difficult to start to answer the question. Ask
    students what are the variables given in the situation. Ask students if
    there is a way we could collect information from people in the classroom
    to help answer the question.</p>
</div>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<div>
  <p>The purpose of this discussion is for students to communicate how they used mathematics to justify their findings.</p>
  <p><strong>Use the following questions to lead a discussion</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>"How confident are you in your answer? What information helped
      you determine your confidence?" (Not very confident. Since the
      correlation coefficient is near 0.6, there is only a moderate
      relationship between height and humerus length. Additionally, this
      ancient human ancestor may have a different anatomy-for example, apes
      tend to have proportionally longer arms than humans do.)</li>
    <li>"How did you use mathematics to estimate the height of the ancient
      human?" (First, I collected data on the height and the approximate
      length of the humerus of my classmates. I then made a scatter plot to
      determine whether or not a linear model was appropriate, and then
      computed a line of best fit. I substituted 24 centimeters into my line
      of best fit and obtained my answer.)</li>
    <li>"Do you think that the way you measured the humerus of your
      classmates impacted your choice of linear model? Explain your
      reasoning." (Yes, I think that I probably overestimated the bone length,
      because I was measuring from the outside and not the inside. I think
      that my model likely overestimates height.)</li>
  </ul>
