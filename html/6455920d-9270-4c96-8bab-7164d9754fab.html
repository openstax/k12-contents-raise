<h3>Activity: P9.2: Analyzing a Dive</h3>
<p>The function \(h\), defined by \(h(t)=âˆ’5t^2+10t+7.5\), models the height of a diver above the water (in meters) \(t\) seconds after the diver leaves the board. For each question, explain your reasoning.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> How high above the water is the diving board? </li>
  <li> When does the diver hit the water? </li>
  <li> At what point during her descent toward the water is the diver at the same height as the diving board? </li>
  <li> When does the diver reach the maximum height of the dive? </li>
  <li> What is the maximum height the diver reaches during the dive? </li>
</ol>
