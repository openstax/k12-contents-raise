    <li>Which inequality represents the graph?</li>
  </ol>
  <img alt="graph of y &lt; 3x &minus; 4" class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="409" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/8f554c15c06d4fbb6743789abf840d7e817b0442" width="400"><br>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>\( y \leq 3x &minus; 4 \)</li>
    <li>\( y &lt; 3x &minus; 4 \)</li>
    <li> \( y &gt; 3x &minus; 4 \)</li>
    <li>\( y \geq 3x &minus; 4 \)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( y &lt; 3x &minus; 4 \)</p>
  <p>The graph has a dotted line, so any answers that have \(\geq\) or\(\leq\) can be eliminated. <br>
  The two remaining options are \(y&gt;3x−4\) and \(y&gt;3x−4\).<br>
  If we set \(x\) to 0, we can see that the \(y\)-coordinate is -4. Look at the shading in the graph to determine if \(y&gt;-4\) or \(y&gt;-4\). The graph is shaded to the right and down so \(y&gt;-4\). Therefore the equation \(y&gt;3x−4\) is the correct answer.</p>
  
  <p>For questions 10 and 11, use this  graph of the equation \(2y−x=1\) as a guide to answer the questions.</p>

  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="10">
    <li>Is the point \( (0,\frac{1}{2}) \) a solutions to the equation?</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes<br>
  </p>
  <p>Substitute the ordered pair \((0, \frac{1}{2})\) into the equation  \(2y−x=1\) to determine if the coordinates make it a true statement, which makes it a solution. <br>
  \(2(\frac{1}{2})−0=1\)<br>
  \(1-0=1\)<br>
  \(1=1\)<br>
  1 equals 1. Yes it is a solution because the equation is true.
  </p>
  
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="11">
    <li>Is the point \((0,2)\) a solution to the inequality \(2y &minus;
      x &gt; 1\)?</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes</p>
  <p>Substitute the ordered pair \((0, 2)\) into the inequality \(2y−x&gt;1\) to determine if the coordinates make it a true statement, which makes it a solution. <br>
  \(2(2)−0&gt;1\)<br>
  \(4-0&gt;1\)<br>

  4 is greater than 1. Yes it is a solution because the inequality is true.

  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="12">
    <li>Consider the linear equation \(2y &minus; 3x = 5\). The pair \((-1,1)\) is a solution to the equation. Which of
      the following is also a solution to the equation?</li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>\(
      (1, 5)\) </li>
    <li> \((3, 7)\) </li>
    <li> \((5, 11)\) </li>
    <li> \((-3, -1)\) </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> \((3, 7)\)</p>
  <p>Substitute the ordered pair \((3, 7)\) into the equation \(2y−3x=5\) to determine if the coordinates make it a true statement, which makes it a solution. <br>
  \(2(7)−3(3)=5\)<br>
  \(14-9=5\)<br>
  \(5=5\)<br>
  5 equals 5. The ordered pair (3, 7) is a solution because the equation is true.</p>
  
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="13">
    <li>The boundary line on the graph represents the equation \( 5x + 2y = 6\). Write an inequality that is represented by the graph.</li>
  </ol>
  <img alt="graph with boundary line that represents the equation 5x + 2y = 6" class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="262" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/a9a4189f06a5a2df644f610859ad8385a70f7031" width="262"><br>

  <ul>
    <li> \(5x + 2y &lt; -6\) </li>
    <li> \(-5x - 2y &lt; 6\) </li>
    <li> \(5x + 2y &lt; 2\) </li>
    <li>\( 5x + 2y &lt; 6\) </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>\(5x + 2y &lt; 6 \)</p>
  <p>The graph is shaded to the left and down and it crosses the \(y\)-axis at 3, so the solution has to show the 
  \(y&gt;3\) when \(x=0\).<br>
  If we plug in 0 into the inequality \(5x+2y&gt;6\)<br>
  \(5(0)+2y&gt;6\)<br>
  \(2y&gt;6\)<br>
  \(y&gt;3\)</p>
