<h4>Determining the Meaning of a Point on a Graph</h4>
<p>The graph below shows the relationship between a rectangle&rsquo;s side length and area.</p>
<p><img alt="Points plotted. Horizontal axis, length in inches, 0 to 10. Vertical axis, area in square inches, 0 to 32. Selected points at 2 comma 18, 3 comma 24, 5 comma 30, 6 comma 30, 8 comma 24, 10 comma 10." src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/im-ims-export/teFFXpeFbrjfeT2iJkotbnJT"></p>
<p>What does the point \((7, 28)\) mean in the situation?</p>
<p>The \(x\)-axis represents the length of the rectangle in inches. So, when \(x=7\), the rectangle has a side length of 7 inches.</p>
<p>The \(y\)-axis represents the area of the rectangle. So, when \(y=28\), the rectangle has an area of 28 square inches.</p>
<p>This also means the rectangle has a width of 4 inches since \(7 \times 4=28\).</p>

<p>Here is how to determine the meaning of the point \((3, 24)\) and the width of the rectangle:</p>
<p>Since the \(x\)-axis is the length of the rectangle in inches, \(x=3\) represents the length of the rectangle is 3 inches. Since the \(y\)-axis represents the area in square inches, the area of the rectangle is 24 square inches.</p>
<p>This means the width of the rectangle must be 8 inches since \(3 \times 8 = 24\).</p>
