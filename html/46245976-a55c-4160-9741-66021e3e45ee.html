<p><strong><em>Students will complete the following questions to practice the skills they have learned in this lesson.</em></strong></p>

<li>Here is a graph of \(p\), an insect population, \(w\) weeks after it was first measured. The population grows exponentially. [Teacher note: Graph is drawn to scale, but students may have trouble since at \(t=0\), \(p=300\), and that is not marked on the graph. Students are forced to find the growth factor and work backward.]<br>
