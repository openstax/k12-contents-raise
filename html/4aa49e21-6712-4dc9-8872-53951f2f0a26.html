<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm up prompts students to carefully analyze and compare features of graphs of linear equations. In making comparisons, students have a reason to use language precisely. The activity also enables the teacher to hear the terminology students know and learn how they talk about characteristics of graphs.</p>
<p>The work here prepares students to reason about solutions to equations by graphing, which is the focus of this lesson.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2 – 4. Display the graphs for all to see.</p>
<p>Give students 1 minute of quiet time to think individually and then time to share their thinking with their small group. In their small groups, ask each student to share their reasoning as to why a particular graph does not belong, and together find at least one reason each item doesn’t belong.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Which one doesn’t belong?</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="A">
<li><img alt="Line graph with x-axis labeled hours and y-axis labeled dollars; a straight line rises diagonally from the origin, showing a positive linear relationship between hours and dollars." height="84" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/ce28f588a2cb1bf8e7630ac1ebb0d8ccb95750be" width="93"/>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> is the only graph that intersects the vertical axis at 0 (or that starts at the origin).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2" type="A">
<li> <img alt="A simple line graph with hours labeled on the y-axis and dollars on the x-axis. The line slopes upward, showing hours increasing as dollars increase." height="84" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/15f98a6021fbf93233ef7bf2f64a3205285f1c69" width="93"/>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> is the only graph where the horizontal axis represents dollars and the vertical axis represents hours.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3" type="A">
<li> <img alt="A graph with hours on the x-axis and dollars on the y-axis shows a dotted upward-sloping line, indicating an increase in dollars as hours increase." height="84" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/ac94abdebfe8dfae574d3d13fdb604a25b86bf75" width="93"/>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> is the only one that shows plotted points (which lie along a line) instead of a continuous line.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4" type="A">
<li> <img alt="A line graph with dollars on the vertical axis and hours on the horizontal axis. The line slopes downward, indicating that as hours increase, dollars decrease." height="84" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/492725157748b37a25d85edb6015c50e4ef6b332" width="93"/>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> is the only one with a negative slope (or which slants downward from left to right).</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Ask each group to share one reason why a particular item does not belong. Record and display the responses for all to see. After each response, ask the class if they agree or disagree. Since there is no single correct answer to the question of which one does not belong, attend to students’ explanations and ensure the reasons given are correct.</p>
<p>During the discussion, ask students to explain the meaning of any terminology they use, such as “<span class="math math-repaired">\( y \)</span>-intercept” or “negative slope.” Also, press students on unsubstantiated claims. (For example, if a student claims that graph A is the only one with a slope greater than 1, ask them to explain or show how they know.)</p>
