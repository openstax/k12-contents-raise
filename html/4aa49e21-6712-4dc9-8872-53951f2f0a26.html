<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
  <p>This warm-up prompts students to carefully analyze and compare features of graphs of linear equations. In making comparisons, students have a reason to use language precisely. The activity also enables the teacher to hear the terminology students know and learn how they talk about characteristics of graphs.</p>
  <p>The work here prepares students to reason about solutions to equations by graphing, which is the focus of this lesson.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
  <p>Arrange students in groups of 2&ndash;4. Display the graphs for all to see.</p>
  <p>Give students 1 minute of quiet time to think individually and then time to share their thinking with their small group. In their small groups, ask each student to share their reasoning as to why a particular graph does not belong, and together find at least one reason each item doesn&rsquo;t belong.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
  <p>Which one doesn&rsquo;t belong?</p>
          <p>A</p>
          <img alt="A line graphed on a set of axes, origin O. Hours versus dollars. The line starts at O and extends up and to the right at a somewhat steep angle." height="84" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/ce28f588a2cb1bf8e7630ac1ebb0d8ccb95750be" width="93">
          <p>B</p>
          <img alt="Graph of a line. Vertical axis, hours. Horizontal axis, dollars." height="84" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/15f98a6021fbf93233ef7bf2f64a3205285f1c69" width="93">
          <p>C</p>
          <img alt="Graph of 12 plotted points. Vertical axis, dollars. Horizontal axis, hours." height="84" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/ac94abdebfe8dfae574d3d13fdb604a25b86bf75" width="93">
          <p>D</p>
          <img alt="Graph of a line. Vertical axis, dollars. Horizontal axis, hours." height="84" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/492725157748b37a25d85edb6015c50e4ef6b332" width="93">

        <br>      
<h4>Student Response</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>A is the only graph that intersects the vertical axis at 0 (or that starts at the <span>origin</span>).</li>
    <li>B is the only graph where the horizontal axis represents dollars and the vertical axis represents hours.</li>
    <li>C is the only one that shows plotted points (which lie along a line) instead of a continuous line.</li>
    <li>D is the only one with a negative slope (or which slants downward from left to right).</li>
  </ul>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
  <p>Ask each group to share one reason why a particular item does not belong. Record and display the responses for all to see. After each response, ask the class if they agree or disagree. Since there is no single correct answer to the question of which one does not belong, attend to students&rsquo; explanations and ensure the reasons given are correct.</p>
  <p>During the discussion, ask students to explain the meaning of any terminology they use, such as &ldquo;<span class="math math-repaired">\( y \)</span>-intercept&rdquo; or &ldquo;negative slope.&rdquo; Also, press students on unsubstantiated claims. (For example, if a student claims that graph A is the only one with a slope greater than 1, ask them to explain or show how they know.)</p>
