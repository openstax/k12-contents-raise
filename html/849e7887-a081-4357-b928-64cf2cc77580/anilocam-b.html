<p>In this lesson, you will add equations in standard form to eliminate one of the variables. This will allow you to solve for the remaining variable. You can then use that value to determine the value of the other variable. Ultimately, you will be able to see the relationship between the graph and solution of the system of equations.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>Below are the knowledge and skills you will practice in this lesson. Before you begin, read each one and rate how much you currently know about each one. It&rsquo;s okay if your ratings are low; the purpose of this is to check in with yourself about what you do or do not yet know.</p>
<p><strong>Can you...</strong></p>
