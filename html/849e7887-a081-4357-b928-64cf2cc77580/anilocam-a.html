<p>In this lesson, you will add equations in standard form to eliminate one of the variables. This will allow you to solve for the remaining variable. You can then use that value to determine the value of the other variable. Ultimately, you will be able to see the relationship between the graph and solution of the system of equations.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Solve systems of equations by adding or subtracting them to eliminate a variable.</li>
  <li>Know that adding or subtracting equations in a system creates a new equation, where one of the solutions to this equation is the solution to the system.</li>
</ul>
