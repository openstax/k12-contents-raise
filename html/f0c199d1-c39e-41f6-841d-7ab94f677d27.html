<h3>Project Activity (15 minutes)</h3>

<p>This activity will get students interacting directly with a function so they can discover the basic principles of a function. It is important that students can name the parts of a function, come up with an initial definition of a function, be able to describe a function, and see that a function always behaves consistently. </p>

<h3>Launch</h3>

<p><li>Allow students to work independently to answer questions on their activity sheet, stopping where indicated to have small-group or whole-class discussions.</li></p>
<p><li>Circulate as students work on Part 2 of the activity sheet, noting interesting responses. After you notice that groups have discussed #2, pause and bring the class together for a whole-class discussion. </li></p>
<p><li>Call on groups to share out some of their names. Write them on the board. If there are a lot of responses, circle a few that you will agree mean input, output, and function or operation.Allow students the freedom to use the names they prefer.</li></p>

<p><li>After you notice that individuals have finished #3, pause and bring the class together for a whole-class discussion.</li> </p>
<p><li>Call on students to share out their definitions in #3. Lead class in combining the various answers to write a definition as a class. </li></p>
<p><li>When you notice groups discussing #4, give a 2 minutes time warning.</li></p>

<h4>Part 2: What is a function?</h4>

<p>In this activity, whenever you see &#128172;, stop and share your responses with your partner. If you have different responses, try to come to a consensus.
</p>

<p>You may have noticed that all of the simulation screens share a three-part structure. These three parts can be described in a variety of ways, such as the ones listed in the image below. </p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent"><p><li>Come up with your own names for the three parts of a function.</li>
  <br>
  <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
Answers will vary. 
<br>
    Students are asked to generate names for the input images, the output images, and the function itself. Examples might include:<br>

    <ul>
      <li>Front loader, inserts, domain, original, start</li>
      <li>processor, machine, coder, producer, action</li>
      <li>product, yield, after, end</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p><li> Share your labels with your group. Describe the similarities below. &#128172;</li>
  <br>
  <strong>Answer:</strong>
<br>
        Circulate around the room to hear similarities between groups. Write student ideas on the
        board to give value to contributions. Add “input,” “output,” “function,” to the lists and share with
        students that these are terms that we’ll see in future lessons to represent these concepts, and
        their answers aren’t wrong, but we need to use the same language everywhere so we all know
        what we’re talking about!
   </p>


<li>The blue “builder” in the middle of the screen is a function. Describe what a function is using the labels you've agreed on as a class. &#128172;</li>
<br>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>

  A sample student response: The function turns the input into the output. It is how the value is
  changed.
</p>


<p><li>Suppose you build this function:</li></p>

<p><li>Write a rule that describes what the function does. Compare with your group. &#128172;</li></p>
<br>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>A sample student responses may include: The function flips the image upside down (but not as a mirror does). The function rotates the image 180 degrees. The function turns the image around.</p>
</ol>


<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>The use of multiple inputs allows students to see that the function behaves consistently, and the simulation mimics building an input/output table. The use of the “see-inside” boxes equate to the use of process columns when building tables. 
  <br><br>
  Of note is the ability for students to investigate if functions are invertible. This provides an opportunity to discuss why some outputs can be pulled back through some functions but not others. If students discover this, allow them to share with the class, even though it is beyond the scope of today’s lesson. <br>
  
  <br>Allowing students to investigate the concept of a function with visual images provides them with mathematical experience that sets them up to investigate functions using numbers.</p>
