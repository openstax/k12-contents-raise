    <h4>Extending Your Thinking</h4>
    <p>Jada has a second option to earn money. She could help some neighbors with errands and computer work for $11 an hour. After reconsidering her schedule, Jada realizes that she has about 9 hours available to work one day of the weekend.</p>
    <p>Which option should she choose, sorting books at the bookstore or helping her neighbors? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</p>

    <p>Write your answer here:</p>

  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-ack">
    <p>Compare your answer: Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.</p>
    <p>You could argue either way, depending on the assumptions you make.</p>
    <p>Jada should work at the bookstore because she would earn more there. Her pay would be $109.80, and after subtracting $7.15 for the bus fare, she would still earn $102.65. She would earn $99 from the other option.</p>
    <p>Jada should help her neighbors. Working 9 hours at the bookstore would mean a few dollars more than working 9 hours helping her neighbors, but it would also mean losing some personal time because of the travel involved.</p>
