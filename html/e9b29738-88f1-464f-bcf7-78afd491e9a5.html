<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write an equation of a line parallel to a given line.</li>
<li>Write an equation of a line perpendicular to a given line.</li>
<li>Write an equation of a line parallel or perpendicular to an axis.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li> 1.13.1: Using Point-Slope Form to Write the Equation of a Line&nbsp;<ul>
<li>In this activity, you used the slope formula to find the slope of a line. Using the slope and a point, you wrote equations in point-slope form and slope-intercept form.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> 1.13.2: Writing an Equation of a Line Parallel to a Given Line<ul>
<li>In this activity, you explored parallel lines that have the same slope. You also wrote the equation of lines parallel to given lines that went through a specific point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> 1.13.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>
<li> 1.13.3: Writing an Equation of a Line Perpendicular to a Given Line<ul>
<li>In this activity, you explored perpendicular lines that have slopes that are opposite reciprocals of each other. You wrote the equations of lines that were perpendicular to a given line and went through a specific point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> 1.13.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>
<li> 1.13.4: Writing an Equation of a Line Parallel or Perpendicular to an Axis<ul>
<li>In this activity, you wrote equations of lines parallel or perpendicular to an axis through a given point, given a line in the form \(x = a\) or \(y =b\).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> 1.13.4: Self Check&nbsp;</li>
<li> 1.13.5: Drawing Parallel and Perpendicular Lines<ul>
<li>In this activity, you worked with a partner to draw parallel and perpendicular lines on a coordinate plane.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
