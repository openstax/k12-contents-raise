<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>In earlier lessons, students saw quadratic functions expressed in different ways&mdash;some written as products of two factors (for example, \(d(25-d)\) or \(16x^2\)), and some written as sums (for example, \(10+406t-16t^2\) or \(n^2+1\)). Here they see that quadratic expressions that are products of two factors can be written as sums, and that rectangular area diagrams can be used to help us write equivalent expressions. As they use diagrams to transform expressions, they notice and make use of structure.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Give students a moment of quiet time to think about how to find an equivalent expression for \((10+2)(10+a)\). Then, invite students to share their strategies, which may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> drawing a rectangle with side lengths \(10+2\) (or 12) and (\(10+a\)), partitioning it into sub-rectangles, finding the partial areas, and adding them </li>
  <li> rewriting \(10+2\) as 12, and then writing \(12(10+a)\) or \(120+12a\) </li>
  <li> multiplying each term in one factor with each term in the other factor, and then combining the partial products: \(100+10a+20+2a=120+12a\) </li>
</ul>
<p>Explain that some of the same strategies they used to expand \((10+2)(10+a)\) can be used to multiply two sums that each contains a variable, such as \((x+1)(x+3)\).</p>
<p>Consider arranging students in groups of two so that they can discuss their reasoning with a partner as they work through the activity. Also consider pausing the class after the second question. Make sure students notice how the partial areas in the diagram correspond to the expressions they produce. Noticing this structure will enable them to write equivalent expressions without drawing a diagram in the last question.</p>

  <li>Are Image 1 and Image 2 equivalent? Explain or show your reasoning.<br>

  <li>What does this tell you about an equivalent expression for \(x^2+5x+6\)?<br>

  <li>Is there a different non-zero number of 1-by-1 squares that we could use instead that would allow us to arrange the combined figures into a single large rectangle?<br>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may be unfamiliar with decomposing a rectangular diagram into sub-rectangles, especially when the side lengths represent variable expressions like \(2x+1\) and \(x+3\). They may benefit from seeing an example involving only numbers. Show that to reason about \(21 \cdot 13\), we can draw a rectangular diagram with side lengths \(20+1\) and \(10+3\), decompose the rectangle to separate the tens and ones on each side, compute the four partial areas separately, and then find the sum of those partial areas.</p>
<p>Some students may write \((x+5)^2\) as \((x^2+5^2)\). Remind them that \((x+5)^2=(x=5)(x+5)\).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students to share some of their diagrams and discuss how they generalized their work with diagrams to write equivalent expressions without diagrams. Ask questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> "To expand \((x+2)(x+6)\), which variables or numbers do we multiply first? Which do we multiply next? Is there a particular order we should follow?" (It doesn't matter, as long as each term in one factor is distributed to each term in the other factor. Drawing arrows can help us keep track of the distribution.) </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Writing equivalent expressions by distributive property." height="150" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/bc4910e555e1c7553dee24aafab87e77d5530120" width="200"></p>
<ul>
  <li> "Is \(x^2+6x+2x+12\) equivalent to \((x+2)(x+6)\)?" (Yes, but the \(6x\) and \(2x\) can also be combined to get a shorter expression: \(x^2+8x+12\).) </li>
  <li> "Look at all of the expanded expressions. How are they alike?" (They all have a term with a squared variable, a linear term (or two) with a variable, and a constant term with no variable. Each constant term is a product of the two constant terms in the factors.) </li>
  <li> "How are they different?" (Some of the squared terms have a coefficient of 2 or another number. One of the expressions shows only variables.) </li>
  <li> (Consider writing \((x+88)(x+22)=x^2+\) _____ \(x+(88 \cdot 22\)) for all to see when asking this question:) "If we expand \((x+88)(x+22)\), we know that the term with a squared variable will be \(x^2\) and the constant term will be (\(88 \cdot 22\)). How do we know what the remaining term(s) will be?" (They will be \(88x\) and \(22x\), or \((88+22)x\).)&nbsp; </li>
  <li> (Consider displaying two area diagrams for \((x+2)(x+6)\) for all to see when asking this question. Draw one with \((x+2)\) along the top edge and one with \((x+6)\) along the top edge.) "Does it matter which side of the diagram we label \(x+2\)?" (No. Both diagrams represent rectangles with the same area, and both diagrams give the same expanded expression: \(x^2+8x+12\).) </li>
</ul>
