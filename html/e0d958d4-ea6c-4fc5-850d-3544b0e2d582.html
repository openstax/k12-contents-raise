<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students study the successive bounce heights of balls, model the relationship between the number of
  bounces and the bounce heights, and use that model to answer questions about the balls&rsquo; bounciness. There are
  options for how much of the modeling cycle students undertake. In one optional activity, students collect data for the
  bounce heights of different balls, while in two activities the data are provided. In all cases, the data are
  deliberately &ldquo;messy&rdquo; to mirror data students would gather through experimentation, and students are left
  to decide what kind of model to use. Though the data are not perfectly exponential or linear, an exponential model
  fits much better.</p>
<p>Once students decide to use an exponential model, they still have to find the parameters that best fit the data while
  maintaining a reasonable level of accuracy. Some may just use the quotient of the first two bounce heights, while
  others may look more closely at all of the bounce heights. As they compare and critique the different models, students
  construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.</p>
<p>Technology isn&rsquo;t required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use
  appropriate technology to solve problems. We recommend making technology available.</p>
<p>Making internet-enabled devices available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically.
</p>
