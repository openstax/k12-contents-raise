<h4>Writing an Equation to Represent a Real-World
Problem with Percentages</h4>
<p>The steps for writing an equation to represent a
real-world scenario with percentages are the same as before. Just be sure to change the given
percent to a decimal before you use it in the equation.</p>

  <p align="center"><strong>Writing an Equation</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Step 1 - Read </strong>the problem.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 2 - Identify</strong> the variables and known values. If needed, sketch a picture of the scenario.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 3 - Write </strong>a sentence using the relationship among the values.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 4 - Translate </strong>the sentence into an equation.</p>

<p>For example, what is an equation that can represent this scenario?</p>

<p>The label on Audrey&rsquo;s yogurt said that one serving provided 12 grams of protein, which is 24% of the recommended daily amount. What is the total recommended daily amount of protein?</p>

<br>
<p>
  Here&rsquo;s how to use the steps:
  
</p><br>

<p><strong>Step 1 - Read </strong>the problem.</p>
<p>The label on Audrey's yogurt said that one serving provided 12 grams of protein, which is 24% of the recommended daily amount. What is the total recommended daily amount of protein? </p>
<p><strong>Step 2 - Identify</strong> the variables and known values.<br></p>
<p>
1 serving = 12 grams of protein<br>
1 serving is 24% of recommended daily amount
</p>
<p>Let&nbsp;\( a \) = total amount of protein (in grams).<br></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 - Write</strong> a sentence using the relationship among the values.<br></p>
<p>12 grams is 24% of the total amount</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 - Translate</strong> the sentence into an equation.<br></p>
<p>\( 12 = 0.24a \)<br></p>
