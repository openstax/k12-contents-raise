<p>In this lesson, you will study the successive bounce heights of balls, model the relationship between the number of bounces and the bounce heights, and use that model to answer questions about the balls&rsquo; bounciness. As you compare and critique the different models, you construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others. Technology isn&rsquo;t required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for you to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li> Use exponential functions to model situations that involve exponential growth or decay. </li>
  <li> Determine an appropriate model for a situation described by data. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
