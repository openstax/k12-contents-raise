<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>This lesson uses the data from the video of orange weights from the activity Orange You Glad
    We&rsquo;re Boxing Fruit. The mathematical purpose of this activity is to introduce the concept of residuals and to
    have students plot and analyze the residuals to informally assess the fit of a function. In this activity, students
    also fit a function to data, and they use the function to solve problems. Students learn that a residual is the
    difference between the actual \(y\)-value for a point and the expected \(y\)-value for the point on the linear model
    with the same associated \(x\)-value.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>The digital version of this activity includes instructions for plotting the residuals of the data. If you
  will be using graphing technology other than Desmos for this activity, you may need to prepare alternate instructions.

<p><strong>Answer: </strong>The equation of a line of best fit is \(y=0.216x+0.345\).</p>
<li>What level of accuracy makes sense for the slope and intercept values? Be prepared to show your reasoning.
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Rounding the values to the thousandths place makes sense because that would be to an accuracy of 1 gram, which is
    what the original data used.</p>
</li>
<li>What does the linear model estimate for how much the weight increases for of each additional box of oranges?
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>0.216 kg for each orange</p></li>
</li>
<li>Compare the weight of the actual box with 3 oranges in it to the estimated weight of the box with 3 oranges in it.
  Be prepared to show your reasoning.
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>The actual weight is 1.027 kg, and the estimated weight is 0.993 kg. Therefore, the actual weight is 0.034
    kg greater than the estimate.</p></li>
<li>How many oranges are in the box when the linear model estimates the weight best? Be prepared to show your
  reasoning.
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>6 oranges are in the box when the estimate is best. The difference between the estimated weight and the actual
    weight is only 0.023 kg, while the other points are farther from the line.</p></li>
<li>How many oranges are in the box when the linear model estimates the weight least well? Be prepared to show your
  reasoning.
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>7 oranges are in the box when the estimate is worst. The difference between the estimated weight and the actual
    weight is 0.095, which is the most of any of the values.</p></li>
 <p>Use the following information to answer questions 7 and 8.</p>
 <blockquote>
   <p>The difference between the actual value and the value estimated by a linear model is called the residual.</p>
   <ul>
   <li>If the actual value is greater than the estimated value, the residual is positive.&nbsp;</li>
   <li>If the actual value is less than the estimated value, the residual is negative.</li>
 </ul>
</blockquote> 
<li> For the orange weight data set, what is the residual for the line of best fit when there are 3 oranges? 

 <p><strong>Answer: </strong>The residual is \( 0.034 (1.027&minus;0.993=0.034)\).</p>
</li>
<li>On the same axes as the scatter plot, plot this residual at the point where \(x = 3\) and \(y\)
  has the value of the residual.
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>The point is (8,0.043).</p>
</li>
<li>Find the residuals for each of the other points in the scatter plot and graph them.<br><br><img

    </p>
  </li>
<li>Which point on the scatter plot has the residual closest to zero? What does this mean about the weight of the box
  with that many oranges in it?
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>6 oranges. It means the estimated weight of the box with 6 oranges in it is closest to the actual value.</p>
</li>
<li>How can you use the residuals to decide how well a line fits the data?
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>A line will result in more accurate estimates when the residuals are closer to zero.</p>
</li>

<p>Ask students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;What does it mean for the residual to be positive? Negative?&rdquo; (The residual is positive when the
    actual data value is greater than what the model estimates for that \(x\)-value and negative when the actual data
    value is less than the estimate.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;What does it mean when a residual is on or close to the horizontal axis?&rdquo; (It means that the line of
    best fit passes through or comes close to passing through that point on the graph.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Find the residual that has the farthest vertical distance from the horizontal axis. What does this mean in
    the context of the scatter plot and the line of best fit?&rdquo; (The residual that is farthest from the horizontal
    axis has the same \(x\)-coordinate as the point that is the greatest vertical distance away from the line of best
    fit in the scatter plot.)</li>

<p>The equation of a line of best fit is \(y = 6.642 + 0.03974x\), where \(x\) represents the gestational time, in days,

</p>
<p>A lion&rsquo;s gestation time is 100 days, and its longevity is 15 years. What does this line of best fit predict the
  lion&rsquo;s longevity to be?</p>
  <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>\(y=6.642+0.03974 (100)=10.6\)</p>
<p>The residual would be the actual value &ndash; estimated value or \(15-10.6 = 4.4\).</p>
<p>The residual value is 4.4.</p>
<h4>Try It: Finding Residuals</h4>
<p>In the table above, a dog has a gestation time of 61 days and a longevity of 12 years.</p>
<p>Using the same equation, \(y = 6.642 + 0.03974x\), what would the residual value be?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Substitute \(x =61\) into the equation, \(y = 6.642+0.03974(61)=9.06614\).</p>
<p>So, the residual is the (actual value &ndash; estimated value):</p>
<p>\(12-9.06614=2.93386\).</p>
