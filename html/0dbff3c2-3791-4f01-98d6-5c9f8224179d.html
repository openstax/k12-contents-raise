<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This lesson uses the data from the video of orange weights from the activity Orange You Glad We&rsquo;re Boxing Fruit. The mathematical purpose of this activity is to introduce the concept of residuals and to have students plot and analyze the residuals to informally assess the fit of a function. In this activity, students also fit a function to data, and they use the function to solve problems. Students learn that a residual is the difference between the actual \(y\)-value for a point and the expected \(y\)-value for the point on the linear model with the same associated \(x\)-value.</span></p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The digital version of this activity includes instructions for plotting the residuals of the data. If you will be using graphing technology other than Desmos for this activity, you may need to prepare alternate instructions.</p>

<p>2. What level of accuracy makes sense for the slope and intercept values? Explain your reasoning.</p>
<p>3. What does the linear model estimate for how much the weight increases for of each additional box of oranges?</p>
<p>4. Compare the weight of the actual box with 3 oranges in it to the estimated weight of the box with 3 oranges in it. Explain your reasoning.</p>
<p>5. How many oranges are in the box when the linear model estimates the weight best? Explain your reasoning.</p>
<p>6. How many oranges are in the box when the linear model estimates the weight least well? Explain your reasoning.</p>
<p>7. The difference between the actual value and the value estimated by a linear model is called the residual.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the actual value is greater than the estimated value, the residual is positive.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If the actual value is less than the estimated value, the residual is negative.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="a">
  <li>For the orange weight data set, what is the residual for the line of best fit when there are 3 oranges?&nbsp;</li>
  <li>On the same axes as the scatter plot, plot this residual at the point where \(x=3\) and \(y\) has the value of the residual.</li>
</ol>
<p>8. Find the residuals for each of the other points in the scatter plot and graph them.</p>
<p><img alt="Blank coordinate plane with grid. Horizontal axis from 0 to 11 by 1's. Vertical axis from negative 0 point 5 to 0 point 5, by 0 point 1's. &nbsp;" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/ad8dea61f8ed8a9bdf59dc47c6446b93ba30332c"><br></p>
<p>9. Which point on the scatter plot has the residual closest to zero? What does this mean about the weight of the box with that many oranges in it?</p>
<p>10. How can you use the residuals to decide how well a line fits the data?</p>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<p>1. The equation of a line of best fit is \(y=0.216x+0.345\).</p>
<p>2. Rounding the values to the thousandths place makes sense because that would be to an accuracy of 1 gram, which is what the original data used.</p>
<p>3. 0.216 kg for each orange</p>
<p><span>4. The actual weight is 1.027 kg, and the estimated weight is 0.993 kg. Therefore, the actual weight is 0.034 kg greater than the estimate.</span></p>
<p>5. 6 oranges are in the box when the estimate is best. The difference between the estimated weight and the actual weight is only 0.023 kg, while the other points are farther from the line.</p>
<p>6. 7 oranges are in the box when the estimate is worst. The difference between the estimated weight and the actual weight is 0.095, which is the most of any of the values.</p>
<p>7. The residual is \( 0.034 (1.027&minus;0.993=0.034)\).</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;<img alt="Discrete graph." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b7243f82e7125491bd9a2a9ae3f52a9c03fd5bef"></p>
<p>9. 6 oranges. It means the estimated weight of the box with 6 oranges in it is closest to the actual value.</p>
<p>10. A line will result in more accurate estimates when the residuals are closer to zero.</p>

  <p><em>Representation: Internalize Comprehension.</em> Use color coding and annotations to highlight connections between representations in a problem. For example, highlight the linear column in the table the same color as the line on the graph, and highlight the actual values on the table the same color as the corresponding points on the graph. To extend this further, the residual values can be displayed and highlighted in the same color as the residual points on the graph itself.</p>

<p><span>Anticipated Misconceptions</span></p>
<p>Students may not understand how to determine if the linear model estimates the weight of oranges well or poorly. Ask them to determine the weight that the model estimates. Then ask how close that estimate is to the actual weight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span>Activity Synthesis</span></p>
<p>Compare student answers to the question about the point that the line estimates best to the answer for the question about the residual closest to zero.</p>
<p>Show a graph of the residuals.</p>

<p>Ask students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;What does it mean for the residual to be positive? Negative?&rdquo; (The residual is positive when the actual data value is greater than what the model estimates for that \(x\)-value and negative when the actual data value is less than the estimate.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;What does it mean when a residual is on or close to the horizontal axis?&rdquo; (It means that the line of best fit passes through or comes close to passing through that point on the graph.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Find the residual that has the farthest vertical distance from the horizontal axis. What does this mean in the context of the scatter plot and the line of best fit?&rdquo; (The residual that is farthest from the horizontal axis has the same \(x\)-coordinate as the point that is the greatest vertical distance away from the line of best fit in the scatter plot.)</li>

<div>
  <p><em>Conversing, Writing: MLR2 Collect and Display. </em>Before a whole-class discussion in the activity synthesis, invite students to discuss their understanding of residuals with a partner. Listen for and collect vocabulary and phrases students use to describe how to calculate residuals, what positive residual and negative residual mean, and what happens when the residual is 0. Display words and phrases, such as &ldquo;difference between actual data and estimates,&rdquo; &ldquo;estimate is greater/less than actual data,&rdquo; and &ldquo;linear estimate is close to actual data&rdquo; for all to see, and then encourage students to use this language in their written responses. This will help students read and use mathematical language during whole-group discussions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The equation of a line of best fit is \(y = 6.642 + 0.03974x\), where \(x\) represents the gestational time, in days, and \(y\) represents longevity, in years.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="310" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/684400b4f64ffc962153b57e6482c56cd503a7fa" width="350"><br></p>
<p>A lion&rsquo;s gestation time is 100 days, and its longevity is 15 years. What does this line of best fit predict the lion&rsquo;s longevity to be?</p>
<p>\(y=6.642+0.03974 (100)=10.6\)</p>
<p>The residual would be the actual value &ndash; estimated value or \(15-10.6 = 4.4\).</p>
<p>The residual value is 4.4.</p>
<h4>Try It: Finding Residuals</h4>
<p>In the table above, a dog has a gestation time of 61 days and a longevity of 12 years.</p>
<p>Using the same equation, \(y = 6.642 + 0.03974x\), what would the residual value be?</p>
<p>Write down your answer. Then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to check your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to find the residual:</p>
<p>Substitute \(x =61\) into the equation, \(y = 6.642+0.03974(61)=9.06614\).</p>
<p>So, the residual is the (actual value &ndash; estimated value):</p>
<p>\(12-9.06614=2.93386\).</p>
