<h4>Activity </h4>
<p>Every year after a new car is purchased, it loses \(\frac13\) of its value. Another way to think about this is that the car retains \(\frac23\) of its value each year. Let&rsquo;s say that a new car&rsquo;s value is $18,000.</p>

<p>Your answers may vary, but here is an example:</p>
<p> Disagree. Sample explanation: If the car loses a third of its value each year, then after one year its value will be \(\frac23\) of $18,000 or $12,000. After two years its value will be \(\frac23\) of $12,000 or $8,000. And after three years its value will be \(\frac23\) of $8,000 or about $5,333. The buyer might have thought that &ldquo;losing a third of its value each year&rdquo; meant losing $6,000 each year, so after 3 years the car would be worthless (because \(3 \cdot 6,000=18,000\)). He may not realize that after one year, the value of the car is no longer $18,000. </p>

<h4>Extending Your Thinking</h4>
<p>Start with an equilateral triangle with area 1 square unit, divide it into 4 congruent pieces as in the figure, and remove the middle one. Then, repeat this process with each of the remaining pieces. Repeat this process over and over for the remaining pieces. The figure shows the first two steps of this construction.</p>
<p><img alt="3 figures showing construction of a pattern" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/2f9eaa9799b69a412f7d7d0b5f223000aa7628c8"></p>
<p>What fraction of the area is removed each time? How much area is removed after the nth step? Use a calculator to find out how much area remains in the triangle after 50 such steps have been taken.</p>
</div>
<div class="os-raise-ib-input-prompt">
<p>Enter your answer here:</p>

<div class="os-raise-ib-input-ack">
<p>Compare your answer:</p>
<p>Each step, \(\frac14\) of the remaining area is removed, since taking away \(\frac14\) from each smaller triangle results in taking \(\frac14\) of the total remaining area. That means that each step, the remaining area is multiplied by \(\frac34\) since \(1&minus;\frac{1}{4} =\frac{3}{4}\). So after \(n\) steps, the remaining area is simply \((\frac{3}{4})^n\). After 50 steps, this leaves an area of only about 0.000000566321656 square units, so there&rsquo;s almost nothing left!</p>
<p>If you can imagine doing this process forever, the resulting shape is called the Sierpinski triangle.</p>
