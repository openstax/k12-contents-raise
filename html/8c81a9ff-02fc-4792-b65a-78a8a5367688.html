<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>What information does a correlation coefficient tell you about the data in a scatter plot?  
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.</p>
<p>The sign of the correlation coefficient matches the sign of the slope for the best fit line. The closer the correlation coefficient value is to 0, the weaker the linear relationship. The closer the correlation coefficient is to 1 or –1, the stronger the linear relationship.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li>Which value best estimates the value for the correlation coefficient of the scatter plot: –1, –0.8, –0.2, 0.2, 0.8, or 1? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</li>
</ol>

<p> <strong>Answer: </strong>
    Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. </p>
<p>–0.8, since the points form a fairly strong linear pattern that is decreasing to the right</p>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
