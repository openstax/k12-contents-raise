<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>Student Activity<br></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>What information does a correlation coefficient tell you about the data in a scatter plot?</li>
  <li>Which value best estimates the value for the correlation coefficient of the scatter plot: &ndash;1, &ndash;0.8, &ndash;0.2, 0.2, 0.8, or 1? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Student Response</h4>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>The sign of the correlation coefficient matches the sign of the slope for the best fit line. The closer the correlation coefficient value is to 0, the worse the best fit line fits the data. The closer the correlation coefficient is to 1 or &ndash;1, the better the best fit line fits the data.</li>
  <li>&ndash;0.8, since the data appears to be decreasing and a line is an okay fit for the data, but it is not perfect.</li>
</ol>
<p>Response to Student Thinking<br></p>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.<br></p>
