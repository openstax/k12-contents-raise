<h4>Real-World Applications</h4>
<p>In this unit, students use scatter plots and lines of best fit to visualize numerical data in two variables. A scatter plot is a graph that can be used to show the actual data. The line of best fit is a line that shows the relationship between the points in the scatter plot.</p>
<p>The table shows how much money, in dollars, the coach will make based on how many athletes sign up for one-on-one training.</p>

<p>The graph shows the scatter plot of the data from the table, along with the linear model, \(y=200+25x\), that represents the data.<br>

<p>The actual amount, in dollars, the coach will make after signing up 15 athletes is $600, as determined from the table and as estimated from the scatter plot.</p>
<p>The estimated amount, in dollars, the coach will make after signing up 15 athletes can be determined by substituting 15 for \(x\) in the equation: \(y=200+25(15)\), \(y=200+375, y=$575\).</p>
<p>$700 is the actual amount and the estimated amount the coach will make after signing up 20 athletes, according to the table and the equation: \(700=200+25x\), \(500=25x, x=20\).</p>
<p>The slope of the line is 25 and means that for each athlete who signs up, the amount in dollars increases by $25.</p>
<p>The \(y\)-intercept is 200 and means that if zero athletes sign up, the coach will make $200. This doesn&rsquo;t really make sense in this case because if no athletes sign up for one-on-one training, the coach will not make any money.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a task for you to try with your student:</strong></p>
<p>With your student, examine the data collected showing the number of sales of eyeglasses based on the price in dollars.</p>
<p>Here are a graph and a table showing the number of sales of eyeglasses based on the price in dollars. The model, represented by \(y=1,000-16x\), is graphed with a scatter plot. Use the graph, table, and equation to answer the questions.</p>

  <li>What is the \(y\)-intercept of the linear model? What does this mean in this situation? Does this make sense?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>
</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>600 from the equation: \(y=1,000-16(25)\), \(y=600\); or 600 from the linear model graph</li>
  <li>$40.63; from the equation: \(350=1,000-16x\), \(x=40.625\); or approximately $40 from the linear model graph
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
      <li>200 from the equation: \(y=1,000-16(50)\), \(x=200\); or approximately 200 from the linear model graph</li>
      <li>175 from the table; or approximately 175 from the scatter plot graph</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>\(-16\). This means that, for every price increase of one dollar for eyeglasses, the number of sales is expected to decrease by about 16.</li>
  <li>1,000. This means that eyeglasses that are free would have sales of 1,000. Compare your answer: This doesn&rsquo;t seem to make sense because something that is free is not likely to follow the pattern of items with a cost.</li>

<h4>Video Lesson Summaries</h4>
<br>
<p>Here are the video lesson summaries for Unit 3: Two-Variable Statistics. Each video highlights key concepts and vocabulary that students learn across one or more lessons in the unit. The content of these video lesson summaries is based on the written Lesson Summaries found at the end of lessons in the curriculum. The goal of these videos is to support students in reviewing and checking their understanding of important concepts and vocabulary. Here are some possible ways families can use these videos:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keep informed on concepts and vocabulary students are learning about in class.</li>
  <li>Watch with their students and pause at key points to predict what comes next or think up other examples of vocabulary terms.</li>
  <li>Consider following the Connecting to Other Units links to review the math concepts that led up to this unit or to preview where the concepts in this unit lead to in future units.</li>
