<p>Refer back to the population graphs for Baltimore and Cleveland from 1900 to 2010, which students saw in the warm-up. Display the graphs for all to see.</p>
<p><img alt="Two functions. year and population." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/62900a61e10d021a7053a7db0482074a387ba557"></p>
<p>Present students with the following statements, one at a time, about the populations of the two cities. Tell students that their job is to explain how they could tell from the graphs that each statement is true, and to translate each verbal description into a statement with the same meaning but written in function notation.</p>
<p>Consider using a three-column graphic organizer to organize students&rsquo; responses.</p>
