<p>Refer back to the population graphs for Baltimore and Cleveland from 1900 to 2010, which students saw in the warm up. Display the graphs for all to see.</p>
<p><img alt="Line graph showing population trends from 1900 to 2010 for Baltimore (solid blue line) and Cleveland (dashed red line). Both cities peak in mid-1900s, then decline, with Baltimore maintaining a higher population throughout." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/62900a61e10d021a7053a7db0482074a387ba557"/></p>
<p>Present students with the following statements, one at a time, about the populations of the two cities. Tell students that their job is to explain how they could tell from the graphs that each statement is true, and to translate each verbal description into a statement with the same meaning but written in function notation.</p>
<p>Consider using a three-column graphic organizer to organize students’ responses.</p>
