<p>In this lesson, you will investigate different ways to find the solution set to an inequality&mdash;by reasoning about the quantities and relationships in context; by guessing some values, substituting them into the inequality, and checking them to see if you make the inequality true; and by first solving a related equation in one variable. </p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Graph the solution to an inequality in one variable.</li>
  <li>Solve one-variable inequalities.</li>
  <li>Interpret the solutions to one-variable inequalities in terms of the situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities </strong>that will help you reach those goals:</p>
