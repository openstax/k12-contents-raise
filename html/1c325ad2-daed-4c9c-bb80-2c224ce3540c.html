<h4>The Meaning of Quadratic Characteristics</h4>
<p>The height in feet of an object \(t\) seconds after being dropped is graphed below: \(h(t)=576-16t^2\).</p>
<p><img alt="&lt;p&gt;Graph of the quadratic function h(t)=576 - 16t^2 on a coordinate plane, origin O. Horizontal axis scale negative 8 to 8 by 4&rsquo;s, labeled &ldquo;time (seconds)&rdquo;. Vertical axis scale 0 to 800 by 200&rsquo;s, labeled &ldquo;height (feet)&rdquo;. Some of the points of this function are (negative 6 comma 0), (negative 4 comma 320) and (negative 2 comma 512) to a maximum at (0 comma 576) then decreasing through (2 comma 512), (4 comma 320) and (6 comma 0).&lt;/p&gt;" height="287" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/22710f1e7cfc5f8d5c2b14fc760a640611ae9322" width="262"></p>
<p>Find the domain of the function.</p>
<ul>
  <li> The <strong><span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-store="glossary-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0"> domain</span></strong> is the \(t\) values, \(0 \leq t \leq 6\) or only numbers from \(0\) up through \(6\). Negative values of time don&rsquo;t make sense here, so the part of the graph to the left side of the vertical axis has no meaning. The object hits the ground \(6\) seconds after being dropped, so values greater than \(6\) are not meaningful. </li>
</ul>

<p>Find the range of the function.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <strong><span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-store="glossary-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0"> range</span></strong> of the height of the function is from the initial height down to the ground. In this case, since the object is being dropped from a height of 576 feet and falls to the ground, the range of the function is [0, 576]. This means that the object's height will be between 0 feet (when it hits the ground) and 576 feet (when it is initially dropped).</li>
</ul>
<p>Find the vertex and describe its meaning.</p>
<ul>
  <li> The <strong><span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-store="glossary-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0"> vertex (of a graph)</span></strong> is the peak of the parabola, or the maximum, at the point \((0,576)\). It tells us the time when the height is the greatest. </li>
</ul>
<p>Find the zeros and describe their meaning.</p>
<ul>
  <li> The <strong><span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-store="glossary-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0"> zero of the function</span></strong> is \(6\). It tells us that the height of the object is \(0\) feet at \(6\) seconds after being dropped, or the time when the object hits the ground. </li>
</ul>
