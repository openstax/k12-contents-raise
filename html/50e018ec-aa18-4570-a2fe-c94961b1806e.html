<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>The purpose of this activity is to further develop the idea that we can solve an inequality by first solving a related equation. Previously, students reasoned about the solutions to an inequality in context. Here, they transition to solving an inequality without a context.</p>
<p>This activity offers another opportunity to point out the trouble with isolating the variable directly on the inequality statement, or with assuming that the solution set can be expressed using the same symbol as in the original inequality. (For example, if in the final step of solving students go from \( -24x&le;-48 \) to \(x&le;2\), they would end up with the wrong solution set.)</p>

<h3>Activity Synthesis&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Display a blank number line for all to see. Ask students to share some values on the number line that are and are not solutions. Use different colors or different symbols to mark on the number line the solutions and non-solutions.</p>
<p><span>Emphasize that if we solve an inequality by using a related equation, it is important to make sure that the solution to the equation is correct because that solution gives us a boundary from which we could check the solutions to the inequality. If the boundary value is off, we may not be able to correctly find the solution set to the inequality.</p>

<h3>2.8.5: Additional Resources</h3>
<p><strong><em>The following content is available to students who would like more support based on their experience with the self check. Students will not automatically have access to this content, so you may wish to share it with those who could benefit from it.&nbsp;</em></strong><br></p>
<h3><span><span>Comparing Equality and Inequality</h3>
<p>We can use related equations to help find solutions to inequalities.</p>
<p><strong>Example&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Look at the inequality&nbsp;</p>
<p>\( -\frac{3x+7}4&lt;-3x+5\)</p>
<p>We can solve its related equation \(-\frac{3x+7}4=-3x+5\).</p>
<p>After solving, we know that \( x = 3 \).</p>
<p>Does 3 satisfy the inequality?</p>
<p>\( -\frac{3x+7}4&lt;-3x+5\)<br><br>\(-\frac{3(3)+7}4\;\begin{array}{l}?\\&lt;\end{array}-3(3)+5\)<br><br>\(-4\) \(\not&lt;\) \(-4\)</p>
     
<p>So, 3 is not a solution.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try a number bigger than 3, such as 5.</p>
<p>\( -\frac{3x+7}4&lt;-3x+5\)<br><br>\(-\frac{3(5)+7}4\;\begin{array}{l}?\\&lt;\end{array}-3(5)+5\)<br><br>\(-\frac{11}2\)&nbsp;\(\not&lt;\) \(-10\)</p>
<p>So, 5 is not a solution</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try a number smaller than 3, such as 0.</p>
<p>\( -\frac{3x+7}4&lt;-3x+5\)<br><br>\(-\frac{3(0)+7}4\;\begin{array}{l}?\\&lt;\end{array}-3(0)+5\)<br><br>\(-\frac74&lt;5\)</p>
  

<p>So, 0 is a solution.</p>
<p>This means that the solution set is \( x &lt; 3 \).</p>
<h3>Try It: Comparing Equality and Inequality</h3>
<p>Use the related equation to \(\frac{5x-3}2\;&lt;\;3x\;-\;4\) to find the solution set to the inequality.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li><span>What is the related equation?</li>
  <li><span>What is the solution to the related equation?</li>
  <li><span>What values did you test on the inequality?</li>
  <li><span>What is the solution set to the inequality?</li>
</ol>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>Here is how to find the solution set:<br></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li>\( \frac{5x-3}{2} =3x-4 \)</li>
    <li>\( x = 5 \)</li>
    <li>Since 5 is the solution to the related equation, I tested it. I also tested 4 and 6 since they represent a value less than and greater than 5.</li>
    <li>\( x &gt; 5 \)</li>
</ol>
