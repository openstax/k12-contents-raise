<h3>Activity (10 minutes)</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The purpose of this activity is to further develop the idea that we can solve an inequality by first solving a related equation. Previously, students reasoned about the solutions to an inequality in context. Here, they transition to solving an inequality without a context.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This activity offers another opportunity to point out the trouble with isolating the variable directly on the inequality statement, or with assuming that the solution set can be expressed using the same symbol as in the original inequality. (For example, if in the final step of solving students go from \( -24x&le;-48 \) to \(x&le;2\), they would end up with the wrong solution set.)</p>

        <p>Here is a different type of inequality: \(x^2\leq4\).</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Is 1 a solution to the inequality? Is 3 a solution? How about \(-3\)?</li>
          <li>Describe all solutions to this inequality. (If you like, you can graph the solutions on a number line.)</li>
          <li>Describe all solutions to the inequality \(x^2\geq9\).&nbsp;Test several numbers to make sure your answer is correct.</li>
        </ol>


        <h3>Extension Student Response</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>yes, no, no.</li>
          <li>\( -2 &le; x &le; 2 \)</li>
          <li>\( x &le;-3 \) or \( x &ge; 3 \)</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Activity Synthesis&nbsp;</h3>
        <p>Display a blank number line for all to see. Ask students to share some values on the number line that are and are not solutions. Use different colors or different symbols to mark on the number line the solutions and non-solutions.</p>
        <p><span>Emphasize that if we solve an inequality by using a related equation, it is important to make sure that the solution to the equation is correct because that solution gives us a boundary from which we could check the solutions to the inequality. If the boundary value is off, we may not be able to correctly find the solution set to the inequality.</span></p>
