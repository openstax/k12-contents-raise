<p>When the quadratic paths of pumpkins in the Punkin Chunkin are graphed, their intercepts and other key points describe important parts of the path such as where the pumpkin was launched from and how far it travels.</p>
<p>Standard and factored forms can not only help identify the intercepts, but a third form, the vertex form, helps to identify the vertex. The intercepts and vertex help to identify key characteristics such as maximum height and distance traveled before landing.</p>
<p>This section includes seven lessons:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Graphing From the Factored Form </li>
  <li> Graphing the Standard Form (Part I) </li>
  <li> Graphing the Standard Form (Part II) </li>
  <li> Graphs the Represent Situation </li>
  <li> Vertex Form </li>
  <li> Graphing From the Vertex Form </li>
  <li> Changing the Vertex </li>
</ul>
