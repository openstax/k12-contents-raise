<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Explain how the numbers and signs in a quadratic expression in factored form relate to the numbers and signs in an equivalent expression in standard form. </li>
  <li> Write an equivalent expression in factored form, given a quadratic expression in standard form with a negative constant term. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> 8.7.1: Understanding Sums and Products of Integers </li>
  <ul class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li> In this activity, you identified the factors of various numbers and studied their sums. This built a foundation for understanding how to find the factored forms of different quadratic expressions. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 8.7.2: Interpreting Negative Constant Terms When Factoring Quadratic Expressions </li>
  <ul class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li> In this activity, you learned how to find the factored form of a quadratic expression that has a negative constant term. </li>
    <li> 8.7.2: Self Check </li>
    <li> 8.7.2: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 8.7.3: Analyzing Factors of 100 and &ndash;100 </li>
  <ul class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li> In this activity, you continued exploring how to find the factored form of a quadratic expression with a negative constant term. You learned to distinguish the signs of the factors based on the middle, or linear, term in the quadratic expression. </li>
    <li> 8.7.3: Self Check </li>
    <li> 8.7.3: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 8.7.4: Finding the Missing Terms </li>
  <ul class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li> In this activity, you combined all of the skills learned in the lesson to identify missing signs in conversions from quadratic expressions in standard form to factored form. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
