<h4><span>Warm Up (5 minutes)</span><br/></h4>
<p>This warm up prompts students to carefully analyze and compare graphs that represent linear equations and inequalities. Making comparisons prompts students to think about the solutions to the equations, inequalities, or systems that are being represented.<br/></p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2 – 4. Display the graphs for all to see. Ask students to indicate when they have noticed one that does not belong and can explain why. Give students 1 minute of quiet time to think individually and then time to share their thinking with their small group. In their small groups, tell each student to share their reasoning why a particular item does not belong and together find at least one reason each item doesn’t belong.<br/></p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Compare each of the following graphs, then list a reason for each graph why it would not belong with the other three.</p>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p>Your answers may vary, but here are some samples.</p>
<ul>
<li> Graph A is the only set of graphs that represents a system of equations. It is the only system with exactly one solution.</li>
<li>Graph B is the only set of graphs that represents a system of inequalities with no solutions.</li>
<li>Graph C is the only set of graphs in which the boundaries are horizontal and vertical lines. It is the only one representing a system with an infinite number of solutions.</li>
<li>Graph D is the only graph that does not represent a system. It only represents one inequality.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p><span>Ask each group to share one reason why a particular item does not belong. Record and display the responses for all to see. After each response, ask the class if they agree or disagree. Since there is no single correct answer to the question of which one does not belong, attend to students’ explanations and ensure the reasons given are correct.</span><br/></p>
<p>During the discussion, ask students to explain the meaning of any terminology they use, such as “infinitely many solutions” or “boundary line.” Also, press students on unsubstantiated claims.</p>
