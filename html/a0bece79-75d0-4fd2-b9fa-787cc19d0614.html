<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In earlier lessons, students interpreted and wrote statements in function notation to represent specific input-output
  pairs of a function (such as \(p(2.5)=18\)) or relationships between specific pairs (such as \(W(10)=W(12)\)).</p>
<p>In this lesson, students learn that function notation can also be used to describe the rule of a function or how a
  function behaves generally, at any value of input. For instance, they see that if the output of a function \(f\) can
  be found by multiplying the input by 3 and then subtracting 10 from the result, we can write \(f(x)=3x-10\) to
  represent this rule. We can also use this rule (either the verbal description or the equation) to find the output for
  any input. In some cases, the rule can also be used to find the input when we know the output.</p>
<p>Students continue to decontextualize given situations into symbolic representations and to contextualize the latter
  to solve problems. To connect different representations of functions defined by rules, they look for and make use of
  structure.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create tables and graphs to represent a function given statements in function notation.</li>
  <li>Interpret rules of functions that are expressed using function notation.</li>
  <li>Use function notation to write equations that represent rules of functions.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Explain rules of functions when they are written in function notation and create tables and graphs to represent
    the functions.</li>
  <li>Write equations that represent the rules of functions.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are
  only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.
  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    ELPS 1(F) use accessible language and learn new and essential language in the process
  </li>
  <li>
    ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and
    reinforce concept and language attainment
  </li>
  <li>
    ELPS 3(F) ask and give information ranging from using a very limited bank of high-frequency, high-need, concrete
    vocabulary, including key words and expressions needed for basic communication in academic and social contexts, to
    using abstract and content-based vocabulary during extended speaking assignments
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Support for Building Character</h4>
<p>Throughout this unit, find ways to encourage and support students to work on cultivating their
  <strong>creativity</strong>.</p>
