<h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>
<p>By now, students are aware that a relationship between two or more quantities can be expressed in multiple ways by
  writing equivalent equations. In this lesson, they see that depending on the quantity in which we are interested, one
  form of equation might be more useful than others. Pinning down a quantity of interest may mean manipulating or
  rearranging a given equation. The rearrangement may involve solving for a variable&mdash;isolating it and defining it
  in terms of the other variables. Students notice that solving for a variable can be an efficient way to solve problems
  and to avoid cumbersome calculations.</p>
<p>Throughout the lesson, students reason repeatedly and look for regularity as they manipulate equations and solve for
  a variable (A1.1B and A1.1F).</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:<br></p>
<ul>
  <li>Comprehend that &ldquo;to solve for a variable&rdquo; is to rearrange an equation to isolate a variable of
    interest.</li>
  <li>Rearrange multi-variable equations to highlight a particular quantity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Solve for a particular variable, given an equation</li>
  <li>Determine the more useful form of an equation.</li>
  <li>Explain the phrase &ldquo;to solve for a variable.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners
</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are
  only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.
  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A1(B) monitor oral and written language production and employ self-corrective techniques or other resources
  </li>
  <li>A1(F) use accessible language and learn new and essential language in the process
  </li>
  <li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and
    reinforce concept and language attainment
  </li>
  <li>A3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions
  </li>
  <li>A4(F) use visual and contextual support and support from peers and teachers to read grade-appropriate content area
    text, enhance and confirm understanding, and develop vocabulary, grasp of language structures, and background
    knowledge needed to comprehend increasingly challenging language
  </li>
</ul>
