      <h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>By now, students are aware that a relationship between two or more quantities can be expressed in multiple ways by writing equivalent equations. In this lesson, they see that depending on the quantity in which we are interested, one form of equation might be more useful than others. Pinning down a quantity of interest may mean manipulating or rearranging a given equation. The rearrangement may involve solving for a variable&mdash;isolating it and defining it in terms of the other variables. Students notice that solving for a variable can be an efficient way to solve problems and to avoid cumbersome calculations.</p>
        <p>Throughout the lesson, students reason repeatedly and look for regularity as they manipulate equations and solve for a variable (MP8).</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h3>
      <p><span>Students will be able to:</span><br></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Comprehend that &ldquo;to solve for a variable&rdquo; is to rearrange an equation to isolate a variable of interest.</li>
        <li>Rearrange multi-variable equations to highlight a particular quantity.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <h3>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Solve for a particular variable, given an equation</li>
        <li>Determine the more useful form of an equation.</li>
        <li>Explain the phrase &ldquo;to solve for a variable.&rdquo;</li>
      </ul>
