<h3>Warm Up (10 minutes)</h3>
<p>The goal of this warm up is to motivate the need for a notation that can be used to communicate about functions.</p>
<p>Students analyze three graphs from an earlier lesson, interpret various points on the graphs, and use their analyses to answer questions about the situations. This work requires students to make careful connections between points on the graphs, pairs of input and output values, and verbal descriptions of the functions. Students find that, unless each feature and the function being referenced are clearly articulated, which could be tedious to do, what they wish to communicate about the functions may be ambiguous or unclear.</p>
<p>Consider the statment, "The dog was 2 feet away from the post after 80 seconds." Ask students if this statement was applicable to all three days or only specific days. Then, ask them if the question about the farthest distance the dog reached was applicable to all three days or only specific days. Even though the statement and question can be asked or applied to all three days, the answer is different based on the dog's movements. Thus, the dog is only 2 feet away at 80 seconds on Day 3. And, the farthest the dog ever reached was 5 feet away, but that happened at different times for each day (around 50 seconds for Day 1; around 35 seconds for Day 2; around 3 seconds for Day 3). </p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2 to discuss and answer questions.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here are the graphs of some situations you saw before. Each graph represents the distance of a dog from a post as a function of time since the dog owner left to purchase something from a store. Distance is measured in feet, and time is measured in seconds. Use the given graphs to answer questions about each of the three days. 
</p>
<p>Day 1</p>
<p><img alt="A line graph showing distance from a post in feet versus time in seconds. The curve rises and dips with a peak around 50 seconds, dips, then rises again. Two points are marked on the curve at about 0 and 60 seconds." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/34491baf9eedf82892115acb6b6df9202640cb5e"/></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>How far away was the dog from the post 60 seconds after the owner left?</li>
<strong>Answer:</strong> 4 feet
<li>How far away was the dog from the post when the owner left? </li>
<strong>Answer:</strong> 1.5 feet
<li>How far away was the dog from the post 160 seconds after the owner left? </li>
<strong>Answer:</strong> about 3.7 feet
<li>How many seconds passed before the dog reached the farthest point it could reach from the post?</li>
<strong>Answer:</strong> about 50 seconds

</ol>
<p>Day 2</p>
<p><img alt="A line graph showing distance from post in feet versus time in seconds. The line rises, dips, peaks, and then levels off at 4 feet from 60 seconds onward. Two points are marked at roughly (0, 1.5) and (60, 4)." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/7c49de875e83020f2c00535b3be64810d45df3bf"/><br/>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
<li>Consider the statement, “The dog was 2 feet away from the post after 80 seconds.” Do you agree with the statement?</li>
<strong>Answer:</strong> No, this statement is incorrect. After 80 seconds, the dog is 4 feet away from the post.
  <li>How far away was the dog from the post when the owner left?</li>
<strong>Answer:</strong> 1.5 feet
  <li>The owner returned 160 seconds after he left. How far away was the dog from the post at this time?</li>
<strong>Answer:</strong> 4 feet
  <li>How many seconds passed before the dog reached the farthest point it could reach from the post?</li>
<strong>Answer:</strong> about 34 seconds

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their response to the first set of questions.</p>
<p>To help illustrate that it could be tedious to refer to a specific part of a function fully and precisely, ask each question completely for each of the three days. (For instance, “How far away was the dog from the post 60 seconds after the owner left on Day 1? How far away was the dog from the post 60 seconds after the owner left on Day 2?”) If students offer a numerical value (for instance, “1.5 feet”) without stating what question it answers or to what quantity it corresponds, ask them to clarify.</p>
<p>Remind students about the statements of where the dog was located after 80 seconds and when the dog was farthest away from the post. Remind students that the answers to questions about these situations depends on the day. When the day (or the function) is not specified, it is unclear what information is sought. </p>
<p>Explain that sometimes we need to be pretty specific when talking about functions. But to be specific could require many words and become burdensome. Tell students that they will learn about a way to describe functions clearly and succinctly.</p>
