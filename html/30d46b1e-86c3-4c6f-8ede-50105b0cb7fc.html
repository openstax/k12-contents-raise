<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Clare volunteers at a local library during the summer. Her work includes putting labels on 750 books.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>How many minutes will she need to finish labeling all books if she takes no breaks and labels <strong>10 books a minute?
  </strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 75 minutes</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>How many minutes will she need to finish labeling all books if she takes no breaks and labels <strong>15 books a minute?</strong> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 50 minutes</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Suppose Clare labels the books at a constant speed of \(s\) books per minute. Write an equation that represents
    the relationship between her labeling speed and the number of minutes it would take her to finish labeling.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( s * m=750 \) or \( m= \frac{750}{s} \), where \(m\) is the number of minutes and \(s\) is
  the speed in books per minute.</p>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h4>More Chances</h4>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to
  slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance
  for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current
  understanding.</p>
