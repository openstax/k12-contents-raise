<h2>Cool-Down (5 minutes)</h2>
</div>
<h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>
<div>
<p>Clare volunteers at a local library during the summer. Her work includes putting labels on 750 books.</p>
<p>1. How many minutes will she need to finish labeling all books if she takes no breaks and labels:<br>a. 10 books a minute?<br>b. 15 books a minute?<br></p>
<p>2. Suppose Clare labels the books at a constant speed of \(s\) books per minute. Write an equation that represents the relationship between her labeling speed and the number of minutes it would take her to finish labeling.</p>
</div>
<h3>Student Response</h3>
<p>1. Answers:<br>a. 75 minutes<br>b. 50 minutes<span><br></span></p>
<p><span>2. \( s * m=750 \) or \( m= \frac{750}{s} \), where \(m\) is the number of minutes and \(s\) is the speed in books per minute.</span></p>

<h4>More Chances</h4>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
