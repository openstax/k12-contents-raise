<h4>Writing Linear Equations from Tables</h4>
<p>When writing linear equations from tables, it is important to identify the slope and the \(y\)-intercepts from the table.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Given the table, write an equation in slope-intercept form.</p>
<table class="os-raise-midsizetable">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">0</th>
      <th scope="col">1</th>
      <th scope="col">2</th>
      <th scope="col">3</th>
      <th scope="col">4</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>12</td>
      <td>16</td>
      <td>20</td>
      <td>24</td>
      <td>28</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Identify the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p>The \(y\)-intercept is the starting value, when \(x=0\).<br>
  Looking at the table, when \(x = 0\), the \(y\)-value is 12, so this is the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Identify the slope.</p>
<p>Slope is the change in \(y\) over the change in \(x\).<br>
  The \(y\)-values change by 4 each time. The \(x\)-values change by 1 each time.</p>
<p>The slope is \(\frac41\) or 4.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Write the equation in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p>Slope intercept form is \(y = mx +b\), where \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the \(y\)-intercept.<br>
  Substitute the values, \(y = 4x +12\).</p>

    <p>Here is how to write the equation in slope-intercept form:</p>
    <p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Identify the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
    <p>The \(y\)-intercept is the starting value, when \(x=0\).<br>
      Looking at the table, when \(x = 0\), the \(y\)-value is 6, so this is the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Identify the slope.</p>
    <p>Slope is the change in \(y\) over the change in \(x\).<br>
      The \(y\)-values change by 5 each time. The \(x\)-values change by 1 each time.<br>
      The slope is \(\frac51\) or 5.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Write the equation in slope-intercept form.</p>
    <p>Slope intercept form is \(y = mx +b\), where \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the \(y\)-intercept.<br>
      Substitute the values, \(y = 5x +6\).</p>
