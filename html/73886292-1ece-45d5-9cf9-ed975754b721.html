<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students continue to examine situations characterized by exponential decay. The emphasis here is on analyzing graphs representing such situations. Students work across representations: from graphs to equations and from verbal descriptions to graphs. In addition to interpreting mathematical representations in context, students also think carefully about how the numbers used in place of \(a\) and \(b\) in an expression of the form \(a \cdot b^x\) influence the graph of the equation \(y=a \cdot b^x\) A1(F).</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Determine whether situations are characterized by exponential growth or by exponential decay given descriptions and graphs. </li>
  <li> Use graphs to compare and contrast situations that involve exponential decay. </li>
  <li> Use information from a graph to write an equation that represents exponential decay. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>

  <h4>Support for English Language Learners </h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines. </p>
<ul>
  <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(D) speak using grade-level content area vocabulary in context to internalize new English words and build academic language proficiency </li>
  <li>ELPS 3(F) ask and give information ranging from using a very limited bank of high-frequency, high-need, concrete vocabulary, including key words and expressions needed for basic communication in academic and social contexts, to using abstract and content-based vocabulary during extended speaking assignments </li>
</ul>
