<h4>Lesson Narrative&nbsp;</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students continue to examine situations characterized by exponential decay. The emphasis here is on analyzing graphs representing such situations. Students work across representations: from graphs to equations and from verbal descriptions to graphs. In addition to interpreting mathematical representations in context, students also think carefully about how the numbers used in place of \(a\) and \(b\) in an expression of the form \(a \cdot b^x\) influence the graph of the equation \(y=a \cdot b^x\) (MP7).</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Determine whether situations are characterized by exponential growth or by exponential decay given descriptions and graphs. </li>
  <li> Use graphs to compare and contrast situations that involve exponential decay. </li>
  <li> Use information from a graph to write an equation that represents exponential decay. </li>
</ul>
