<h4>Activity (30 minutes)</h4>
<p>The purpose of this activity is to define the word &ldquo;sequence.&rdquo; In this activity, students experiment with
  solving the Tower of Hanoi puzzle for different numbers of starting discs. They look for a pattern in the sequence
  generated by listing the number of moves needed to solve the puzzle for different numbers of discs and then describe
  the pattern informally. The other purpose of this activity is to establish that students are expected to try things
  out, look for patterns, explain their thinking, justify their responses, and listen respectfully to their classmates.
</p>
<p>This activity works best when each group has access to manipulatives or devices that can run the GeoGebra applet
  because students will benefit from seeing the relationship in a dynamic way. If students don&rsquo;t have individual
  access, projecting the applet during the launch would be helpful.</p>
<p>Monitor for students writing clear explanations for Jada&rsquo;s reasoning and for the number of moves needed for 5
  discs to share during the discussion.</p>
<p>Students should manipulate either physical or digital objects to experiment with the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. For
  physical, each group could use a quarter, nickel, penny, and dime, and a piece of paper with 3 circles drawn on it.
  For students using the digital version of the materials, acquire devices that can run the digital applet. It is ideal
  if each student has their own device.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Set up either a physical puzzle with 2 discs or the digital version with 2 discs and
  display a table for all to see that looks like this throughout the discussion:</p>
<table class="os-raise-horizontaltable">

</table>
<br>
<p>Ask students to read the two rules of the puzzle. Next, invite students to name what moves are possible (move the top
  small disc to the middle peg) and which are not allowed (move both discs at once to the middle peg). Complete the
  puzzle for two discs, asking students to suggest moves to complete the puzzle in the smallest number of moves (3).
  Fill in the table for the number of moves needed for 2 discs. Tell students that now it is their turn to figure out
  the number of moves needed for different numbers of discs. Distribute objects with which to experiment with the
  puzzle. Alternatively, help students access the digital applet.</p>
<p>Ask students to read the rules to the puzzle and then give them time to solve the puzzle with 2 discs. Before
  students start working, remind them they need to keep track of the number of moves needed for each new number of
  discs, and that they need to try to find the smallest number of moves. Encourage groups to check in with those around
  them to see if anyone found a solution with fewer moves. If necessary, before students begin work on the rest of the
  questions, select a student to demonstrate why it takes 3 moves to solve the puzzle with 2 discs as a check that
  everyone understands the rules of the game.</p>

  <p>Use this routine to give students a structured opportunity to revise and refine their explanations for how Jada
    used the solution for 3 discs to help her solve the puzzle for 4 discs. As students share their responses with their
    partner, listeners should press for details and clarity as appropriate based on what each speaker produces. Provide
    students with prompts for feedback that will help individuals strengthen their ideas and clarify their language. For
    example, &ldquo;What pattern did Jada notice?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How do you know your answer is the smallest number of
    moves?&rdquo; Students can borrow ideas and language from each partner to strengthen their final product.</p>

<p>In the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, a set of discs sits on a peg, while there are 2 other empty pegs.</p>
<p>A move in the Tower of Hanoi puzzle involves taking a disc and moving it to another peg. There are two rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Only move 1 disc at a time. </li>
  <li> Never put a larger disc on top of a smaller one. </li>
</ul>
<p>You complete the puzzle by building the complete tower on a different peg from the starting peg.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> What is the smallest number of moves in which you are able to complete the puzzle with 3 discs? </li>
  <p> <strong>Answer: </strong> 7 moves </p>
  <li> What is the smallest number of moves in which you are able to complete the puzzle with 4 discs? </li>
  <p> <strong>Answer: </strong> 15 moves </p>
  <li> Jada says she used the solution for 3 discs to help her solve the puzzle for 4 discs. Describe how this might
    happen. </li>
  <p> <strong>Answer: </strong> For example: Jada moved the tower of discs 1&ndash;3, then moved disc 4, and then moved
    the remaining discs 1&ndash;3 onto it. </p>
  <li> How many moves do you think it will take to complete a puzzle with 5 discs? Explain. </li>
  <p> <strong>Answer: </strong> 31 moves. For example: Double the previous answer, and then add 1. The number of moves
    is 31 because \(2\cdot15+1=31\). </p>
  <li> How many moves do you think it will take to complete a puzzle with 7 discs? </li>
  <p> <strong>Answer: </strong> 127 moves</p>
</ol>
<p>In this activity, you have started to find a sequence of terms.</p>
<p>Write these definitions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A sequence is a list of numbers, possibly going on forever, such as all the odd positive integers arranged in
    order: 1, 3, 5, 7, . . . .</li>
  <li>The term (of a sequence) is one of the numbers in a sequence.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may incorrectly interpret the rules or presume there is no better solution once they find one solution that
  works. Encourage groups to regularly switch who is in charge of moving the discs and to check with other groups around
  them once they think they have found a solution with the smallest number of moves.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>The goal of this discussion is to define sequence and term (of a sequence). This is also an opportunity to establish
  classroom norms regarding the flow of an activity from working time to a synthesis of the main ideas, listening to
  other students&rsquo; explanations, and formally naming important mathematical concepts or objects after students have
  had an opportunity to interact with them.</p>
<p>Begin the discussion by asking students, &ldquo;How many moves does it take to complete the puzzle with 1
  disc?&rdquo; (Just 1, since the puzzle specifies the discs have to end up on a different peg.) Select students to
  share the smallest number of moves they found for 3 and 4 discs. Each time, ask whether anyone in the class solved it
  with fewer moves. If no one finds the minimal solution, ask students to keep looking if time allows, or share the
  minimum number of moves and challenge them to do it, or demonstrate the minimal solution.</p>
<p>Invite previously identified students to share their explanation for Jada&rsquo;s strategy and the number of moves
  needed to complete a puzzle with 5 discs. The bottom row of the table should now have the numbers 1, 3, 7, 15, and 31
  filled in.</p>
<p>Encourage groups to check in with those around them to see if anyone found a solution with fewer moves. If necessary,
  before students begin work on the rest of the questions, select a student to demonstrate why it takes 3 moves to solve
  the puzzle with 2 discs as a check that everyone understands the rules of the game. </p>
<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>
<div>
  <p>Create a display of important terms and vocabulary. Invite students to suggest language or diagrams to include that
    will support their understanding of &ldquo;term&rdquo; and &ldquo;sequence.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>Using a Table to Find the Pattern</h4>
<p>Sometimes it is helpful to keep a table to find the pattern needed to answer a question.</p>
<p>For the Tower of Hanoi game, enter the number of discs used and the smallest number of moves to solve the puzzle in a
  table like the one below. Use the answers from the activity.</p>
<table class="os-raise-horizontaltable">

<p>The pattern was to double the previous answer and then add 1.</p>
<p>Using this pattern, complete the table for 6 discs.</p>
<p>\(2(31)+1=63\)</p>
<p>Then use this rule to find how many moves are needed to complete the puzzle with 8 discs.</p>
<p>There were 127 moves for 7 discs.</p>
<p>So, double 127 and add 1: \(2(127)+1=255\).</p>
<h4>Try It: Using a Table to Find the Pattern</h4>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s your turn. For the same game, how many moves would it take to solve the puzzle with 9 discs?</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to solve this problem using a general strategy:</p>
<p>The pattern is still the same. Double the number of moves before and add 1.</p>
<p>With 8 discs, 255 moves were needed.</p>
<p>Double 255, and then add 1:</p>
<p>\(2(255)+1=511\)</p>
