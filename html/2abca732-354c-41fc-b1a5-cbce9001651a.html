<h4>Recognize the Relation Between the Solutions of an Inequality and its Graph</h4>

<p>Now, we will look at how the
  solutions of an inequality relate to its graph. Let&rsquo;s think about the
  number line shown previously again. The point x = 3 separated that
  number line into two parts. On one side of 3 are all the numbers less
  than 3. On the other side of 3 all the numbers are greater than 3. See
  the figure below.<br></p>

<p>The solution of&nbsp;\( x&gt;3 \) is the shaded part of the number line to the right of&nbsp;\( x = 3 \)</p>
<p>Similarly, the line \(y = x +4\) separates the plane into two regions. On one side of the line are points with \(y &lt; x + 4\). On&nbsp;the other side of the line are the points with \(y &gt; x + 4 \). We call the line \( y &gt; x + 4 \) a <strong>boundary line.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Similarly. for an inequality in two variables. the boundary line is shown with a solid or dashed line to show whether or not&nbsp;it the line is included in the solution.&nbsp;</p>

    <tr>
      <td>\( Ax + By &lt; C \)</td>
      <td>\( Ax + By \leq C \)</td>

      <td>\( Ax + By &gt; C \)</td>
      <td>\( Ax + By \geq C \)</td>

      <td>Boundary line is included in solution.</td>
    </tr>

      <td><strong>Boundary line is dashed.&nbsp;</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Boundary line is solid.&nbsp;</strong></td>
    </tr>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s take a look at what we found in the example above. We&rsquo;ll
  start by graphing the line \( y = x + 4 \), and then we&rsquo;ll plot the five
  points we tested, as shown in the graph. See the figure below.<br></p>
<p><img alt class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="404" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/e779e442c4198dc4bd5d2014d08e1bff3b30c48d" width="400"><br></p>
<p>In the previous example, we found that some of the points were solutions to the inequality&nbsp;\( y &gt; x + 4 \) and some were not.<br></p>
<p>Which of the points we plotted are solutions to the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \)?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The points&nbsp;\( (1, 6) \) and&nbsp;\( (-8, 12) \) are solutions to the
  inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \). Notice that they are both on the same
  side of&nbsp;the boundary line \( y &gt; x + 4 \).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two points&nbsp;\( (0, 0) \) and&nbsp;\( (-5, -15) \) are on the other side
  of the boundary line \( y = x + 4 \), and they are not solutions&nbsp;to the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \). For those two points. \( y &lt; x + 4 \).&nbsp;</p>
<p>What about the point \( (2, 6) \)? Because \( 6 = 2 + 4 \),&nbsp;the point
  is a solution to the equation \( y = x + 4 \), but not a solution&nbsp;to the inequality&nbsp;\( y &gt; x + 4 \) so the point&nbsp;\( (2, 6) \) is on the boundary line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's take another point above the boundary line and test whether or
  not it is a solution to the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \). The&nbsp;point&nbsp;\( (0, 10) \) clearly looks to above the boundary line, doesn't it? Is it a solution to the inequality?&nbsp;</p>
<p>\( y &gt; x + 4 \)<br>\( 10 &gt; 0 + 4 \)<br>\( 10 &gt; 4 \)</p>
<p>So,&nbsp;\( (0, 10) \) is a solution to&nbsp;\( y &gt; x + 4 \).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any point you choose above the boundary line is a solution to the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \). All points above the boundary&nbsp;line are solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, all points below the boundary line, the
  side with&nbsp;\( (0, 0) \) and \( (&minus;5, &minus;15) \), are not solutions to \( y
  &gt; x + 4 \), as shown in the figure below.<br></p>

<p>The graph of the inequality&nbsp;\( y &gt; X + 4 \) is shown in below.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The line&nbsp;\( y = x + 4 \) divides the plane into two regions. The
  shaded side shows the solutions to the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The points on the boundary line, those where\( y = x + 4 \), are not
  solutions to the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \), so the line itself&nbsp;is not part of the solution. We show that by making the line dashed, not solid.&nbsp;</p>
