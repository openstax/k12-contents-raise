<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>Graphing technology should not be used in this cool down.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>To raise money for after-school programs at an elementary school, a group of parents is holding a weekend of games in a community center. They charge $8 per person for entry into the event. The group would like to earn at least $600, after paying for the cost of renting the space, which is $40 an hour.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>If \( x \) represents the number of entry tickets sold and \( y \) the hours of space rental, which inequality represents the constraints in the situation?</li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
<li>\( 8x-40y&lt;600 \)</li>
<li>\( 8x-40y\leq600 \)</li>
<li>\( 8x-40y&gt;600 \)</li>
<li>\( 8x-40y\geq600 \)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> d</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li>The line is the graph of \( 8x-40y=600 \). Select all points whose \( (x,y) \) values represent the group reaching its fundraising goal. Be prepared to show your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Points B and C. Sample explanation: When the coordinates of B and C are substituted for the \( x \) and \( y \) in the equation, they result in a number that is at least 600.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
<li>Complete the graph so that it represents solutions to an inequality that represents this situation. (Be clear about whether you want to use a solid or dashed line.) Use the graphing tool or technology outside the course. Graph the equation that represents this scenario. Students were provided access to Desmos.<br/><br/>

<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
