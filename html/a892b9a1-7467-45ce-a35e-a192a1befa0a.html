<h3>Student Facing Statement</h3>
<div>
  <p>To raise money for after-school programs at an elementary school, a group of parents is holding a weekend of games in a community center. They charge&nbsp;<span>$</span>8 per person for entry into the event. The group would like to earn at least&nbsp;<span>$</span>600, after paying for the cost of renting the space, which is&nbsp;<span>$</span>40 an hour.</p><span>1. If&nbsp;</span><span>\( x \)</span><span>&nbsp;represents the number of entry tickets sold and&nbsp;</span><span>\( y \)</span><span>&nbsp;the hours of space rental, which inequality represents the constraints in the situation?</span>
</div>
<div class="editor-indent">
  <div><span>a. \( 8x-40y&lt;600 \)</span></div>
</div>
<div class="editor-indent">
  <div><span>b. \( 8x-40y\leq600 \)</span></div>
  <div><span>c. \( 8x-40y&gt;600 \)</span></div>
  <div><span>d. \( 8x-40y\geq600 \)</span></div>
</div>
<div><span><br></span></div>
<div><span>2. The line is the graph of&nbsp;</span><span>\( 8x-40y=600 \)</span><span>. Select all points whose&nbsp;</span><span>\( (x,y) \)</span><span>&nbsp;values represent the group reaching its fundraising goal. Explain or Explain your reasoning.<br></span><img alt="Graph of a line." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="221" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/de73a68644c1a0d180237b57db1e8c6e28691206" width="300"><br><span><br></span></div>
<div><span>3. Complete the graph so that it represents solutions to an inequality that represents this situation. (Be clear about whether you want to use a solid or dashed line.)<br></span><br></div>
<h3>Student Response</h3>
<div><span>1. d</span><br><span><br></span></div>
<div><span>2. Points B and C. Sample explanation: When the coordinates of B and C are substituted for the&nbsp;\( x \)&nbsp;and&nbsp;\( y \)&nbsp;in the equation, they result in a number that is at least 600.</span></div>

  <h3>Response to Student Thinking</h3>
</div>
<div>
  <h5>More Chances</h5>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.
