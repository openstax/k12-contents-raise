<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explain the meaning of the term &ldquo;average rate of change.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Estimate or calculate the average rate of change between two points from the graph of a function.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>4.8.1: Comparing Changes in Output Based on Input</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In this activity, you compared the change in output over different periods of the input while looking at a table. You made generalizations about the change over time, without finding the specific rate of change.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>4.8.2: Average Rate of Change and Slope</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In this activity, you learned the average rate of change formula and how to apply it to data given in a table or a graph. You were then able to apply the formula to the generalizations you made in activity 4.8.1 to be more precise in your analysis.</li>
    <li>4.8.2: Self Check</li>
    <li>4.8.2: Additional Resources</li>
  </ul>
  <li>4.8.3: Finding and Interpreting Average Rates of Change
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you used the average rate of change formula to find the average rate of change from a graph. Once you found the average rate of change, you interpreted the average rate of change in the context of the problem.

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>4.8.4 Rate of Change of Linear Functions</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In this activity, you found the rate of change of linear functions from a graph, a table, and an equation.</li>
    <li>4.8.4: Self Check</li>
  </ul>
  <li>4.8.5: Interpreting Average Rates of Change with Real-World Examples</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In this activity, you determined if the rate of change was positive, negative, or zero. Then you looked at the rate of change more precisely and compared larger intervals of time on the graph.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
