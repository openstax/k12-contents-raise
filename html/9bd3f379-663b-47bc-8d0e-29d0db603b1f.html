<h4>Activity</h4>
<p><span>1. A student has a savings account with $475 in it. She deposits $125 of her paycheck into the account every week. Her goal is to save $7,000 for college.</span><br></p>
<p>a. How much will be in the account after 3 weeks?<br><span>b. How long will it take until she has $1,350?<br></span><span>c. Write an equation that represents the relationship between the dollar amount in her account and the number of weeks of saving.<br></span><span>d. Graph your equation using graphing technology. Mark the points on the graph that represent the amount after 3 weeks and the week she has $1,350. Write down the coordinates.<br></span><span>e. How long will it take her to reach her goal?</span></p>
