<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>Earlier, students noticed that when an expression \(kx+m\) is squared and written in standard form \(ax^2+bx+c\), the
  value of \(b\) is \(2km\) and the value of \(c\) is \(m^2\). In this activity, they use these observations to complete
  expressions to make them perfect squares and then write them as squared factors. Then, they apply this skill to solve
  quadratic equations</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>To reiterate the connections between \((kx+m)^2\) and its equivalent expression of the form \(ax^2+bx+c\), display
  these two expressions for all to see and ask students:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> "If the two expressions are perfect squares and are equivalent, how is \(a\) related to \(k\)?" (\(a\) is
    \(k^2\).) </li>
  <li> "How is \(c\) related to \(m\)?" (\(c\) is \(m^2\).) </li>
  <li> "How is \(b\) related to \(k\) and \(m\)?" (\(b\) is \(2km\).) </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell students they will use these insights to complete some squares. Consider keeping students in groups of two.</p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>If students struggle to follow the generalized relationships between \((kx+m)^2\) and its equivalent expression of
  the form \(ax^2+bx+c\) (as discussed in the launch), consider revisiting a concrete example from an earlier
  activity&mdash;for example, \((5x&minus;2)^2\). Ask students to relate each term in the squared factor to the terms of
  its expression in standard form, \(25x^2&minus;20x+4\).</p>
<p>If further scaffolding is helpful, consider using an example with an additional variable (for instance, \((3x+n)^2\)
  and its counterpart in standard form, \(9x^2+2(3)(n)x+n^2)\) before generalizing the equivalence of the two forms in
  entirely abstract terms.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Ask students to write the standard-form expression they invented on a piece of scrap paper, except without the
  constant term (question 3 above). Invite them to switch papers with a partner and complete the square and write each
  other's expressions in factored form. If they get stuck, encourage them to talk with their partner to work together
  and fix any mistakes.</p>
<p>If time permits, invite students to share their responses and strategies. Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> "How did you know what value to use for \(c\) in, say, \(100x^2+80x+c\)?" (\(k^2=100\), so \(k\) is either 10 or
    -10. If \(k\) is 10, then \(2(10)m=80\) and \(m=4\). We know that \(c=m^2\), so \(c\) is 42 or 16. If \(k\) is -10,
    then \(2(-10)m=80\) and \(m=-4\). Squaring -4 still gives 16.) </li>
  <li> "How did you know whether \(c\) would be positive or negative?" (\(c\) is some number squared, so it will always
    be positive.) </li>
  <li> "In the equation \(36x^2&minus;60x+10=-6\), the expression on the left already has 10 as a constant term but it
    is not a perfect square. How do we make it a perfect square?" (25 would make it a perfect square, so we can either
    add 15 to each side of the equation, or first subtract 10 from each side and then add 25.) </li>
</ul>
<p>As students explain their solution methods on the second question, record and display their reasoning for all to see,
  or display a worked solution such as:</p>
<p>\(\begin{aligned} 36 x^{2}-60 x+10 &amp;=-6 \\ 36 x^{2}-60 x+10+15 &amp;=-6+15 \\ 36 x^{2}-60 x+25 &amp;=9 \\ (6
  x-5)^{2} &amp;=9 \end{aligned}\)</p>
<p>
  \(\;\;6x-5=3\;\;\;\mathrm{or}\;\;\;6x-5=-3 \\ \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;6x=8\;\;\;\mathrm{or}\;\;\;6x=2 \\
  \;\;x=\frac86=\frac43\;\;\;\mathrm{or}\;\;\;x=\frac26=\frac13\)</p>

<h4>Find the Value to Make a Perfect Square and Solve</h4>
<p>In earlier lessons, we worked with perfect squares such as \((x+1)^2\) and \((x-5)(x-5)\). We learned that their
  equivalent expressions in standard form follow a predictable pattern:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> In general, \((x+m)^2\) can be written as \(x^2+2mx +m^2\). </li>
  <li> If a quadratic expression of the form \(ax^2+bx +c\) is a perfect square, and the value of \(a\) is 1, then the
    value of \(b\) is \(2m\), and the value of \(c\) is \(m^2\) for some value of \(m\). </li>
</ul>
<p>In this lesson, the variable in the factors being squared had a coefficient other than 1, for example \((3x+1)^2\)
  and \((2x-5)(2x-5)\). Their equivalent expression in standard form also followed the same pattern we saw earlier.</p>

<br>
<p>In general, \((kx+m)^2\) can be written as:</p>
<p>\((kx)^2+2 (kx)(m) +m^2\) or \(k^2x^2+2kmx +m^2\)</p>
<p>If a quadratic expression is of the form \(ax^2+bx+c\), then:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> the value of \(a\) is \(k^2\) </li>
  <li> the value of \(b\) is \(2km\) </li>
  <li> the value of \(c\) is \(m^2\) </li>
</ul>
<p>We can use this pattern to help us complete the square and solve equations when the squared term \(x^2\) has a
  coefficient other than 1&mdash;for example: \(16x^2+40x =11\).</p>
<p>What constant term \(c\) can we add to make the expression on the left of the equal sign a perfect square? And how do
  we write this expression as squared factors?</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> 16 is \(4^2\), so the squared factors could be \((4x + m)^2\). </li>
  <li> 40 is equal to \(2(4m)\), so \(2(4m) = 40\) or \(8m=40\). This means that \(m = 5\). </li>
  <li> If \(c\) is \(m^2\), then \(c =5^2\) or \(c=25\). </li>
  <li> So the expression \(16x^2+40x +25\) is a perfect square and is equivalent to \((4x+5)^2\). </li>
</ul>
<p>Let's solve the equation \(16x^2+40x =11\) by completing the square!</p>
<p> Step 1 </p>
<p> \(16x^2 + 40x = 11\) </p>
<p> To be a perfect square, \( (4x + m)^2 \) is needed. </p>
<p> We found the \(4x\) by determining the square root of the first term, \(16x^2\).&nbsp; </p>
<p> Step 2 </p>
<p> Now, find the value of \(m\) to make a perfect square. </p>
<p> Since \(b = 2km\), and we know that \(k = 4\) (from step 1), and that \(b = 40 \) (from the coefficient of the
  linear term), we substitute the values and solve. </p>
<p> \(40 = 2(4m)\), </p>
<p> \(40 = 8m,\) </p>
<p> so \(m = 5.\) </p>
<p> Step 3 </p>
<p> Find \(c = m^2. \) </p>
<p> \(c = m^2 = 5^2 = 25\) </p>
<p> Step 4 </p>
<p> Add \(c\) to both sides of the equation. </p>
<p> \(16x^2 + 40x + 25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 11&nbsp; + 25 \) </p>
<p> \(16x^2 + 40x + 25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 36\) </p>
<p> Step 5 </p>
<p> Factor and simplify. </p>
<p> \((4x + 5)^2 = 6^2 \) </p>
<p> Step 6 </p>
<p> Take the square root of both sides. Remember the plus or minus. </p>
<p> \((4x + 5)^2&nbsp; = 6^2 \) </p>

<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to solve this equation by completing the square:</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  To be a perfect square, \((2x+m)^2\) is needed. <br>
  \(4x^2+28x=-13\) </p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Find the value of \(m\) to make a perfect square. <br>
  \(2(2m) = 28\), so \(m = 7\).</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Find \(c= m^2\). <br>
  \(c=m^2=7^2=49\)</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  Add \(c\) to both sides. <br>
  \(4x^2+28x+49=-13+49\)</p>
<p>Step 5<br>
  Factor and simplify. <br>
  \((2x+7)^2=36\)</p>
<p>Step 6<br>
  Take the square root of both sides. Remember the plus or minus. <br>
  \(\sqrt{(2x+7)^2}=\sqrt{36}\)<br>
  \( 2x+7= \pm 6\)</p>
<p>Step 7<br>
  Write two equations and solve. <br>
  \(2x+7=6\)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(2x+7=-6\)<br>
  \(x= -\frac12\)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(x=-\frac{13}{2}\)</p>
