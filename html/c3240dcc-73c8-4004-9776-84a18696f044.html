<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Explain why different equations can represent the same sequence.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities </strong>that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    4.18.1: Repeated Addition Is Multiplication
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In this activity, you looked at different ways to represent repeated addition with multiplication and exponents.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    4.18.2: Define a Sequence by the nth Term
    <ul>
      <li>
        In this activity, you learned how to represent sequences with definitions that aren&rsquo;t recursive.
      </li>
      <li>
        4.18.2: Self Check&nbsp;
      </li>
      <li>
        4.18.2: Additional Resources
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    4.18.3: Identify a Domain for a Function
    <ul>
      <li>
        In this activity, you explored two different ways to write the geometric sequence formed by the pattern of the Sierpinski triangle.
      </li>
      <li>
        4.18.3: Self Check&nbsp;
      </li>
      <li>
        4.18.3: Additional Resources
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    4.18.4: Interchanging Between Formulas
    <ul>
      <li>
        In this activity, you learned that arithmetic and geometric sequences can be written using the recursive definition and the nth term. It is possible to use them interchangeably.
      </li>
      <li>
        4.18.4: Self Check
      </li>
      <li>
        4.18.4: Additional Resources
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    4.18.5: Different Types of Equations
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In this activity, you looked at how the same arithmetic sequence was represented recursively and with the nth term.
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following<strong> practice</strong>:</p>
