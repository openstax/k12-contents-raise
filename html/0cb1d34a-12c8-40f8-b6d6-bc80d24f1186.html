<h2>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h2>
<div class="body">
  <p>This warm-up elicits the idea that an equation can contain only letters, with each letter representing a value. It also reminds students that an equation is a statement that two expressions are equal and that different expressions could be used to represent a quantity. Later in this lesson and throughout the unit, students will create, interpret, and reason about equations with letters representing quantities.</p>
</div>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<div class="body">
  <p>Arrange students in groups of 2. For the last question, ask each partner to come up with a new equation.</p>
</div>
<h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>
<p>Here are some letters and what they represent. All costs are in dollars.</p>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span>\( m \) represents the cost of a main dish.</span></li>
    <li><span>\( n \) represents the number of side dishes.</span></li>
    <li><span>\( s \) represents the cost of a side dish.</span></li>
    <li><span>\( t \) represents the total cost of a meal.</span></li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><span>Discuss with a partner: What does each equation mean in this situation?</span>
    <ol>
      <li><span>\( m=7.50 \)</span></li>
      <li>\( m = s + 4.50 \)</li>
      <li>\( ns = 6 \)</li>
      <li>\( m + ns = t \)<br><br></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><span>Write a new equation that could be true in this situation.</span><br></li>
</ol>

<h3>Student Response</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Sample response:<ol>
      <li>A main dish costs&nbsp;<span>$</span>7.50.</li>
      <li>A main dish costs&nbsp;<span>$</span>4.50 more than a side dish.</li>
      <li>Ordering&nbsp;<span>\( n \)</span>&nbsp;side dishes at&nbsp;<span>\( s \)</span>&nbsp;dollars each costs&nbsp;<span>$</span>6.00.</li>
      <li>The total cost of the meal is the cost of a main dish plus the cost of&nbsp;<span>\( n \)</span>&nbsp;side dishes at&nbsp;<span>\( s \)</span>&nbsp;dollars.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Sample responses:<ul>
      <li><span>\( n = 2 \)</span></li>
      <li><span>\( m - s=4.5 \)</span></li>
      <li><span>\( m + 6 = 13.5 \)</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<div class="body">

  <p>Invite students to share their interpretations of the given equations and the new equations they wrote. Then, discuss with students:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&ldquo;What is an equation? What does it tell us?&rdquo; (An equation is a statement that an expression has the same value as another expression.)</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Can equations contain only numbers?&rdquo; (Yes.) &ldquo;Only letters?&rdquo; (Yes.) &ldquo;A mix of numbers and letters?&rdquo; (Yes.)</li>
    <li>&ldquo;The last question asked you to write an equation that could be true. Could this equation be true:&nbsp;<span>\( m + 5 = t \)</span>? How do you know?&rdquo; (It could be. If&nbsp;<span>\( m \)</span>&nbsp;is 7.50 and&nbsp;<span>\( t \)</span>&nbsp;is 12.50, then the equation is true.)</li>
    <li>&ldquo;When might the equation be false?&rdquo; (If&nbsp;<span>\( m \)</span>&nbsp;is 7.50 and&nbsp;<span>\( t \)</span>&nbsp;is anything but 12.50, or if the value of&nbsp;<span>\( t \)</span>&nbsp;is not 5 more than&nbsp;<span>\( m \)</span>, then it is false.)</li>
    <li>&ldquo;One equation tells us that a main dish is&nbsp;<span>$</span>7.50. Another equation tells us that it is equal to the expression&nbsp;<span>\( s + 4.50 \)</span>. Could both be true? Are they both appropriate for expressing the cost of a main dish?&rdquo; (Yes. The first one tells us the price in dollars. The second tells us how the price compares to a side dish.)</li>
  </ul>
