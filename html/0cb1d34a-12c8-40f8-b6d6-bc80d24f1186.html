<h2>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h2>
<p>This warm-up elicits the idea that an equation can contain only letters, with each letter representing a value. It also reminds students that an equation is a statement that two expressions are equal and that different expressions could be used to represent a quantity. Later in this lesson and throughout the unit, students will create, interpret, and reason about equations with letters representing quantities.</p>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. For the last question, ask each partner to come up with a new equation.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here are some letters and what they represent. All costs are in dollars.</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>\( m \) represents the cost of a main dish.</li>
    <li>\( n \) represents the number of side dishes.</li>
    <li>\( s \) represents the cost of a side dish.</li>
    <li>\( t \) represents the total cost of a meal.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
  <p>Here are some letters and what they represent. All costs are in dollars.</p>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>\( m=7.50 \)</li>
  <li>\( m = s + 4.50 \)</li>
  <li>\( ns = 6 \)</li>
  <li>\( m + ns = t \)<br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>For questions 1 - 4, discuss what each <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">equation</span> means with a partner. Then, describe the situation in words. </p>
<p>Write a new equation that could be true in this situation.<br>
</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>\( m=7.50 \)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
<p>main dish costs&nbsp;$7.50.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>\( m = s + 4.50 \)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Your answer may vary, but here are some examples. </p>
<ul>
  <li>  The cost of a main dish is the cost of the side dish plus $4.50.    </li>
  <li>  The cost of a main dish is $4.50 more than the cost of a side dish. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>\( ns = 6 \)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The number of side dishes times the cost of the side dish is \($6\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>\( m + ns = t \)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The main dish added to the quantity of the number of side dishes times the cost of the side dish represents the total cost of the meal.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>Write a new equation that could be true in this same situation. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
<p> Your answer may vary, but here are some examples. </p>
<ul>
  <li>  \(m = 2\)</li>
  <li>  \(m - s = 4.5\)</li>
  <li>  \(m + 6 = 13.5\)</li>
</ul>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
  <li>Describe what your new equation means in words. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
<p>Your answer may vary, but here are some examples.</p>
<ul>
  <li> The main dish costs \($2\). </li>
  <li>  The difference in cost between the main dish and a side dish is \($4.50\).</li>
  <li>  \($13.50\) is the cost of the main dish and a \($6\) tip.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>Invite students to share their interpretations of the given equations and the new equations they wrote. Then, discuss with students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;What is an equation? What does it tell us?&rdquo; (An equation is a statement that an expression has the same value as another expression.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Can equations contain only numbers?&rdquo; (Yes.) &ldquo;Only letters?&rdquo; (Yes.) &ldquo;A mix of numbers and letters?&rdquo; (Yes.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;The last question asked you to write an equation that could be true. Could this equation be true:&nbsp;\( m + 5 = t \)? How do you know?&rdquo; (It could be. If&nbsp;\( m \)&nbsp;is 7.50 and&nbsp;\( t \)&nbsp;is 12.50, then the equation is true.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;When might the equation be false?&rdquo; (If&nbsp;\( m \)&nbsp;is 7.50 and&nbsp;\( t \)&nbsp;is anything but 12.50, or if the value of&nbsp;\( t \)&nbsp;is not 5 more than&nbsp;\( m \), then it is false.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;One equation tells us that a main dish is&nbsp;$7.50. Another equation tells us that it is equal to the expression&nbsp;\( s + 4.50 \). Could both be true? Are they both appropriate for expressing the cost of a main dish?&rdquo; (Yes. The first one tells us the price in dollars. The second tells us how the price compares to a side dish.)</li>
</ul>
