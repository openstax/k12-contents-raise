<h2>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h2>
<div class="body">
  <p>This warm-up elicits the idea that an equation can contain only letters, with each letter representing a value. It also reminds students that an equation is a statement that two expressions are equal and that different expressions could be used to represent a quantity. Later in this lesson and throughout the unit, students will create, interpret, and reason about equations with letters representing quantities.</p>
</div>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<div class="body">
  <p>Arrange students in groups of 2. For the last question, ask each partner to come up with a new equation.</p>
</div>
<h3>Student Facing Statement</h3>
<p>Here are some letters and what they represent. All costs are in dollars.</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span>\( m \) represents the cost of a main dish.</span></li>
    <li><span>\( n \) represents the number of side dishes.</span></li>
    <li><span>\( s \) represents the cost of a side dish.</span></li>
    <li><span>\( t \) represents the total cost of a meal.</span></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
  <p>Here are some letters and what they represent. All costs are in dollars.</p>
</ol>

    <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
      <li><span>\( m=7.50 \)</span></li>
      <li>\( m = s + 4.50 \)</li>
      <li>\( ns = 6 \)</li>
      <li>\( m + ns = t \)<br><br></li>
  </li>
  <p>For questions 1 - 4, discuss what each <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">equation</span>  means with a partner. Then, describe the situation in words. 
  </p>
</ol>

<p><span>Write a new equation that could be true in this situation.</span><br></p>
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li>\( m=7.50 \)</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> main dish costs&nbsp;<span>$</span>7.50.</p>

  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
    <li>\( m = s + 4.50 \)</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong>The cost of a main dish is the cost of the side dish plus $4.50.</p><p>
    The cost of a main dish is $4.50 more than the cost of a side dish. 
    </p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>\( ns = 6 \)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>The number of side dishes times the cost of the side dish is \($6\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>\( m + ns = t \)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>The main dish added to the quantity of the number of side dishes times the cost of the side dish represents the total cost of the meal.</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>Write a new equation that could be true in this same situation. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>  <br>
  Answers vary:<br>
  \(m = 2\)<br>
  \(m - s = 4.5\)<br>
  \(m + 6 = 13.5\)</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
  <li>Describe what your new equation means in words. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>The main dish costs \($2\).<br>
  The difference in cost between the main dish and a side dish is \($4.50\).<br>
  \($13.50\) is the cost of the main dish and a \($6\) tip.
  </p>

  
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<div class="body">
  <p>Invite students to share their interpretations of the given equations and the new equations they wrote. Then, discuss with students:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&ldquo;What is an equation? What does it tell us?&rdquo; (An equation is a statement that an expression has the same value as another expression.)</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Can equations contain only numbers?&rdquo; (Yes.) &ldquo;Only letters?&rdquo; (Yes.) &ldquo;A mix of numbers and letters?&rdquo; (Yes.)</li>
    <li>&ldquo;The last question asked you to write an equation that could be true. Could this equation be true:&nbsp;<span>\( m + 5 = t \)</span>? How do you know?&rdquo; (It could be. If&nbsp;<span>\( m \)</span>&nbsp;is 7.50 and&nbsp;<span>\( t \)</span>&nbsp;is 12.50, then the equation is true.)</li>
    <li>&ldquo;When might the equation be false?&rdquo; (If&nbsp;<span>\( m \)</span>&nbsp;is 7.50 and&nbsp;<span>\( t \)</span>&nbsp;is anything but 12.50, or if the value of&nbsp;<span>\( t \)</span>&nbsp;is not 5 more than&nbsp;<span>\( m \)</span>, then it is false.)</li>
    <li>&ldquo;One equation tells us that a main dish is&nbsp;<span>$</span>7.50. Another equation tells us that it is equal to the expression&nbsp;<span>\( s + 4.50 \)</span>. Could both be true? Are they both appropriate for expressing the cost of a main dish?&rdquo; (Yes. The first one tells us the price in dollars. The second tells us how the price compares to a side dish.)</li>
  </ul>
