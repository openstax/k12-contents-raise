<h4>Activity (40 minutes)</h4>
<p>This is the first of two modeling tasks prompting students to apply what they have learned about exponential growth and decay, as well as about linear functions. Students have just seen how linear functions change by equal differences over equal intervals, and exponential functions change by equal factors over equal intervals, so they are likely to look for these features. They investigate the growth of three city populations over a period of 50 years. The data is real and thus not exactly linear or exponential. But the cities are carefully selected so that one population can be approximated well with a linear function, one can be approximated well with an exponential function, and one is neither linear nor exponential.</p>
<p>When writing equations to model the populations, a natural variable to use is decades, because the populations are only given each decade. Students can choose to use years, but then finding the growth rate for Austin is problematic. If students get stuck, consider suggesting the use of decades to measure time.</p>
<p>Once students create their models and make predictions, consider sharing more recent population data so they can check their predictions.</p>

<p>Monitor for different strategies as students decide which model to use. Students may:</p>
<ul>
  <li> calculate differences and quotients over the decades to see if a linear or exponential model is more appropriate </li>
  <li> plot the population values to see graphically if the data is linear or exponential </li>
</ul>
<p>Once students decide which model to use, they may use different ways to write the equations for the model. Monitor for students who:</p>
<ul>
  <li> use coordinates of two points to find differences or quotients </li>
  <li> find differences or quotients and then find their averages </li>
  <li> fit a line or a curve through the data points to approximate the growth (or use technology to fit a line or a curve) and then find the equation for that line or curve </li>
</ul>
<p>No time estimate is specified for this activity as the length will depend on how students' models are to be presented and discussed. For example, if they are to create visual displays for their models and either present them or do a gallery walk, the activity would require at least one class period.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 3 or 4. Display the populations of the three cities from the warm-up.</p>

<p>Ask students: Can this information be used to predict today's population in the three cities? How? What about the population in 2030? Give students a minute of quiet think time and then time to share their thoughts with their group. Invite groups to share their responses. Highlight responses that suggest that we observe whether each city grows linearly or exponentially (either by calculation or by graphing) and then create mathematical models accordingly.</p>
<p>Provide access to graphing technology. If students are to present their models on visual displays, provide access to tools for creating visual displays.</p>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement </h4>

<h4>Student Response</h4>
<p>Sample response: The data tells us the trend in population change in the three cities between 1950 and 2000. These trends may or may not persist. So the data allows us to make an informed prediction for the population in 2010, 2050, or today but the predictions may not be accurate if conditions in the cities have changed. See the answers to 5 below for some estimates.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Sample response:&nbsp;
    <ul>
      <li> The Paris population is increasing but looks to increase more and more slowly as time goes on.&nbsp; </li>
      <li> The Austin population is increasing more and more rapidly as time goes on.&nbsp; </li>
      <li> The Chicago population is decreasing until the decade from 1990 to 2000 when it increases. The rate of decrease from 1950 through 1990 is not constant.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sample response:&nbsp;
    <ul>
      <li> For Paris, a linear model might be appropriate. The successive differences for the populations are 1,100,000, 800,000, 500,000, 600,000, 400,000. While these are not constant, they show the same general trend upward at a little more than 500,000 per year. This variation in differences is large enough that some may decide a linear model is not appropriate. An exponential model for Paris could also be used with a rate of growth, per decade, at about 1.07. This seems less appropriate than the linear model, however, because the amount of growth each decade is not accelerating (which we would expect if it were growing exponentially).&nbsp; </li>
      <li> For Austin, a linear model is not appropriate because the successive differences are steadily increasing. An exponential model would be appropriate because the successive population quotients, while not all the same, are in a pretty narrow range between 1.36 and 1.42.&nbsp; </li>
      <li> For Chicago, the population is decreasing for most of the period, but then it increases slightly at the end. The successive differences in the population are not that close to being constant so a linear model is not the best&mdash;we could draw a line connecting the initial and final populations but this overestimates the population for much of the time between 1950 and 2000. An exponentially decreasing model is also not appropriate&mdash;the successive quotients are not far from 1, but this will also fail to capture the growth at the end.&nbsp; <br>

      <li> For Austin, the population (in hundred thousands) \(d\) decades after 1950, is modeled by \(g\) where \(g(d)=1.32(1.38)^d\). </li>

  <li>Sample response:&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li> The model for the Paris data fits ok but it's not perfect. While it is not too far off for any of the given decades, there is a trend that indicates that the linear model is probably not the best&mdash;the line consistently underestimates the population for earlier decades and then overestimates the population at the very end. This trend in the residuals indicates that a different model would probably be better.&nbsp; </li>
      <li> The model for Austin fits the data very well. In fact, it is difficult to tell that the variation in successive quotients for the population each decade is significant (from about 1.36 to about 1.42). Maybe since the graph is only for 5 decades, these differences are not substantial enough to be visible.&nbsp; </li>
      <li> For Chicago, we can see that the data does not have an exponential shape. We could use a horizontal line, indicating a constant population of about 3,000,000. But while this is never too far off from any of the given data points, it misses the overall trend in the population change.&nbsp; <br>

    <li>The Paris population predictions could be accurate. The Austin population predictions are likely too large (or certainly will be so as time continues to pass). For Chicago, there is no good linear or exponential model to find the population beyond the year 2000.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may continue to find modeling tasks uncomfortable and challenging. Remind students that real-world data is often very "messy" and we should use the tools we have to approximate and estimate values as best as we can, but it will probably not line up exactly.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Focus the discussion on how students decided on the model to use for Paris and Chicago, and the specific models (the equations) they chose. Either linear or exponential can be justified, though students can also argue that neither of these models is appropriate because neither the successive differences (linear) nor the successive quotients (exponential) are close to being constant.</p>
<p>Ask students what features they would expect in a good linear or exponential model. Important responses include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The population predicted by the model is close to the actual data. </li>
  <li> The general trend predicted by the model respects the data (e.g.,the overall rate of growth for Paris is slowing down as time progresses). </li>
</ul>
<p>Ask students how they went about fitting the line or curve for their linear or exponential models. Possible responses include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> plotting the points and using a ruler to sketch a line that fits the data well, and then finding an equation for the line </li>
  <li> finding a line or exponential curve that goes through two of the data points, and then using it to find the slope or the factor of growth </li>
  <li> finding an average of differences over equal intervals, and then fitting that line through the first data point </li>
  <li> finding an average of factors of growth over equal intervals, and then fitting an exponential function through the first data point </li>
</ul>
<p>If no students chose to plot the data or to test their models using graphing technology, consider demonstrating this to show that the parameters in linear and exponential models can be varied to check the fit of a model. This will help students decide which, if either, is better and also analyze their own models.</p>
<h5> Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<div>
  <p>Conversing: Collect and Display. During the discussion, listen for and collect the language students use to describe linear and exponential situations. Call students&rsquo; attention to language such as &ldquo;successive differences,&rdquo; &ldquo;successive factors or quotients,&rdquo; or key parts of the equation. Write students&rsquo; words and phrases on a visual display and update them throughout the remainder of the lesson. Remind students to borrow language from the display as needed. This will help students compare and contrast linear and exponential models using real-world data.</p>
