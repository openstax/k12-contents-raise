<p>Refer back to the bagel shop activity from the opening lesson. Invite students to consider some statements about the function they saw in that situation. Display the following for all to see:</p>
<p>The best price for bagels, in dollars, is a function of the number of bagels bought, \(n\).</p>
<p>\(b(2)\)</p>
<p>\(b(6)\)</p>
<p>\(b(11)=10.50\)</p>
<p>\(b(13)=11.25\)</p>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Ask partners to take turns reading and interpreting the statements in function notation. Each person should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Read the statement aloud to their partner.</li>
  <li>Identify the input, the output, and the function in the statement.</li>
  <li>Explain the meaning of the entire statement using a complete sentence.</li>
</ul>
<p>If students say that the first two statements have no outputs, clarify that both represent outputs, even though the value of each is not stated.</p>
