<p>In this lesson, you will further develop your ability to describe the characteristics of graphs. You will use mathematical terms such as intercept, maximum, and minimum in your graphical analyses, and you will relate features of graphs to features of the functions represented.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify important features of graphs of functions and explain what they mean in the situations represented.</li>
  <li>Explain and apply the terms &ldquo;horizontal intercept,&rdquo; &ldquo;vertical intercept,&rdquo; &ldquo;maximum,&rdquo; and &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; when talking about functions and their graphs.</li>
  <li>Identify important features of linear functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
