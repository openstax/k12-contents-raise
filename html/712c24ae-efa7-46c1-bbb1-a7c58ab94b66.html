<p>In this lesson, you will work more with growth factors. You will continue to write equations and interpret graphs as you learn about exponential decay.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Use only multiplication to represent &ldquo;decreasing a quantity by a fraction of itself.&rdquo;</li>
<li> Write an expression or equation to represent a quantity that decays exponentially. </li>
<li> Know the meanings of &ldquo;exponential growth&rdquo; and &ldquo;exponential decay.&rdquo;</li>
<li> Explain the meanings of \(a\) and \(b\) in an equation that represents exponential decay and is written as \(y=a \cdot b^x\). </li>
<li> Find a growth factor from a graph and write an equation to represent exponential decay. </li>
<li> Graph equations that represent quantities that change by a growth factor between 0 and 1. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities </strong>that will help you reach those goals:</p>
