<p>In this lesson, you will revisit the idea that not all systems of linear equations have a single solution. Next, you will investigate different ways to determine the number of solutions to a system of linear equations.</p>

<p>Below are the knowledge and skills you will practice in this lesson. Before you begin, read each one and rate how much you currently know about each one. It&rsquo;s okay if your ratings are low; the purpose of this is to check in with yourself about what you do or do not yet know.</p>
<p><strong>Can you...</strong></p>
