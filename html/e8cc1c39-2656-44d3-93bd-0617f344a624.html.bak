<h4>Characteristics of Quadratic Graphs</h4>
<p>The graph of \(y=(x+1)(x-2)\) is shown below.</p>
<p>What are the \(x\)- and \(y\)-intercepts?</p>
<p><img alt="A parabola on a coordinate grid. The x-axis scale is 5 and extends from approximately negative 10 to 10.

<p>The \(x\)-intercepts are where the graph crosses the \(x\)-axis.</p>
<p>This happens at \((-1,0)\) and \((2,0)\).</p>
<p>The \(y\)-intercept is where the graph crosses the \(y\)-axis. </p>
<p>This happens at \((0,2)\).</p>

<p>Here is how to find the intercepts:</p>
<p>For the \(x\)-intercepts: Look at where the graph crosses the \(x\)-axis.</p>
<p>This happens at \(x = – 1\) and \(x = 4\). So the points are \((-1,0)\) and \((4,0)\).</p>
<p>For the \(y\)-intercept: Look at where the graph crosses the \(y\)-axis.</p>
<p>This happens at \(y = 4\) so the point is \((0,4)\).</p>
