<p>In this culminating lesson, you will use polynomials to model dimensions and areas of rectangles. Both activities in the lesson use the dimensions and areas of rectangles to apply the skills of working with polynomials learned throughout the unit.
</p>
<p>In the first activity, you will be given diagrams of rectangles with side lengths labeled and asked to complete a table to find the missing measures of length, width, or area.
</p>
<p>In the second activity, you will be given a table of measures of rectangles, similar to the table in the previous activity. However, you will not have the visual of the rectangles. Again, you will be given the area of rectangles and asked to find the dimensions. 
</p>
<p>In the third activity, you will create your own table with given measures. When you are done, you will trade tables with a partner and work to find the missing measures in their created problem. After the activity, be prepared to discuss the methods you used to create the table.
</p>
<p>Throughout the project, you will have an opportunity to apply the skills of working with polynomials as you add, multiply, divide, and factor polynomials to find the missing measures of rectangles.
