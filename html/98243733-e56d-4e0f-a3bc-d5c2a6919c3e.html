<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>A ceramic sugar bowl weighs 340 grams when empty. It is then filled with sugar. One tablespoon of sugar weighs 12.5 grams.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Write an equation to represent the relationship between the total weight of the
      bowl in grams, \( W \), and the tablespoons of sugar, \( T \).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \( W=340 + 12.5T \), or \( 340 + 12.5T = 740 \)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>When the sugar bowl is full, it weighs 740 grams. How many tablespoons of sugar can the bowl hold? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
<p>32 tablespoons;<br>
  \(740=340+12.5T\)<br>
  \(400=12.5T\); Subtract 340 from both sides.<br>
  \(32=T\); Divide both sides by 12.5.

  <li>The graph represents the relationship between the number of tablespoons of sugar in the bowl and the total weight of the bowl.</li>

<p>Which point on the graph could represent your answer to the previous question?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>  Point D, because its coordinates could be (32, 740).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>About how many tablespoons of sugar are in the bowl when the total weight is 600 grams?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> About 21 tablespoons. Looking at the graph, when the weight is 600, the line is about at 21.</p>
