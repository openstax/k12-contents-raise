<h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>
<div>
  <p>A ceramic sugar bowl weighs 340 grams when empty. It is then filled with sugar. One tablespoon of sugar weighs 12.5 grams.</p>
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li>Write an
      equation to represent the relationship between the total weight of the
      bowl in grams, \( W \), and the tablespoons of sugar, \( T \).
    </li>
    <li>When the sugar bowl is full, it weighs 740 grams. How many tablespoons of sugar can the bowl hold? Be prepared to show your reasoning.
    </li>
    <li>The graph represents the relationship between the number of tablespoons of sugar in the bowl and the total weight of the bowl.

<h3>Student Response</h3>
<div>
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li>
      \( W=340 + 12.5T \), or \( 340 + 12.5T = 740 \)
    </li>
    <li>32 tablespoons</li>
    <li>Point D, as its coordinates could be \( (32, 740) \)
    </li>
    <li>About 21 tablespoons</li>
  </ol>
