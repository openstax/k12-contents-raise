<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>In grade 8, students learned that a linear function has a constant rate of change. Each time the input increases by
  1, the output changes by a particular amount, and this amount is called the rate of change of the function. In this
  activity, students revisit and extend their understanding of this structure. If \(f\) is a linear function, then
  whenever the input \(x\) increases by 2, the output always changes by the same amount. The same is true if 2 is
  replaced by any non-zero quantity. When the input \(x\) changes by the same quantity, the output \(f(x)\) also changes
  by the same quantity.</p>
<p>This idea is connected to the fact that a line representing the linear function has a well-defined slope. Look for
  students who draw slope triangles to calculate the differences in \(x\) and \(y\) and invite them to share during the
  discussion.</p>
<h4> Launch</h4>
<p>Tell students that they will now revisit a linear function to describe its behavior more generally and clearly.
  Later, they will compare and contrast this behavior with that of an exponential function.</p>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Give partners a moment to discuss the first question. Consider asking partners to
  use different pairs of consecutive values when checking how \(f(x)\) changes when \(x\) increases by 1 (for example,
  one partner uses 1 and 2 for the values of \(x\), and the other partner uses 19 and 20).</p>
<p>Briefly discuss students&rsquo; responses and reasoning on the first question before they proceed to the last two
  questions. If no students mentioned evaluating the function at two consecutive values, ask them about it.</p>
<h4>Support for Students with Disabilities</h4>
<div>
  <p>To support development of organizational skills, check in with students within the first 2&ndash;3 minutes of work
    time. Consider pausing after most students have completed the first question for a brief, small-group or whole-class
    discussion before moving on.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here is a graph of \(y=f(x)\) where \(f(x)=2x+5\).</p>
<p><img alt="Graph of an increasing linear function, x y plane, origin O."

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> How do the values of \(f\) change whenever \(x\) increases by 1, for instance, when it increases from 1 to 2, or
    from 19 to 20? Be prepared to explain or show how you know. </li><br>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The value of \(f\) increases by 2 whenever the input increases by 1. For example: </p>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
    <li> From the graph, we can see the \(y\)-value increasing by 2 when the \(x\)-value increases by 1. </li>
    <li> \(f(1)=7\) and \(f(2)=9\). The difference between \(f(1)\) and \(f(2)\) is 2. Likewise, \(f(20)=45\) and
      \(f(19)=43\), and \(f(20)&minus;f(19)=2\). </li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li> Here is an expression we can use to find the difference in the values of \(f\) when the input changes from \(x\)
    to \(x+1\). </li>
  <p>\(\lbrack 2(x+1)+5 \rbrack &minus; \lbrack 2x+5 \rbrack \)</p>
  <p>Does this expression have the same value as what you found in the previous questions? Show your reasoning.</p>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. \(2(x+1)=2x+2\). Replacing \(2(x+1)\) with \(2x+2\) and performing arithmetic gives
    \(f(x+1)&minus;f(x)=2\). </p>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li> How do the values of \(f\) change whenever \(x\) increases by 4? Explain or show how you know. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer: </strong>The values of \(f\) change by 8 if the input is increased by 4. Increasing the input by 4
    is the same as increasing the input by 1 four successive times, and each time the value of \(f\) increased by 2.
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> Write an expression that shows the change in the values of \(f\) when the input value changes from \(x\) to
    \(x+4\). <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(f(x+4)&minus;f(x)\) can be expressed as \(\lbrack 2(x+4)+5 \rbrack&minus; \lbrack 2x+5
    \rbrack \).<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> Show or explain how that expression has a value of 8. </li>
  <br>
  <strong>Answer: </strong>Applying the distributive property to \( \lbrack 2(x+4)+5 \rbrack &minus; \lbrack 2x+5
  \rbrack \) gives us: \(2x+8+5&minus;2x&minus;5\) or \(2x&minus;2x+8+5&minus;5\), which equals 8.
</ol>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>If students seem to have trouble making sense of how the expression \( \lbrack 2(x+1)+5 \rbrack &minus; \lbrack 2x+5
  \rbrack\) represents the change in \(f(x)\) when \(x\) increases by 1, or how the expression has a value of 2,
  consider asking them to reason about the expression as if \(x\) and \(x+1\) were numerical expressions (say, 3 and
  \(3+1\)).</p>
<p>Students may have trouble with the first part of the last question (about how the values of \(f\) change whenever
  \(x\) increases by 4). Ask them to try several pairs of values (e.g., 1 and 5, 3 and 7, etc.) to see if there is a
  pattern. Then, prompt them to refer to how an increase of 1 was expressed algebraically and rearranged in an earlier
  question.</p>
<p>Watch for students who overlook the fact that the change in the value of \(x\) must be 1 if the change in the value
  of \(y\) is the same as the slope.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their responses to the last two questions. Relate the algebraic work done in this activity
  to what students have learned about slope and similar triangles in grade 8. Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Can you find an example where the output of \(f\) does not increase by 2 when \(x\) goes up by 1?&rdquo;
    (No.) &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; (The graph of \(f\), a line, has a particular slope, an amount by which the output
    value changes when \(x\) changes by 1. So any two points on the line whose \(x\)-values are 1 unit apart will have
    \(y\)-values that differ by the value of the slope.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;Can you find an example where the input \(x\) increases by 4, but the output \(f(x)\) does not increase by
    8?&rdquo; (No.) &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; (If increasing the input by 1 always changes the output by 2, then increasing
    by 1 four times always changes the output by 4 times the slope, or \(4 \cdot 2\). Consider showing a graph.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;How does the expression \(\lbrack 2(x+4)+5 \rbrack &minus; \lbrack 2x+5 \rbrack\) show that when \(x\)
    changes by 4, the output changes by 8?&rdquo; (The \(2(x+4)+5\) is the output of \(f\) for \(x+4\). The \(2x+5\) is
    the output of \(f\) for \(x\). Subtracting the two gives us: \(2x+8+5&minus;2x&minus;5\), which is 8.) </li>
</ul>

<p>Emphasize that in any linear function, when \(x\) increases by an equal amount, the output also changes by an equal
  amount.</p>
<p>To further highlight that this observation is true for any linear function, and if time permits, consider showing a
  diagram of an abstract case of a linear function with slope \(s\).</p>
<p>When the input changes by \(a\), the output changes by \(a \cdot s\). (The triangles drawn are similar triangles, so
  the ratios of their corresponding sides are equivalent.)</p>

  <p>Present an incorrect answer and explanation for the question, &ldquo;How do the values of \(f\) change whenever
    \(x\) increases by 4? Explain or show how you know.&rdquo; Consider using this ambiguous response: &ldquo;The values
    of \(f\) change by 6 because I used two points on the graph and counted the spaces.&rdquo; Ask students to identify
    the error, critique the reasoning, and write an improved explanation. As students discuss with a partner, listen for
    students who identify and clarify the ambiguous language in the statement. Invite students to share their critiques
    and corrected explanations with the class. Listen for and amplify the language students use to describe the process
    for finding the amount of change in the graph. This helps students evaluate, and improve on, the written

<h4>Determining Rate of Change of Linear Functions</h4>
<p>For the table below, assume the function \(f\) is defined for all real numbers. Calculate \(\triangle f=f(x+1)-f(x)\)
  in the last column. (The symbol \(\triangle\) in this context means &ldquo;change in.&rdquo;) What do you notice about
  \(\triangle f\)? Could the function be linear or exponential? Write a linear or an exponential function formula that
  generates the same input&ndash;output pairs as given in the table.</p>

<p>For each row, you subtract \(f(x)\) values. The first row would be \(1- (-3) =4\), then \(5 - 1 =4\), then \(9 - 5
  =4\), and then \(13 - 9 = 4\). Think back to the lessons on the slope or rate of change of a linear function. The
  numerator was always the change in \(y\) or output, which is the same as the change in \(f(x)\). Notice that all the
  changes in consecutive terms are the same, 4. This means that there is a constant rate of change and this particular
  function is linear.</p>
<p>Since this function is linear, an equation will have the form \(f(x) = rate \;\ of \;\ change \cdot x+ initial \;\
  value\). The rate of change is 4. The initial value is the same as the \(y\)-intercept, or where \(x=0\). \(f(0)\)
  would be 4 less than the first term listed in this case, which means that \(f(0)= -7\). The linear equation for this
  table would be \(f(x) = 4x -7\).</p>
<h4>Try It: Determining Rate of Change of Linear Functions</h4>
<p>For the graph provided, assume that the function is defined for all real numbers. What is the rate of change? Write
  an equation that would define this function.</p>

<p>Write down your answer. Then select the <strong>solution </strong>button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to write the equation of the graph:</p>
<p>The graph seems to be linear. If you find the rate of change between consecutive points, you find the graph is linear
  and the rate of change is \(\frac12\) since the \(y\)-values increase by 1 every time the \(x\)-values increase by 2.
  Since the graph crosses the \(y\)-axis at \((0,2)\), that is the initial value. The equation for this graph is \(f(x)
  = \frac{1}{2} x +2\).</p>
