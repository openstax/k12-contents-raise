<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Use this information to answer questions 1–7.
</p><blockquote>
<p>A factory produces “widgets” and “zurls.” The combined number of widgets and zurls made each day cannot be more than 12. The maximum number of widgets the factory can produce in a day is 4.</p>
<p>Let <span>\(x\) be the number of widgets and </span>\(y\) be the number of zurls.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>Select <strong>two</strong> inequalities that represent this situation. 
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong>\(x\leq4\) and \(x+y\leq12\)</p>
</li>
<li>Use the graphing tool or technology outside the course. Graph the equations \(x=4\) and \(x+y=12\). (Students were provided access to Desmos.)  
        <p><strong>Answer: </strong> </p>

<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>After graphing the equations \(x=4\) and \(x+y=12\), shade the regions and adjust the line types as needed to show all the allowable numbers of widgets and zurls that the factory can produce in one day. (Students were provided access to Desmos.)

<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>Press Pause</h5>
<p>If students are still struggling to shade graphs appropriately, highlight student work from the cool-down to address misconceptions and assign practice problems from this lesson for additional opportunities for students to practice<br/></p>
