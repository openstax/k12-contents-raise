<p>In this lesson, you will develop two different methods to factor special polynomials. While these polynomials can be factored using the methods from the previous lesson, these special cases allow for a more streamlined approach to factoring. One important skill that you will develop is the ability to recognize when you have a polynomial that fits into these special cases.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Factor perfect square trinomials.
  </li>
  <li>
    Factor differences of squares.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
