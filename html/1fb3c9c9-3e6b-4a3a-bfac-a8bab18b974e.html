<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> What is the average rate of change for the mold over the 6 days? <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> 10.5 square millimeters per day: \(\frac{f(6)&minus;f(0)}{6&minus;0}=10.5\)
  </li>
  <li> How well does the average rate of change describe how the mold changes for these 6 days? <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> The average rate of change does not accurately describe how the mold changes over the 6-day
    period. The first day it only grows by 1 square millimeter, while on the fifth day it grows by 32 square
    millimeters.
  </li>
  <li> How could the average rate of change be more accurate? <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> The domain used to find the average rate of change could be smaller. The average rate of
    change of different intervals could be compared.

<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to
  slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance
  for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current
  understanding.</p>
