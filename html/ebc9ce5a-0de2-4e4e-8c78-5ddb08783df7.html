<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students practice using algebra to solve systems of linear equations in two variables and checking their solutions. Students do not have to use elimination, but the equations in the first two systems conveniently have opposites for the coefficients of one variable, so one variable can be easily eliminated.</p>
<p>In the last two systems, none of the coefficients of the variables are opposites. Some students may choose to solve the systems by substitution, but the process would be pretty cumbersome. The complication students encounter here motivates the need for another move, which students will explore in the next lesson.</p>
<p>Students who opt to use technology to check their solutions practice choosing tools strategically.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Keep students in groups of 2 and provide continued access to graphing technology, in case students need it for checking solutions.</p>
<p>If time is limited, ask one partner in each group to solve the first two systems and the other partner to solve the last two, and then ask partners to check each other&rsquo;s solutions.</p>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<p>Solve each system of equations without graphing and show your reasoning. Then, check your solutions.</p>
<p>System A:\( \left\{ \begin{array}{c l} 2x + 3y = 7 \\ -2x + 4y = 14 \end{array}\right. \)</p>

<p>System B:\( \left\{ \begin{array}{c l} 2x + 3y = 7 \\ 3x - 3y = 3 \end{array}\right. \)</p>

<p>System C:\( \left\{ \begin{array}{c l} 2x + 3y = 5 \\ 2x + 4y = 9 \end{array}\right. \)</p>

<p>System D:\( \left\{ \begin{array}{c l} 6x + 9y = 48 \\ 6x - 5y = 20 \end{array}\right. \)</p><br>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<p>A. \( x = -1 \), \(&nbsp;y = 3&nbsp;\)<br><span>B. \(&nbsp;x = 2&nbsp;\), \(&nbsp;y = 1&nbsp;\)<br></span><span>C. \(&nbsp;x = -3.5&nbsp;\), \(&nbsp;y = 4&nbsp;\)<br></span><span>D. \(&nbsp;x = 5&nbsp;\), \(&nbsp;y = 2&nbsp;\)</span></p>
<h4>Student-Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p><br></p>
<p>This system has three equations:&nbsp;</p>
<p>\( \left\{ \begin{array}{c l} 3x + 2y - z = 7 \\ -3x + 5y +2z = -14\\ 3x + y - z = 10 \end{array}\right. \)</p>
<p>1.Add the first two equations to get a new equation.</p>
<p>2.Add the second two equations to get a new equation.</p>
<p>3.Solve the system of your two new equations.</p>
<p>4.What is the solution to the original system of equations?</p>
<h4>Extension Student Response</h4>
<p>1.\( 7y+z=-7 \)<br><span>2.</span>\( 6y+z=-4 \)<span><br></span><span>3.</span>\( y=-3 \),<span> \( z=14 \)<br></span><span>4.</span>\( x=9 \),&nbsp;<span>\( y=-3 \),&nbsp;\( z=14 \)</span></p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their solutions and strategies for the first three systems and how they check their solutions. Then, focus the discussion on the last system. Solicit the strategies students used for approaching that system. If someone solved it by substitution, display the work for all to see. If no one did, ask if it is possible to do. (If time permits, consider asking students to attempt to do so, or demonstrating that strategy to illustrate that it is not very efficient.)</p>
<p>Discuss questions such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;What happens if we add or subtract the equations?&rdquo; (No variables are eliminated, so it doesn&rsquo;t help with solving.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Why were you able to solve the first three systems by elimination but not the last one?&nbsp;<span>What features were in the equations in those systems but not in the last one?&rdquo; (In the first three systems, at least one variable in each pair of equations has the same or opposite coefficients, so when the terms are added or subtracted, the result is 0.)</span></li>
<li>We need new moves! Tell students that they will explore another way to solve a system by elimination in an upcoming lesson.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
</ul>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<div>
<p>Before students share their solutions and strategies, present an incorrect method of solving a linear system. For example, &ldquo;After the first step when solving the system&nbsp;\( 2x+y=9 \) and \(&nbsp;x&minus;y=3&nbsp;\) by elimination, the resulting equation is \(&nbsp;x=12&nbsp;\).&rdquo; Ask students to identify the error, critique the reasoning, and write a correct explanation. As students discuss with a partner, listen for students who clarify the meaning of the solution to a system. Invite students to share their critiques and corrected explanations with the class. Listen for and amplify the language students use to describe what happens when adding two equations together and explain what the solution should be. This helps students evaluate and improve on the written mathematical arguments of others as they clarify how to find the solution of a linear system by using the elimination method.<br></p>
