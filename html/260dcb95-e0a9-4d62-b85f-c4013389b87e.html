<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In a previous unit, students studied quadratic functions in some depth. They built quadratic expressions to represent situations and wrote equivalent expressions. They also graphed, analyzed, and evaluated quadratic functions to solve problems. In some cases, they investigated and interpreted the outputs of the functions. In others, they looked for the input values that produce certain outputs, and they found these values mainly by reasoning with graphs.</p>
<p>This unit picks up on where that unit left off. Sometimes we have a relationship that can be expressed with a quadratic function, and we want to know what input generates a particular output. How do we find out other than by graphing and estimating, or by guessing and checking?</p>
<p>In this lesson, students encounter a problem that cannot be easily solved by familiar strategies. They will write a quadratic equation and interpret what a solution means in the given situation. The work here motivates the need to solve quadratic equations. In the next lesson, students will see some variations on these equations and work with them in context.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing) </h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> Explain (orally and in writing) the meaning of the solution to a quadratic equation in terms of a situation. </li>
  <li> Write a quadratic equation that represents geometric constraints. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> Explain the meaning of a solution to an equation in terms of a situation. </li>
  <li> Write a quadratic equation that represents a situation. </li>
</ul>
