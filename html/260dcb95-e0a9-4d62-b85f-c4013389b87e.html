<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In a previous unit, students studied quadratic functions in some depth. They built quadratic expressions to represent
  situations and wrote equivalent expressions. They also graphed, analyzed, and evaluated quadratic functions to solve
  problems. In some cases, they investigated and interpreted the outputs of the functions. In others, they looked for
  the input values that produce certain outputs, and they found these values mainly by reasoning with graphs.</p>
<p>This unit picks up on where that unit left off. Sometimes we have a relationship that can be expressed with a
  quadratic function, and we want to know what input generates a particular output. How do we find out other than by
  graphing and estimating, or by guessing and checking?</p>
<p>In this lesson, students encounter a problem that cannot be easily solved by familiar strategies. They will write a
  quadratic equation and interpret what a solution means in the given situation. The work here motivates the need to
  solve quadratic equations. In the next lesson, students will see some variations on these equations and work with them
  in context.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing) </h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Explain (orally and in writing) the meaning of the solution to a quadratic equation in terms of a situation.
  </li>
  <li> Write a quadratic equation that represents geometric constraints. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Explain the meaning of a solution to an equation in terms of a situation. </li>
  <li> Write a quadratic equation that represents a situation. </li>
</ul>

  Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are
  only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.
  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and
    reinforce concept and language attainment </li>
  <li>ELPS 2(I) demonstrate listening comprehension of increasingly complex spoken English by following directions,
    retelling or summarizing spoken messages, responding to questions and requests, collaborating with peers, and taking
    notes commensurate with content and grade-level needs</li>
  <li>ELPS 3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions</li>
  <li>ELPS 4(G) demonstrate comprehension of increasingly complex English by participating in shared reading, retelling or
    summarizing material, responding to questions, and taking notes commensurate with content area and grade level needs
