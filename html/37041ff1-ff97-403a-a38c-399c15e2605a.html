<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity introduces students to using the process of long division to divide polynomials. In the same way that numbers are divided using long division, polynomials can also be divided. While the process is similar, students will learn to use placeholders, such as \(0x^2\), to stand in for a missing term of each degree in a polynomial dividend.</p>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<p>Display the traditional division problem \(960 \div 20\) to students. As a class, work through each individual step, displayed below. If more guidance is needed describing each step, see the Additional Resources section for the detailed description of a similar problem.</p>
<p>\[\begin{array}{l}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,48\\20\left){\vphantom{1{960}}}\right.<br>
\!\!\!\!\overline{\,\,\,\vphantom 1{{960}}}\\\,\,\,\,\,\underline { - 80} \\\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,160\\\,\,\,\,\,\underline { - 160} \\\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,0\end{array}\]</p>
<p>Explain that we will use this process to divide polynomials. Work together to solve the division expression, \((m^2+9m+20) \div (m+4)\), provided in the activity. Ask students to describe each step in the process as they have just done it in the long division problem above. Emphasize that the divisor, \(20\), was one quantity in the process above, so \((m + 4)\) will be one quantity in the process here. Help guide each step if any direction is needed.</p>
<p>Allow time for students to complete the remaining exercises individually.</p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>As students complete the polynomial long division process, students may try to break apart a binomial divisor into individual monomials. Emphasize that the divisor will always be a single quantity in this process.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share questions from the activity. Address any misconceptions about the process. Use the following key concepts to help reinforce the process:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Long division can be performed on polynomials using a very similar process to how it is done using number quantities. </li>
  <li> When performing long division on polynomials, as in other long division, making sure all values are properly aligned is helpful to streamline the process and avoid errors. </li>
  <li> When the dividend is missing terms of each degree from the highest degree down to a degree of zero, add in placeholders with a coefficient of \(0\). </li>
  <li> When you find a remainder, it should be written as a fraction with the remainder in the numerator and the divisor in the denominator. </li>
  <li> You can check your solution by multiplying it by the divisor. The product should be equal to the dividend in the original problem. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Dividing Polynomials Using Long Division</h4>
<p>To divide a polynomial by a binomial, we follow a procedure very similar to long division of numbers. So let&rsquo;s look carefully at the steps we take when we divide a \(3\)-digit number, \(875\), by a \(2\)-digit number, \(25\).</p>
<p><img height="34" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/68e3a4fec0f507563873765a4fe4ee171c2c30e9" width="350"></p>
<p><strong>Step 1 - </strong>Starting from the leftmost digit in the dividend and moving right one digit at a time, find the smallest value possible that is larger than the divisor.</p>
<p><strong>Divide </strong>this value, \(87\), by the divisor, \(25\). Write the whole-number result with no remainder in the space for the quotient.</p>
<p><img height="63" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/6d560526b876d277111b2e64beb88e7c1e8fe79b" width="100"></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> <strong>Multiply</strong> this digit in the quotient by the divisor, \(3 \cdot 25\). </p>
<p>Write the result below the corresponding digits in the dividend.</p>
<p><img height="80" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/2424aa7c0cb5bbe104d266fb3a46fb8378005464" width="112"></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 -</strong> <strong>Subtract</strong> the two values.</p>
<p><img height="102" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/e79e0186961e84a73a14b91343ad3660411c6026" width="112"></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 -  Bring down</strong> the next digit in the dividend.</p>
<p><img height="102" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b9ca5b6670206d68848ee6faa18cde874d62a148" width="112"></p>
<p> <strong>Step 5 - </strong>Repeat the division by dividing the new value, \(125\), by the divisor. </p>
<p>Write the result, \(5\), over the corresponding digit in the quotient.</p>
<p><img height="95" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4c18343a0a016fdf58a81555a6386d62131b51d7" width="105"></p>
<p><strong>Step 6 -  Multiply </strong>this digit in the quotient by the divisor, \(5 \cdot 25\). </p>
<p>Write the result at the bottom below the previous number.</p>
<p><img height="117" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/d62338cb93a56ea6c55187ae25a16b905ce1b16e" width="105"></p>
<p><strong>Step 7 -</strong> <strong>Subtract </strong>the two values. Since there are no more digits to bring down, this value is the remainder. </p>
<p>The quotient is on top.</p>
<p><img height="159" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b7f640649ba205c40c24e872024a7b61362cb3dc" width="225"></p>
<p>We check division by multiplying the quotient by the divisor.</p>
<p>If we did the division correctly, the product should equal the dividend.</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(35 \cdot 25\)</li>
  <li>\(875{\style{color:red}&checkmark;}\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we will divide a trinomial by a binomial. As you read through the Example, notice how similar the steps are to the numerical Example above.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Find the quotient: \((x^2+9x+20) \div (x+5)\).</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> Write it as a long division problem. Be sure the dividend is in standard form.</p>
<p><img alt="." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/04b21d17dec9baa3194d6cf86af5aa4cba8bfc6e" width="200"></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Divide \(x^2\) by \(x\). It may help to ask yourself, &ldquo;What do I need to multiply \(x\) by to get \(x^2\)?&rdquo;</p>
<p><img alt="." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/25c052f7dfcf4f98a83014971ff933cac8225641" width="200"></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 - </strong>Put the answer, \(x\), in the quotient over the \(x\) term. Multiply \(x\) times \(x + 5\). Line up the like terms under the dividend. </p>
<p><img alt="." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/7dde891929abfcb23e3379c9ac1429fe2be8f912" width="200"></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 -</strong> Subtract \(x^2 + 5x\) from \(x^2 + 9x\). You may find it easier to change the signs and then add. Then bring down the last term, \(20\).</p>
<p><img alt="." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/2ee31bc0482996e6b2d393e7a17fdc4f1059ac6e" width="225"></p>
<p><strong>Step 5 -</strong> Divide \(4x\) by \(x\). It may help to ask yourself, &ldquo;What do I need to multiply \(x\) by to get \(4x\)?&rdquo; Put the answer, \(4\), in the quotient over the constant term. </p>
<p><img alt="." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b26317c879d6f7c2be57f39f39eaf7ea98cafd3b" width="225"></p>
<p><strong>Step 6  - </strong>Multiply \(4\) times \(x+5\). </p>
<p><img alt="." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/9f846bcf44e244891a5ec74e633cec9f296cd35f" width="225"></p>
<p><strong>Step 7 -</strong> Subtract \(4x+20\) from \(4x+20\).</p>
<p><img alt="." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/f502a39bb2e7f7c5bdd58309d2c0c45f6f5165c1" width="250"></p>
<p><strong>Step 8 -</strong> Check: Multiply the quotient by the divisor. You should get the dividend.</p>
<p> \((x+4)(x+5)\)<br>
  \(x^2+9x+20{\style{color:red}&checkmark;}\)</p>
<p>When we divided \(875\) by \(25\), we had no remainder. But sometimes division of numbers does leave a remainder. The same is true when we divide polynomials. In the next Example, we&rsquo;ll have division that leaves a remainder. We write the remainder as a fraction with the divisor as the denominator.</p>
<p>Look back at the dividend in the previous Example. The terms were written in descending order of degrees, and there were no missing degrees. The dividend in the next Example will be \(x^4-x^2+5^x-6\). It is missing an \(x^3\) term. We will add in \(0x^3\) as a placeholder.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Find the quotient: \((x^4-x^2+5x-6) \div (x+2)\).</p>
<p>Notice that there is no \(x^3\) term in the dividend. We will add \(0x^3\) as a placeholder.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> Write it as a long division problem. </p>
<p>Be sure the dividend is in standard form with placeholders for missing terms.</p>
<p><img alt="." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b4941ec2c446588b4596a562e5ea96998c9e7a15" width="300"></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Divide \(x^4\) by \(x\).</p>
<p> Put the answer, \(x^3\), in the quotient over the \(x^3\) term. Multiply \(x^3\) times \(x+2\). </p>
<p>Line up the like terms. Subtract and then bring down the next term.</p>
<p><img alt="." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/2c4804a6043e02f1311f02cfb091a6f239203837" width="300"></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 -</strong> Divide \(-2x^3\) by \(x\).</p>
<p> Put the answer, \(-2x^2\), in the quotient over the \(x^2\) term. </p>
<p>Multiply \(-2x^2\) times \(x+1\). Line up the like terms. </p>
<p>Subtract and bring down the next term.</p>
<p><img alt="." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/ed590d433a425ef0a479df42453d4532ed686fbd" width="325"></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 -</strong> Divide \(3x^2\) by \(x\).</p>
<p> Put the answer, \(3x\), in the quotient over the \(x\) term. </p>
<p>Multiply \(3x\) times \(x+1\). </p>
<p>Line up the like terms. Subtract and bring down the next term.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5 - </strong>Divide \(-x\) by \(x\). Put the answer, \(-1\), in the quotient over the constant term. </p>
<p>Multiply \(-1\) times \(x+1\). Line up the like terms. </p>
<p>Change the signs and then add. </p>
<p>Write the remainder as a fraction with the divisor as the denominator.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6 - </strong>To check, multiply \((x+2)(x^3&minus;2x^2+3x&minus;1&minus;\frac{4}{x+2})\). </p>
<p>The result should be \(x^4&minus;x^2+5x&minus;6\).</p>
<p>In the next Example, we will divide by \(2a+3\). </p>
<p>As we divide, we will have to consider the coefficients as well as the variables.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>
<p>Find the quotient: \((8a^3+27) \div (2a+3)\).</p>
<p>This time, we will show the division all in one step. We need to add two placeholders to divide.</p>

<p>To check, multiply \((2a+3)(4a^2-6a+9)\).</p>
<p>The result should be \(8a^3+27\).</p>
