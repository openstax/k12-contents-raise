<p>Ask students to reflect on how they analyzed the behaviors of quadratic and exponential functions. Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;What are some ways for comparing a quadratic growth function and an exponential growth function?&rdquo; (By comparing their values in a table, by graphing the equations representing them, or by comparing the growth factors as the input increases.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;When we compared \(n^2\) and \(2^n\), we saw the value of \(2^n\) become greater than \(n^2\) at \(n=5\). When we compared \(6x^2\) and \(3^x\), we saw \(3^x\) overtaking \(6x^2\) by the time \(x\) reaches \(5\). If we compare, say, \(1,000x^2\) and \(2^x\), will the exponential still overtake the quadratic? If so, at what \(x\)-value do you think it would happen? If not, why not?&rdquo; (Yes. It would probably happen when \(x\) is between \(15\) and \(20\).)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
