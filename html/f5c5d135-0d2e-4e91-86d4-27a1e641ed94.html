<p>In this lesson, you will determine whether situations are characterized by exponential growth or by exponential decay given real-world scenarios of descriptions and graphs.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Use graphs to compare and contrast situations that involve exponential decay. </li>
<li> Use information from a graph to write an equation that represents exponential decay. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
