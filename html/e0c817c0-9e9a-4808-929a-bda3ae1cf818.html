<p>To help students see the connections between the three different forms of quadratic expressions and deepen their understanding of each, consider asking questions such as:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> "The standard form has a constant term: the \(c\) in \(ax^2+bx+c\). The vertex form also has a constant term: the \(k\) in \(a(x&minus;h)^2+k\). Are the two constant terms visible on the graph in the same way?" (No. The \(k\) in vertex form gives us the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex. The \(c\) in standard form gives us the y-coordinate of the \(y\)-intercept. That said, changing these parameters has the same effect of moving the graph up or down.) </li>
  <li> "In both the vertex and standard form, the squared term \(x^2\) has a coefficient (which could be 1). Does this coefficient affect the graph in similar ways?" (Yes, they both influence the direction of the opening of the function's graph and how wide or narrow the opening is.) </li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
