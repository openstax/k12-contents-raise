<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>The equation \(p=5,000\cdot2^t\) represents the population of an invasive fish species in a large lake, \(t\) years since 2005, when the fish population in the lake was first surveyed.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> What was the population in 2005? <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> 5,000, because \(5,000\cdot 2^0=5,000\).
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> What is this value of the population in 2005 in scientific notation? <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(5.0\times 10^3\)
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> For this model, what does it mean when \(t\) is &ndash;2? <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> It means 2 years before 2005, which is 2003.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> For \( t=-2\), is the fish population more or less than 1,000? How do you know? <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> More than 1,000. For \(t=-2\), \(5,000\cdot 2^{-2}=1,250\).
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> Write the value of the fish population when \(t=-2\) in scientific notation. <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(1.25\times 10^3
    \)
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>Points to emphasize</h5>
<p>If students struggle to interpret negative exponents, use student work from this cool-down to guide a brief discussion on the topic in a subsequent lesson.</p>
