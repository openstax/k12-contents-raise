<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity enables students to use inequalities to solve a problem about a situation whose constraints might be unfamiliar and in which multiple quantities are unknown.</p>
<p>To reason about the problem, students need to interpret the descriptions carefully and consider their assumptions about the situation. To make sense of the situation, some students may define additional variables or use diagrams, tables, or other representations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monitor for these approaches students may use to find the possible number of hours of mowing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Start with an empty tank and think about the hours of mowing if there are 0, 1, 2, 3 . . . gallons of gasoline in the tank. (If the tank is empty, Han could mow 0 hours. If it has 1 gallon, he could mow \(\frac1{0.4}\), or 2.5 hours. And so on, up to 5 gallons.)</li>
  <li>Write a series of inequalities and equations (for instance, \(c\leq5\), where \(c\) is the capacity of the tank in gallons, \(c=0.4x\), and \(0.4x\leq5\)) and then solve \(0.4x\leq5\).</li>
  <li>Start with a full tank and the maximum hours of mowing and work down to an empty tank. (If the tank has 5 gallons, Han could mow \(\frac5{0.4}\) hours. If it has 0 gallons, then he could mow 0 hours.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Many students are likely to say that \(x\leq12.5\) represents all possible hours of mowing. Look for students who also specify that \(x\) must be positive or who also write \(x\geq0\) or \(0\leq x\leq12.5\) for the solution set. Ask them to share their thinking with the class during discussion.</p>

  <h5>Support for English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities</h5>
  <p>Use this routine to increase awareness of language used to talk about solutions of inequalities. Display only the context of this problem without revealing the questions that follow. Give students 1&ndash;2 minutes to write their own mathematical questions about the situation, and then invite them to share their questions with a partner. Listen for and amplify any questions that involve possible constraints. Once students compare their questions, reveal the remainder of the task.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Representation: Internalize Comprehension. Represent the same information through different modalities by using a diagram. If students are unsure where to begin, suggest that they draw a diagram of a 5-gallon tank and an unknown quantity of gas. Encourage students to label the diagram with their own interpretations of the significant elements. Look for phrases that indicate students are fully internalizing comprehension of the the diagram and exploring how to apply the information mathematically. For example, look for phrases that lend themselves to translation into mathematical symbols, such as &ldquo;there is at most 5 gallons.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Use the following information to answer questions 1 and 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Han is about to mow some lawns in his neighborhood. His lawn mower has a 5-gallon fuel tank, but Han is not sure how much gasoline is in the tank.</p>
<p>He knows, however, that the lawn mower uses 0.4 gallon of gasoline per hour of mowing.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="A lawnmower on a lawn." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="298" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/91d32b1a0528175404bfe9892fbfac0101cb1c10" width="450"></strong><br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>1. What are all the possible values for \(x\), the number of hours Han can mow without refilling the lawn mower?</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>\(x\leq12.5\) and \(x\geq0\).</p>
<p>2. Write one or more inequalities to represent your response. Be prepared to Be prepared to show your reasoning.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>\(x\leq\frac5{0.4}\) or \(x\leq12.5\) and \(x\geq0\). If the tank is completely full, Han can mow for at most 12.5 hours without refilling. If it is all the way empty, he can mow for 0 hours. It is not possible for Han to mow for a negative number of hours.</p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>For students struggling to express the value of \(x\) as an inequality, suggest they first try reasoning about the question and finding some possible hours of mowing if Han had, say, 1 gallon or 2 gallons of gasoline.</p>
<p>One likely incorrect answer is \(0&le;x&le;2\), the result of multiplying gallons by 0.4 gallons per hour. If students make this mistake, ask, &ldquo;About how long can the mower mow with one gallon of gas?&rdquo; Then, ask if it is reasonable that the mower mows for 2 hours with 5 gallons of gas.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select previously identified students to share their responses, in the order as listed in the Activity Narrative. Also invite students who explicitly stated that \(x\) must be positive to explain why they included that lower boundary in their response.</p>
<p>Emphasize that although it is probably understood from the context that the amount of gasoline in the tank cannot be negative and that the lowest possible number of hours of mowing is 0, it is not apparent from a mathematical statement like \(x\leq12.5\). Writing \(0\leq x\leq12.5\) or \(x\geq0\) and \(x\leq12.5\) makes this assumption explicit and leaves less room for misinterpretation.</p>

  <h4>Using Inequalities to Solve a Problem</h4>
  <p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example where we might be able to solve a problem using inequalities.</p>
  <p>A school is repainting its classroom walls. The school has at most 30 gallons of paint. The painter needs \(\frac52\) gallons of paint for each classroom. How many classrooms can the school paint at most?</p>
  <p>We know that the answer is greater than or equal to 0 classrooms, so \(x\;\geq\;0\).</p>
  <p>We also know that each classroom requires \(\frac52\) or 2.5 gallons of paint.</p>
  <p>Let&rsquo;s take a guess at how many classrooms and check if we are close to the solution. How many gallons of paint would we need to paint 10 classrooms?</p>
  <p>\(10 &times; 2.5 = 25\), and since \(25 &lt; 30\), it could be possible for the school to paint 10 classrooms.</p>
  <p>We can try 11 classrooms.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>\(11 &times; 2.5 = 27.5\), and since \(27.5 &lt; 30\), it could be possible for the school to paint 11 classrooms.</p>
  <p>We can try 12 classrooms.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>\(12 &times; 2.5 = 30\), and since \(30 = 30\), the most classrooms the school could paint is 12 classrooms.</p>
<h4>Try It: Using Inequalities to Solve a Problem</h4>
<p>Use the following information for questions 1 and 2.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>While working in a car factory, a worker can use a drill for as long as the batteries last. The worker has at most 9 fully charged batteries. Each car the worker helps assemble uses \(\frac34\) of a full battery.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li>
    What are all of the possible values for  \(c\), the number of cars the work can help assemble? Write one or more inequalities to represent your response.
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>\(c\le12\) and \(c\ge0\) </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>
  Explain the meaning of the inequalities.
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>If the worker has 9 fully charged batteries, they can help assemble up to 12 cars. If the worker has no batteries, they can assemble 0 cars. It is not possible for the worker to assemble less than 0 cars.</p>
