<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students write systems of inequalities that represent situations and find the solutions by graphing. Students have encountered the same situations and constraints in a previous lesson, so the main work here is on thinking about each pair of constraints as a system, finding the solution region of each inequality, and identifying a point in the region where the graphs overlap as a solution to the system.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2&ndash;4. Explain to students that they will now revisit some situations they have seen and graphed in an earlier lesson. Assign one situation to each group member (or allow them to choose one situation) and ask them to answer the questions. Provide access to graphing technology.</p>
<p>Give students 5&ndash;6 minutes of quiet work time, and then give them time to discuss their responses and graph with their group.</p>

At the appropriate time, give students 2&ndash;3 minutes to plan what they will say when they present their responses and graph to their group. Encourage students to consider what details are important to share and to think about how they will explain their reasoning using mathematical language.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here are some situations you have seen before. Your teacher will give you one situation. Answer the questions for one situation. You will then meet with others in a group. You each will explain the situation and your answers.</p>
<p><strong>Bank Accounts</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>A customer opens a checking account and a savings account at a bank. They will deposit a maximum of $600, some in the checking account and some in the savings account. (They might not deposit all of it and keep some of the money as cash.)</li>
  <li>The bank requires a minimum balance of $50 in the savings account. It does not matter how much money is kept in the checking account.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concert Tickets</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Two kinds of tickets to an outdoor concert were sold: lawn tickets and seat tickets. Fewer than 400 tickets in total were sold.</li>
  <li>Lawn tickets cost $30 each, and seat tickets cost $50 each. The organizers want to make at least $14,000 from ticket sales.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advertising Packages</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>An advertising agency offers two packages for small businesses that need advertising services. A basic package includes only design services. A premium package includes design and promotion. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to sell at least 60 packages in total.</li>
  <li>The basic advertising package has a value of $1,000, and the premium package has a value of $2,500. The goal of the agency is to sell more than $60,000 worth of small-business advertising packages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the discussions you had with your group members, answer the following questions about each situation. </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li aria-level="1">
    Write a system of inequalities to represent the constraints. Specify what each variable represents for the Bank Accounts situation.

<p><br>
For questions 4 - 6, use technology or paper to graph the systems of&nbsp; inequalities you identified in the previous questions. Be sure to alter the scale along each axis to fit the data in the scenario. </p>

  Answer: </strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.<br>
\((150, 300)\) or $150 in the checking account and $300 in the savings account. This combinations meets both requirements. The account owner deposits more than $50 in the savings account and no more that $600 all together.</p></li>

  Answer: </strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.<br>
\((100,250)\) or 100 lawn tickets and 250 seat tickets. This combination of lawn tickets and seat tickets meets both constraints. The sum of tickets is 350, so it is fewer than 400. The dollar amount earned would be \(100(30)+250(50)\), which is \(3,000+12,500\), or 15,500. This is more than $14,000.</p></li>

  <li>Identify a solution to the system that represents the Advertising Packages situation. Explain what the numbers mean in the situation.
<p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-4609b6b3-7fff-d91f-0d57-4c4ec0d4aa2b2"><br>
  Answer: </strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.<br>
\((30,40)\) or 30 basic packages and 40 premium packages. This combination meets the constraints on both the packages sold and the dollar&nbsp;amount collected. \(30+40=70\), so the total number of packages sold is more than 60. The amount collected is \(1,000(30)+2,500(40)\), which is \(30,000+100,000\) or 130,000. This is more than $60,000.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may need reminding what &ldquo;a solution to the system&rdquo; would be in these specific contexts. (First find a point where the total money in the two accounts totals less than or equal to $600. Now make sure the money in the savings account is also at least $50.)</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Much of the discussion would have happened in small groups. During the whole-class discussion, emphasize the meaning of a point in the region where two graphs of linear inequalities overlap. Make sure students understand that all the points in that region represent values that simultaneously meet both constraints in the situation.</p>
<p>If time permits, ask students: &ldquo;Why does it make sense to think of the two inequalities in each situation as a system and find the solutions to the system, instead of only to individual inequalities?&rdquo; (If both constraints in the situation must be met, then we need to find values that satisfy both inequalities.)</p>

<h4>Write a System of Inequalities for a Situation</h4>
<p>For questions 1–4, use the following scenario to write, graph, and find solutions to a system of inequalities.</p>
<blockquote>Christy sells her photographs at a booth at a street fair. At the start of the day, she wants to have at least 25 photos to display at her booth. Each small photo she displays costs her $4, and each large photo costs her $10. She doesn&rsquo;t want to spend more than $200 on photos to display.</blockquote>
