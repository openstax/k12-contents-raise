<h4>Activity</h4>
<p></p>
<h4>Launch </h4>
<p>Give each student a piece of graph paper or a coordinate grid. Have students recall how to plot a point with the \(x\)-value before the \(y\)-value.</p>
<p>Arrange students in pairs.</p>
<p>Encourage students to check with their partner at each step to compare their work before moving on to the next step. Have students explain their steps to their partner.</p>
<br>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>In this activity, students will work to graph equations written in standard form using the \(x\)- and \(y\)-intercepts by hand, not technology. They will then use the graphs to find the slope of the lines. </p>

 <p> The teacher may choose to begin to associate the slope of the equation of the line in this form to \(-\frac{A}{B}\). Students will later graph these equations using graphing technology in lesson 1.10, so it is helpful for students to understand how to complete the process on their own.</p>
<p>For questions 1-7, use the equation \(3x + 4y =12\)</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis </h4>
<p>Facilitate a discussion with students with them explaining how they found their answers.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Ask: &ldquo; How did you find your \(x\)-intercepts and \(y\)-intercepts?&rdquo; </li>
  <li> Ask: &ldquo;How did you find your slope?&ldquo; </li>
  <li> Ask: &ldquo;Why do you think an \(x\)-intercept is also called a zero or solution?&rdquo; </li>
  <li>Ask: â€œWhat did you notice about the numbers in the equation and the numbers in the intercepts and slopes?&ldquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>If time allows, try another example and ask the questions again and reflect if their analysis was accurate. </p>

<h4>Graphing a Line and Describing Characteristics</h4>
<p>There are many ways to graph an equation of a line. One way is to use the \(x\)-intercepts and \(y\)-intercepts as two points on the line.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Graph \(3x -6y =18\) using the intercepts, then identify key characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Find the \(x\)-intercept.<br>
  To find the \(x\)-intercept, let \(y=0\).</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}3x -6y &amp;=&amp;18\\3x -6(0) &amp;=&amp;18\\3x&amp;=&amp;18\\x&amp;=&amp;6\end{array}\)</p>
<p>\((6,0)\) is the \(x\)-intercept<br>
  The \(x\)-intercept is also called a solution or zero.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Find the \(y\)-intercept.<br>
  To find the \(y\)-intercept, let \(x=0\).</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}3x -6y &amp;=&amp;18\\3(0) -6y &amp;=&amp;18\\-6y &amp;=&amp;18\\y&amp;=&amp;-3\end{array}\)</p>
<p>\((0, -3)\) is the \(y\)-intercept</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Graph the line by connecting the \(y\)-intercepts.<br>
  [INSERT IMAGE HERE] </p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Find the slope of the line.</p>
<p>\(\mathrm{slope}=\frac{\mathrm{rise}}{\mathrm{run}}=\frac36=\frac12\)</p>
