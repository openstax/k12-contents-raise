<h3>Activity </h3>
<p>You are walking along a beach, and your toe hits something hard. You reach down, grab onto a handle, and pull out a lamp! It is sandy. You start to brush it off with your towel. Poof! A genie appears.</p>
<p>He tells you, “Thank you for freeing me from that bottle! I was getting claustrophobic. You can choose one of these purses as a reward.”</p>
<ul>
<li> Purse A, which contains $1,000 today. If you leave it alone, it will contain $1,200 tomorrow (by magic). The next day, it will be $1,400. This pattern of an additional $200 per day will continue. </li>
<li> Purse B, which contains 1 penny today. Leave that penny in there because tomorrow it will (magically) turn into 2 pennies. The next day, there will be 4 pennies. The amount in the purse will continue to double each day. </li>
</ul>
