<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4><span id="docs-internal-guid-0b99e1ca-7fff-07c1-a9cf-a78210134b56">
  <p>This activity highlights some ways to decide whether the solution set to an inequality is greater than or less than a particular boundary value (identified by solving a related equation).</p>
  <p>Students are presented with two approaches to solving an inequality. Both characters (Priya and Andre) took similar steps to solve the related equation, which gave them the same boundary value. But they took different paths to decide the direction of the inequality symbol.</p>
  <p>One solution path involves testing a value on both sides of the boundary value, and another involves analyzing the structure of the inequality. The former is more familiar given previous work. The latter is less familiar and thus encourages students to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.</p>
  <h4>Launch</h4>
  <p>In a class discussion, reintroduce the inequality \(-\frac12x + 6 &lt; 4x - 3\) from Activity 2.8.6. Remind students there are several methods that can be used to solve the inequality. Ask students for suggestions for the first step in solving. Discuss possible first steps, including adding \(\frac12x\) to both sides and multiplying both sides by 2. Ask students to identify any other possible first steps. Reinforce that as long as both sides of the inequality are treated equally, multiple methods are possible, and the solution found will be the same.</p>
  <p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Give students a few minutes of quiet time to make sense of what Andre and Priya have done, and then time to discuss their thinking with their partner. Pause for a class discussion before students move to the second set of questions and try to solve inequalities using Andre&rsquo;s and Priya&rsquo;s methods.</p>
  <p>Select students to share their analyses of Andre&rsquo;s and Priya&rsquo;s work. Make sure students can follow Priya&rsquo;s reasoning and understand how Priya decided on \(x&lt;3\) by focusing her comparison on \(4x+3\) and \(18-x\).</p>

Andre solved the companion equation and found \(3 = x\). Then, he tested a number greater than 3. That created a false mathematical statement so he concluded that any number greater than 3 would not be a solution.

Priya solved the companion equation and found \(x = 3\). Then, she reasoned that the left side of the equation, \(4x + 3\), could be either negative or positive while the right side of the equation, \(18 - x\), would always be positive - if negative \(x\) values for are substituted into the expressions. So, the possible values for \(x\) need to include both positive and negative numbers. That happens when the \(x\) values are less than 3.

      <p>Inequality A: \(15p\gt−10\)</p>

        <li>\(p>-50\). Sample reasoning (after solving \(15p=-10\) to get \(p=-50):\)
          <ul>
            <li>
              Using Andre's strategy: Test a value more than or less than -50, and check to see if that value gives a true statement when substituting back to the original inequality.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using Priya's strategy: If \(p\) is a negative number that is far away from 0, say -100, then \(\frac15p\) will be less than, not greater than, -10. This means the solutions must include positive numbers, so the solutions must be greater than -50.

      <br>
      <p>Inequality B: \(4(x+7)\leq4(2x+8)\)</p>

        <li>
          Sample reasoning using Priya's strategy (after solving \(4(x+7)=4(2x+8)\) and getting \((x=-1)\):
          <ul>
            <li>
              After dividing each side by 4, the left side of the inequality has \(x\), while the right side has \(2x\). This means the expression on the left side will be less than that on the right when \(x\) includes positive numbers, so \(x\) must be greater than or equal to -1. (In other words, for most negative values of \(x\), \(2x\) will be less than \(x\), which would make the inequality untrue.)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
  
      </ul>
      <p>Inequality C: \(−9n\lt36\)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sample reasoning using Priya's strategy (after solving \(-9n=36\) to get \(n=-4\)):
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If \(n\) includes large positive numbers, then \(-9n\) will be smaller than 36, so \(n\) must include positive numbers which are greater than -4.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If \(n\) is less than -4, then it would include negative numbers like -10, which means the value of \(-9n\) would be a positive number that is greater than 36, which makes the inequality untrue. So the solution must be greater than -4.
                </li>
              </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p>Inequality D: \(3c\lt−2(c−7)\)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sample reasoning using Priya's strategy (after solving \(c3=-2(c−7)\) and getting c=6):
          <ul>
            <li>
              The right side of the inequality has \(-2c\) while the left side has \(13c\). If \(c\) is a large positive number, \(-2c\) will be less than \(13c\). If \(c\) is a negative number, \(-2c\) will be positive and greater than \(13c\), so the solution must include negative numbers which are less than 6.

  <h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
  <p>Students who perform procedural steps on the inequality may find incorrect answers. For instance, in the third inequality, they may divide each side by \(-9\) and arrive at the incorrect solution \(n&lt;-4\). Encourage these students to check their work by substituting numbers into the original inequality.</p>
  <h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
  <p>Students should recognize that the solution set for each inequality should be the same regardless of the reasoning method used.</p>
  <p>Select as many students as time permits to share how they used a strategy similar to Priya&rsquo;s to determine the solution set of each inequality. There may be more than one way to reason structurally about a solution set. Invite students who reason in different ways to share their thinking. Record and display their thinking for all to see.</p>

  <h4>Reasoning about Solution Sets to Linear Inequalities</h4>
  <p>You can derive a lot of information about the solution set to an inequality by studying the inequality itself. <br></p>
  <p>Let&rsquo;s look at the inequality shown.</p>
  <p>\(12x&gt;-3(x-1)\)</p>
  <p>The left side of the inequality contains \(12x\). The right side of the inequality contains \(-3x\).</p>
  <p>We can think to ourselves: &ldquo;What values of \(x\) would make \(12x\) greater than \(-3x\)?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>If \(x\) is a large positive number, then \(12x\) will still be positive. If \(x\) is a large positive number, then \(-3x\) will be a negative number. This makes the inequality true, so the solution set must include large positive numbers.</p>
  <p>Let&rsquo;s solve the related equation.</p>
  <p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}12x&amp;&gt;&amp;-3(x-1)\\12x\;&amp;=&amp;\;&ndash;3(x\;&ndash;\;1)\\12x\;&amp;=&amp;\;&ndash;3x\;+3\\15x\;&amp;=&amp;\;3\\x\;&amp;=&amp;\;\frac{3}{15}\end{array}\)</p>
  <p>Since we know that the solution set must include large positive numbers, then \(x &gt; \frac{3}{15}\) must be the solution to the inequality.</p>
  <h4>Try It: Reasoning about Solution Sets to Linear Inequalities</h4>
  <p>For questions 1 and 2, solve the related equation for each inequality. Use what you know about the inequality to determine the solution set.</p>

</ol>        	
<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p>The solution \(y = -6\). Since any positive number substituted for \(y\) makes \(-5y\) a negative value, then the solution set cannot include positive numbers. This means the solution is \(y\leq-6\).</p>

<li>\(4p&lt;-4\)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p>The solution \(p = -1\). Since any positive number substituted for \(p\) makes \(4p\) a positive value, the solution set cannot include positive numbers. This means the solution is \(p &lt; -1\).</p>
