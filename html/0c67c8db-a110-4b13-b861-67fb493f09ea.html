<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity prompts students to notice the structure that relates quadratic expressions in factored form and their
  equivalent counterparts in standard form. Students began this work earlier in the course. They applied the
  distributive property to expand an expression such as \((x + 5)(x + 4)\) into standard form, using rectangular
  diagrams to help organize and keep track of the partial products. Here, the focus is on using the structure to go in
  reverse: rewriting into factored form an expression given in standard form.</p>
<p>The expressions students encounter here are two sums or two differences, in the form of \((x + m)(x + n)\) or \((x
  &minus; m)(x &minus; n)\). When working with two differences, it is helpful to think of subtracting \(m\) and \(n\) as
  adding \(-m\) and \(-n\) and labeling the diagrams accordingly. For example, for the last expression, \((x &minus;
  1)(x &minus; 7)\), one side of the diagram should be labeled with \(x\) and &ndash;1, and the other side should be
  labeled with \(x\) and &ndash;7.</p>

<p>Students might say \((x + (-6))(x + (-2))\) or \((x &minus; 6)(x &minus; 2)\). Whether they mention both or not,
  write both expressions for all to see and emphasize that they are equivalent.</p>
<p>When we want to represent \((x &minus; 6)(x &minus; 2)\), it is convenient to think of it as \((x + (-6))(x + (-2))\)
  and label the diagram as such, so that we keep track in the diagram of what is positive and negative.</p>
<p>Then, ask students what expression or number goes in each blank rectangle. Make sure students see that the rectangles
  are used to organize the partial products of \((x &minus; 6)(x &minus; 2)\), the sum of which is \(x^2&minus; 8x +
  12\).</p>

<p>The binomial factors \((x + 7)\) and \((x + 9)\) have been placed in the cells along the horizontal and vertical edge

<p>To find the internal cells, the terms in each factor are multiplied together.</p>
<p>Then, the like terms in the product cells are combined. Notice that \(7x + 9x\) results in the linear term of our
  second expression, \(16x\) (from \(x^2+16x+63\)).</p>
<p>Use a diagram to show that each pair of expressions is equivalent. It is helpful to rewrite any subtraction
  expressions as adding the opposite before starting, as has been modeled in questions 2 and 5.</p>

  <li>Review the pairs of expressions that involve the product of two sums or two differences that you just diagramed.
    How is each expression in factored form (the first expression placed into the cells along the horizontal and
    vertical edge of the diagram) related to the equivalent expression in standard form (the second expression that
    results from the product cells)?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Because the coefficients of the \(x\)-terms are both 1 in the factored form, when the two
  numbers that appear in factored form are added, the result is the coefficient of \(x\) in standard form. If those same
  two numbers are multiplied, the result is the constant term in standard form. (Note that this explanation relies on
  recasting every subtraction expression as adding the opposite.)</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their diagrams and observations. Make sure students notice that the linear term in the
  expression in standard form is the sum of the two numbers in the expression in factored form, and the constant term is
  the product of the two numbers in the expression in factored form. (For this explanation to be succinct, it requires
  rewriting any subtractions as adding the opposite.)</p>

<p>So, the expressions are equivalent.</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 2</p>
<p>The same can be done with two factors using subtraction as well.</p>
<p>\((x &minus; 6)(x &minus; 9)\) </p>
<p>\(x^2 &minus; 15x + 54\)</p>
<p>It is helpful to rewrite the factored form as the addition of negative numbers when subtracting occurs in the
  factors.</p>
<p>So \((x &minus; 6)(x &minus; 9)\) becomes \((x + (-6))(x + (-9))\). Now the process is the same.</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Let's populate the table.</p>
<table class="os-raise-doubleheadertable os-raise-skinnytable">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">&nbsp;</th>
      <th scope="col">
        \(x\)
      </th>
      <th scope="col">
        &ndash;6
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">
        \(x\)
      </th>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">
        &ndash;9
      </th>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Multiply the columns and rows.</p>
<table class="os-raise-doubleheadertable os-raise-skinnytable">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">&nbsp;</th>
      <th scope="col">
        \(x\)
      </th>
      <th scope="col">
        &ndash;6
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">
        \(x\)
      </th>
      <td>
        \(x^2\)
      </td>
      <td>
        \(-6x\)
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">
        &ndash;9
      </th>
      <td>
        \(-9x\)
      </td>
      <td>
        54
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Use the diagram to write the expression in standard form.</p>
<p>\(x^2&minus;15x+54\)</p>
<p>The expressions are equivalent.</p>
<p>When the coefficients of the \(x\)-terms are both 1 in the factored form:</p>
<p>Take notice that the linear term (\(x\)-term) in the expression in standard form is the sum of the two numbers in the
  expression in factored form.</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> In the example above, the term \(-15x\) is the sum of the two numbers &ndash;9 and &ndash;6. </li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the constant term is the product of the two numbers in the expression in factored form.</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> In the example above, the term 54 is the product of the two numbers &ndash;9 and &ndash;6. </li>
</ul>
<p>Recognizing this will be helpful for switching between standard and factored forms. Remember, this pattern only
  occurs when the coefficients of the \(x\)-terms in the factors are 1 (because they result in a quadratic term that has
  a coefficient of 1 as well, \(x^2\)).</p>
