<p>In this lesson, you will draw and interpret area diagrams and use the distributive property to write quadratic equations in factored and standard forms.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Rewrite quadratic expressions given in factored form in standard form using either the distributive property or a diagram. </li>
<li> Know the difference between &ldquo;factored form&rdquo; and &ldquo;standard form.&rdquo; </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
