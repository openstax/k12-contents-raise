<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>Students just explored the connections between quadratic functions expressed in factored form and their graphs. In
  this lesson, they experiment with the graphs of quadratic functions expressed in standard form and reason about how
  the parameters of the expressions&mdash;specifically the coefficient of the squared term and the constant
  term&mdash;relate to features of the graphs. Students use technology to change these values and produce the graphs.
  They study the effects and generalize their observations.</p>
<p>Then, students practice identifying equivalent quadratic expressions in standard and factored form and their
  corresponding graph. To do so, they look for and make use of structure. The work here strengthens students'
  understanding of the ties across various representations of quadratic functions.</p>
<p>Note that when students graphed equations in factored form earlier, they dealt mostly with monic quadratic
  expressions, in which the coefficient \(a\) in \(ax^2+bx+c\) is 1 and the factored expression is in the form of
  \((x+m)(x+n)\). Limiting the examples to such expressions enables students to see more easily the connections between
  the numbers in the factors and the \(x\)-intercepts of the graphs. When graphing from the standard form, that
  limitation is not necessary, as the connections between the coefficient \(a\) and the features of the graph can be
  studied and revealed more straightforwardly.</p>
<p>(In a later unit, students will learn to use the zero product property to solve quadratic equations. At that time,
  they will revisit the factored form and how it reveals the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph, including for non-monic
  quadratic expressions that can be written as \((px+m)(qx+n)\).)</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Comprehend (orally and in writing) how the \(a\) and \(c\) in \(ax^2+bx+c\) are visible on the graph. </li>
  <li> Coordinate (orally and in writing) different representations of quadratic functions (expressions, tables, and
    graphs). </li>
  <li> Use technology to explore how the parameters of quadratic expressions in standard form are visible on the graph.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Explain how the \(a\) and \(c\) in \(ax^2+bx+c\) affect the graph of the equation. </li>
  <li> Explain how graphs, tables, and equations that represent the same quadratic function are related. </li>
</ul>
