<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>In a previous lesson, students used equations defining functions to reason about graphs. Here they work in the
  opposite direction, analyzing graphs and creating corresponding equations. In the first question, the coordinates
  given are not of two consecutive values of \(x\), so students need to reason about the decay factor indirectly. They
  may:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Try different factors that, when multiplied by \(f(0)\) twice, give \(f(2)\). </li>
  <li> Use the graph to estimate \(f(1)\), and then use that estimate to find a reasonable decay factor. </li>
  <li> Find the factor that takes \(f(0)\) to \(f(2)\) (or \(f(2)\) to \(f(4)\)), recognize that number as \(b^2\), and
    then find \(b\). </li>
</ul>
<p>The second question has no context and is thus more abstract. This prepares students to interpret graphs in the next
  activity, where minimal information is given.</p>
<h4> Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Ask students to take a few minutes of quiet time to think individually on each
  question before discussing their thinking with a partner.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p> Examine the graph representing an exponential function \(f\). The function \(f\) gives the value of a computer, in
  dollars, as a function of time, \(x\), measured in years since the time of purchase. </p>
<p><img alt="GRAPH OF AN EXPONENTIAL DECAY FUNCTION, WHERE VALUE IN DOLLARS IS A FUNCTION OF TIME.

<p>Based on the graph, what can you say about the following?</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> The purchase price of the computer <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> $400 <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> The value of \(f\) when \(x\) is 1 <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(f(1)=200\) <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> The meaning of \(f(1)\) <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> The value of the computer after 1 year <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> How the value of the computer is changing each year <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer: </strong> The computer loses half of its value each year. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> An equation that defines \(f\) <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(f(x)=400(\frac{1}{2})^x\) or equivalent (i.e., \(f(x)=400 \cdot (0.5)^x\)). <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Whether the value of \(f\) will reach 0 after 10 years&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> No, it will not. After 10 years, the value of the computer will be a little less than
    $0.40.

<h4> Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5> Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>Consider a function \(f\) defined by \(f(x)=a \cdot b^x\).</p>
<p>If the graph of \(f\) goes through the points \((2,10)\) and \((8,30)\), would you expect \(f(5)\) to be less than,
  equal to, or greater than 20?</p>
<p>If the graph of \(f\) goes through the points \((2,30)\) and \((8,10)\), would you expect \(f(5)\) to be less than,
  equal to, or greater than 20?</p>
<h4>Extension Student Response</h4>
<p>The value 20 is what you would get for \(f(5)\) if \(f\) were a linear function through \((2,10)\) and \((8,30)\) (or
  \((2,30)\) and \((8,10)\)). Looking at graphs representing our exponential functions, we can see that the line
  connecting two points on the graph always seems to be above the graph of the exponential function itself. Thus, we
  would expect \(f(5)&lt;20\) in both cases.</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>If students have trouble getting started, ask them to consider the graph and say what they know is true about the
  situation that the graph represents. Most likely, they will answer some parts of the first question by doing this and
  will be in a better position to figure out any questions they didn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<h4> Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students to share their responses to the first four questions. Write the exponential model,
  \(y=ab^x\), on the board. Ask students what each variable represents. Help facilitate the following connections with
  students: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The value of \(a\) is the initial value, in this case, the starting price, $400.
    <ul>
      <li>Ask students, no matter what the value of \(b\), if \(x =0\), what is the value of the function? 400.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The value of \(b\) is the growth factor. In this problem, the value of the computer decays. In question 4,
    students should have answered that the computer loses half its value every year, therefore \(b = \frac{1}{2}\).
  </li>
  <li>Note that since \(b = \frac{1}{2}\) which is less than 1, the model will represent the decay. </li>
  <li>Ask students what would happen if \(b\) is greater than 1.</li>
  <li>If students are willing to share their different equations, this is a great time to address any mistakes and
    misconceptions of the formula in a constructive manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>For question 6, begin to introduce the concept of an asymptote since the value will not reach 0. Ask students if at
  10 years and beyond, is there any part of the computer that will still be worth something to someone? </p>
<p>For the last graph, discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;What information is needed to describe an exponential function?&rdquo; (the factor of growth or decay and
    the initial value) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;Where on the graph do we see the initial value?&rdquo; (the \(y\)-intercept of the graph) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;What points on the graph can we use to help us find the growth factor?&rdquo; (the points \((-1,40)\) and
    \((0,20)\), or the points \((0,20)\) and \((2,5)\)) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;Why might \((-1,40)\) and \((0,20)\) be a more strategic choice than \((0,20)\) and \((2,5)\) for finding
    the factor of growth?&rdquo; (The \(x\)-coordinates of first two points differ by 1, so the quotient of the
    \(y\)-coordinates of those points can be used to find the factor of decay. It is a more direct way to find the
    factor of decay, which is the factor by which the output of \(f\) changes when the input \(x\) changes by 1. In the
    second pair, the \(x\)-coordinate changes by 2.) </li>
</ul>
