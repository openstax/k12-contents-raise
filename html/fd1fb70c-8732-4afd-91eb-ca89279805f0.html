<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>Earlier, students recognized that an expression in standard form can be written as a perfect square and learned to
  write it that way. Here, they learn to use that skill to solve quadratic equations.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Consider keeping students in groups of two.</p>
<p>Display for all to see the two solution methods in the activity statement. Ask students if the quadratic expression
  in the original equation is a perfect square. Then, ask them to study the methods and make sense of the steps.
  Afterward, discuss with students:</p>
<ul>
  <li> "How are the two solution methods alike?" (They both involve making the expression on the left a perfect square.
    They are the steps for solving the same equation, so the solutions are the same.) </li>
  <li> "How are they different?" (In the first solution, Diego first subtracted 9 from each side, and then added 25 to
    complete the square. In the second, Mai added 16 to 9 because that is what is needed to make 25.) </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell students that either method works, but some people prefer the first approach because moving the original
  constant term to the other side of the equal sign (the right side, in this case) allows them to see what constant term
  is needed to make a perfect square on the left side. They also find it to be less prone to errors.</p>

<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>Here is a diagram made of a square and two congruent rectangles. Its total area is \(x^2+35x\) square units.</p>
<p>Diagram A</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>What is the length of the unlabeled side of each of the two rectangles in Diagram A?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 17.5</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>In Diagram B, we add lines to make the figure a square. The area of the square becomes a quadratic equation.</li>

<p>Calculate the equation, then put that equation in the standard form \(ax^2+bx+c\) to answer questions a and b.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
  <li>Using the standard form \(ax^2+bx+c\) to represent the area of the square in Diagram B, what is the value of the

  <li>How is the process of finding the area of the entire figure like the process of building perfect squares for

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> First, we had to figure out what number was half of 35 (which is 17.5) to find the side

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students to share their solutions to questions 1 &ndash; 5 and to display their reasoning for all to see.
  Encourage students to explain how they used the worked solutions to help solve the equations on their own. After each
  student presents, ask if others found the same solution but completed the square in a different way. Make sure
  students see that the steps could vary, but the solutions should be the same if equality between the two sides of the
  equal sign is maintained throughout the solving process.</p>
<p>Ask students how they could check their solutions. One way is by substituting the solutions back into the equation
  and seeing if the equation is true at those values of the variable. For example, to see if -4 and -2 are the right
  solutions to the equation \(x^2+6x+8=0\), we can evaluate \((-4)^2+6(-4)+8\) and \((-2)^2+6(-2)+8\) and see if each
  has a value of 0. Both \(16&minus;24+8\) and \(4&minus;12+8\) give 0, so the solutions are correct.</p>
<p>For students who need more scaffolding, print out the worked solutions and have students label the steps. They can
  then use these steps to help them solve questions 1 &ndash; 5. Students may also benefit from working so that each
  partner takes a turn doing one step in the process.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>That's correct! Check yourself: Add 25 to each side to create a perfect square trinomial. The equation
          becomes \((x-5)^2=16\). Taking the square root of each side, the equation becomes \(x-5= \pm \;4\). This
          results in two solutions.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Solving Quadratic Equations by Completing the Square</h4>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example</p>
<p>Solve \(x^2+8x=48\) by completing the square.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Isolate the variable terms on one side and place the constant term on the other.<br>
  This equation has all the variables on the left.<br>
  \({\style{color:red}a}{\style{color:red}x}^{\style{color:red}2}\;{\style{color:red}+}\;{\style{color:red}b}{\style{color:red}x}\;{\style{color:red}=}\;{\style{color:red}c}\)<br>
  \(x^2+8x=48\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Find (\(\frac{b}{2})^2\), the number to complete the square. Add to both sides of the equation.<br>
  Take half of 8 and square it.<br>
  \(4^2=16\)<br>
  Add 16 to BOTH sides of the equation.<br>
  \(x^2+8x+ \_\_\_\_ =48\)<br>
  \((\frac{b}{2})^2\)<br>
  \(x^2+8x\; {\style{color:red}+}\; {\style{color:red}1}{\style{color:red}6} =48 \;{\style{color:red} +
  }\;{\style{color:red}1}{\style{color:red}6}\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Factor the perfect square trinomial as a binomial square.<br>
  \(x^2+8x+16=(x+4)^2\)<br>
  Substitute the binomial square term for the trinomial.<br>
  \((x+4)^2=64\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Use the square root property.<br>
  \(\sqrt{(x+4)^2}=\sqrt{64}\)<br>
  \(x+4= \pm \;8\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> - Simplify the radical and then solve the two resulting equations.<br>
  \(x+4= \pm \;8\)<br>
  \(x+4=8\)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(x+4=-8\)<br>
  \(x =4\) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(x=-12\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong> - Check the solutions.<br>
  Put each answer in the original equation to check.</p>
<p> Substitute \(x=4\).<br>
  \(x^2+8x=48\)<br>
  \(({\style{color:red}4})^2+8({\style{color:red}4}) = 48\)<br>
  \(16+32 = 48\)<br>
  \(48=48 ✔\)</p>
<p>Substitute \(x=-12\). <br>
  \(x^2+8x=48\)<br>
  \(({\style{color:red}-}{\style{color:red}1}{\style{color:red}2})^2+8({\style{color:red}-}{\style{color:red}1}{\style{color:red}2})
  = 48\)<br>
  \(144-96 = 48\)<br>
  \(48=48 ✔\)</p>
<h4>Try It: Solving Quadratic Equations by Completing the Square</h4>
<p>Solve \(x^2+4x=5\) by completing the square.</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to solve this quadratic using completing the square:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Isolate the constants on one side of the equation.<br>
  \(x^2+4x=5\)&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Find \((\frac{b}{2})^2\). Add this number to both sides of the equation.<br>
  \(b=4\), \((\frac{4}{2})^2=2^2=4\)<br>
  \(x^2+4x+4=5+4\)<br>
  \(x^2+4x+4=9\)&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Factor the perfect square trinomial.<br>
  \((x+2)^2=9\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Use the square root property.<br>
  \(\sqrt{(x+2)^2}=9\)<br>
  \(x+2= \pm \;3\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> - Separate into two equations and solve.<br>
  \(x+2=-3\)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(x+2=3\)<br>
  \(x =-5\) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(x=1\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong> - Check into the original equation.<br>
  \(x=-5\)<br>
  \((-5)^2+4(-5)=5\)<br>
  \(25+-20=5\) </p>
<p> \(x=1\)<br>
  \(1^2+4(1)=5\)<br>
  \(5=5\)</p>
