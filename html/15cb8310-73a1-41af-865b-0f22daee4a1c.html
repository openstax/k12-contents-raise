<p>Arthur Noriega has to consider constraints when purchasing new equipment and uniforms for the Fire and Rescue Department. He can represent the constraints with equations and then use graphs of equations to make sense of constraints and identify values that satisfy them.</p>
<p>As you proceed through this section, you will learn to recognize moves that transform one equation into an equivalent equation. You will use these moves to manipulate equations to solve for a certain variable. You will also learn how the form and parts of a linear equation in two variables are related to the features of its graph.</p>
<p>This section includes 6 lessons:</p>
