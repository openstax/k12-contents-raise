<p>Arthur Noriega has to consider constraints when purchasing new equipment and uniforms for the Fire and Rescue Department. He can represent the constraints with equations and then use graphs of equations to make sense of constraints and identify values that satisfy them.</p>
<p>As you proceed through this section, you will learn to recognize moves that transform one equation into an equivalent equation. You will use these moves to manipulate equations to solve for a certain variable. You will also learn how the form and parts of a linear equation in two variables are related to the features of its graph.</p>
<p>This section includes 6 lessons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Equivalent Equations</li>
  <li>Explaining Steps for Rewriting Equations</li>
  <li>Which Variable to Solve For? (Part1)</li>
  <li>Which Variable to Solve For? (Part 2)</li>
  <li>Connecting Equations to Graphs (Part 1)</li>
  <li>Connecting Equations to Graphs (Part 2)</li>
</ul>

<p>This Section Overview Video provides a closer look at the individual lessons within this section, and provides teachers with pacing and instructional suggestions for successful classroom implementation. </p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FE10AKbYAcI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
