<h2>Activity (10 minutes)</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>This activity allows students to apply what they learned about meeting multiple constraints simultaneously and to practice solving simple systems of equations in context. Students are given several problems that can be efficiently solved by writing and solving systems.</p>
<p>As students work, notice the strategies they use. Many students may choose to graph the systems because that strategy was used in the first activity, but some students may choose to solve the systems by guessing and checking, by creating tables, or by reasoning algebraically. (In middle school, students learned the substitution method for solving systems of equations. Expect students to have varying degrees of facility with it at this point.)</p>
<p>Making graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically.</p>
</div>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<div>
<p>Keep students in groups of 2 and provide them with continued access to graphing technology.</p>
<p>Tell students that they will now look at several situations that also involve two quantities and two constraints. Their job is to represent each pair of constraints by writing a system of equations and then to find a solution to the system.</p>
<p>Give students 3&ndash;4 minutes of quiet time to think about the first question and then a minute to share their thinking with their partner before proceeding with the rest of the activity. Leave a couple of minutes for whole-class discussion. If time is limited, ask each student to solve two of the questions.</p>
</div>
<h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>
<div>
<p>Here are some situations that each relate two quantities and involve two constraints. For each situation, find the pair of values that meet both constraints and explain or show your reasoning.</p>

<li>
<p>A dining hall had a total of 25 tables: some long rectangular tables and some round ones. Long tables can seat 8 people. Round tables can seat 6 people. On a busy evening, all 190 seats at the tables are occupied.</p>
<p>How many long tables,&nbsp;<span>\( x \)</span>, and how many round tables,&nbsp;<span>\( y \)</span>, are there?</p>

<h3>Student Response</h3>
<p>There are many ways to solve these equations: graphing and algebraic solving, guessing and checking, or using tables. Answers are:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>20 long tables and 5 round tables. Sample reasoning:<ul>
<li><span>\( x + y = 25 \)</span></li>
<li><span>\( 8x + 6y = 190 \)</span></li>
<li><span>\( x+y=25 \)</span>&nbsp;can be rewritten as&nbsp;<span>\( y=25-x \)</span>. Substituting&nbsp;<span>\( 25-x \)</span>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<span>\( y \)</span>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<span>\( 8x + 6y = 190 \)</span>&nbsp;gives&nbsp;<span>\( x = 20 \)</span>. If&nbsp;<span>\( x \)</span>&nbsp;is 20, then&nbsp;<span>\( y \)</span>&nbsp;is 5.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>7 adult tickets and 9 child tickets. Sample reasoning:<ul>
<li><span>\( a + c = 16 \)</span></li>
<li><span>\( 10.50a + 7.50c = 141 \)</span></li>
<li>When the equations are graphed, the intersection of the two lines is at&nbsp;<span>\( (7,9) \)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>$</span>4.95 for a large poster and&nbsp;<span>$</span>2.30 for a small poster. Sample reasoning: When the equations&nbsp;<span>\( 2\ell + 3s = 16.80 \)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>\( \ell + 4s = 14.15 \)</span>&nbsp;are graphed, the intersection of the two lines is at&nbsp;<span>\( (4.95,2.30) \)</span>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Student-Facing Extension</h3>
<h4>Are you ready for more?</h4>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Make up equations for two lines that intersect at&nbsp;<span>\( (4,1) \)</span>.</li>
<li>Make up equations for three lines whose intersection points form a triangle with vertices at&nbsp;<span>\( (-4,0) \)</span>,&nbsp;<span>\( (2,9) \)</span>, and&nbsp;<span>\( (6,5) \)</span>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Extension Student Response</h3>
<div>
<p>Sample responses:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>\( x=4 \)</span>,&nbsp;<span>\( y=1 \)</span></li>
<li><span>\( y=\frac32x + 6 \)</span>,&nbsp;<span>\( y= -x+11 \)</span>,&nbsp;<span>\( y=\frac12x+2 \)</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>
<div>
<p>If students struggle to sort out the information in a problem, suggest that they start by drawing a picture or diagram to help understand the situation. Another idea is to start by creating one or more tables to list possible combinations of values and observe the relationship between the values.</p>
<p>For students who need more scaffolding, ask questions such as: &ldquo;What equation can you write to say that the number of tables, long tables and round ones, is 25?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What do your variables represent?&rdquo; Then, ask students to use the same variables to write an equation that says that there are 190 seats.</p>
</div>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<div>
<p>Select students who use different strategies to share their responses and reasoning. Start with strategies that are less systematic (such as guessing and checking) and move toward those that are more systematic (graphing or using algebra). If possible, display their work for all to see. After each student presents, ask if others solved it the same way.</p>
<p>If no students share an algebraic strategy, ask if anyone solved the problems without graphing. If so, invite them to share their rationale. Otherwise, it is not crucial to probe further at this moment.</p>
<p>If time permits, ask students to reflect on the strategies that were used. Some of them&mdash;graphing and algebraic solving&mdash;required writing equations. Others&mdash;guessing and checking or using tables&mdash;did not. Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Why might it be helpful to write a pair of equations to solve these problems?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Are there situation in which it might not be helpful to write equations?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Support for English Language Learners</strong></h4>
<p></p><strong>
<div>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Prior to the whole-class discussion, invite students to select one of the situations and to create a visual display of their work. Students should consider what to include on the display so that other students will be able to interpret how they found a pair of values that met both constraints. Students may wish to add notes or details to their displays to help communicate their reasoning. Begin the whole-class discussion by selecting and arranging 2&ndash;4 displays for all to see. Give students 1&ndash;2 minutes of quiet think time to interpret the displays before inviting the authors to share their strategies as described in the lesson synthesis.</span></p>

<h3>Meeting Constraints in a Real-World Situation</h3>
<div>Let&rsquo;s look at a situation similar to the activity and discuss how to find values that meet the constraints given.<br></div>
<div>
<div><br></div>
<div><strong>THEATER SEATS&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>A movie theater sells two types of tickets for a movie showing. Stadium recliner seats cost $18 each, and regular seats cost $15 each. The theater has a total of 40 seats. When every seat is sold, the theater earns $648 in ticket sales. How many stadium recliner seats, \(x\), and regular seats, \(y\), are there?</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>To solve this problem, we first need to recognize that there are two constraints in this situation. The constraints are the total number of seats in the theater and the total money earned from sales. Let&rsquo;s write an equation to represent each constraint.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><strong>Constraint #1: the total number of seats</strong></div>
<div><br></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="editor-indent">
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>There are \(x\) stadium recliner seats and \(y\) regular seats representing a total of 40 seats.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="editor-indent">
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>This is represented by the equation \( x + y = 40 \).</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><br></div>
<div><strong>Constraint #2: the total sales from the seats</strong></div>
<div><br></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="editor-indent">
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Stadium recliner seats cost $18 and regular seats cost $15, for a total of $648.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><br></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="editor-indent">
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>This is represented by the equation \(18x + 15y = 648\).</div>
