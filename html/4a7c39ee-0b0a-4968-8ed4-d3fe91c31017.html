<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p><span>In this activity, students recall the meaning of inequality symbols (&lt;, &gt;, &le;, and &ge;) and the meaning of &ldquo;solutions to an inequality.&rdquo; They are reminded that an inequality in one variable can have a range of values that make the statement true. Students also pay attention to the value that is at the boundary of an inequality and consider whether it is or isn&rsquo;t a solution to an inequality.</span><br></p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Give students 1&ndash;2 minutes of quiet work time. Follow with a whole-class discussion.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement&nbsp;</h4>

<h4>Student Response</h4>

<li>Answers<ul>
<li><span>a: 2, \( h &gt; 50 \): &ldquo;greater than&rdquo;</span></li>
<li><span>b: 1, \( h &le; 20 \): &ldquo;less than or equal to&rdquo;</span></li>
<li><span>c: 3, \( 30 &ge; h \): &ldquo;greater than or equal to&rdquo;</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Yes; 25 is a solution to \( 30 &ge; h \) because 30 is greater than or equal to 25.</span><br></li>
<li>No; 40 is not a solution to any of the inequalities because 40 does not make any of the inequalities true when substituted in for \( h \).<br></li>
<li>Yes; 30 is a solution to \( 30 &ge; h \) because, while \( 30 &gt; 30 \) is not a true statement, \( 30 = 30 \) is a true statement.<br></li>
</ol>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Draw students&rsquo; attention to the last inequality \( (30&ge;h) \). Make sure students see that, even though the symbol is read &ldquo;greater than or equal to,&rdquo; it doesn&rsquo;t mean that we&rsquo;re looking for values that are greater than or equal to 30. The statement reads &ldquo;30 is greater than or equal to \( h \),&rdquo; which means \( h \) must be less than or equal to 30.</p>
<p>Next, ask students how they know whether each of those numbers (the 50, 20, and 30, or the boundary values) is a solution to the inequality. Emphasize that we can test those boundary values the same way we test other values: by checking if they make the statement true.</p>
<p>Display these equations in one variable for all to see: \( h=50 \), \( h=20 \), and \( 30=h \). Discuss with students how these equations are different from the inequalities in one variable (aside from the fact that the symbols are different). Highlight the idea that there is only one value that could make each equation true, but there is a range of values that can make each inequality true.</p>
