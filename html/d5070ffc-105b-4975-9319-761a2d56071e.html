<p><strong>Sections: </strong>After the overview and readiness lesson, the rest of the lessons are organized into sections.</p>
<p><strong>Quizzes:</strong> Opportunities to test out your new algebra skills! In each unit you will find Section Quizzes, a Unit Quiz, and a STAAR Review.</p>

<h3>III. Lesson Walk-Through</h3>

<p><strong>Lesson Activities</strong></p>
<p>As you progress through the lesson, you will do different types of activities:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Warm-up</li>
    <li>Primary activities (These are unique and need extra focus. We’ll take a close look at them in the next part of this guide)</li>
    <li>Cool-down</li>
    <li>Practice</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Primary Activities:</strong> Here’s an example of one of these unique types of activities, each lesson has 2-3 of these. After you have finished the activity you will take a multiple-choice question called, "Self Check".</p>
<p><strong>Are you ready for more?:</strong> This button opens additional questions for you to expand your thinking. This section is optional, unless otherwise stated by your teacher.</p>
<p><strong>Next:</strong> After completing an activity, be sure to press the "Next" button at the bottom of the page. This will take you to the self-check question.</p>

<p>Self Check: This is a self-check question. If you get the answer correct, congratulations you get to move on to the next activity! If you get the answer incorrect, you will be directed to an additional resource page where you can review the topics and retake the self-check question.</p>
