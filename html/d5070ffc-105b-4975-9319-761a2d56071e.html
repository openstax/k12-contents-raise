    <p><strong>Overview and Readiness:</strong> Before starting a new unit we recommend taking the overview and readiness lesson. This will help you review topics for the unit and prepare for the new material you will be learning (Image 3).</p>
    <p><strong>Sections:</strong> After the overview and readiness lesson, the rest of the lessons are organized into sections. At the end of each section you will have an opportunity to test out your new algebra skills with a section quiz (Image 3).</p>
<p><strong>Quizzes:</strong> At the end of each unit you will find a Unit Quiz, and a STAAR Review (Image 4).</p>
<p><strong>Additional Items:</strong> At the end of each unit you will also find a project and wrap up page covering the topics in the unit (Image 4).</p>

<p>The first page of a lesson is called “Lesson Overview.” Here you will find the different types of activities included in the lesson (Image 5).</p>
<ul> 
        <li><strong>Warm up:</strong> This is the first activity in a lesson.</li>
        <li><strong>Primary activities:</strong> These are unique and need extra focus. We'll take a close look at them in the next part of this guide.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool-down:</strong> This is the last activity in a lesson.</li>
        <li><strong>Practice:</strong> This is a practice page with problems on the topics you learned in the lesson.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Primary Activities</h5>
<p>Here's an example of one of these unique types of activities. Each lesson has 2-3 of these. After you have finished the activity you will take a multiple choice question called, “Self Check.”</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Are you ready for more?: </strong>This button opens additional questions for you to expand your thinking. This section is optional, unless otherwise stated by your teacher (Image 6).</li>
    <li><strong>Tip:</strong> After completing an activity, be sure to press the “Next” button at the bottom of the page. This will take you to the self check question.</li>
    
</ul>
<h5>Self Check</h5>
<p>This is a self check question (Image 7). If you get the answer correct, congratulations you get to move on to the next activity! If you get the answer incorrect, you will be directed to an additional resource page where you can review the topics and retake the self check question.</p>
