<h4>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this warm-up, students reason about whether and when the sums of equations are true. The work here prepares students for the next activity, where they begin to think about why the values that simultaneously satisfy two equations in a system also satisfy the equation that is a sum of those two equations.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. For the last question, ask each partner to come up with a new equation.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>In questions 1â€“5, use the equation 50+1=51 to answer the questions.</p>
<p>Perform each of the following operations and explain what each of the resulting equations look like. Is it still a true equation?</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Add 12 to each side of the equation. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>\(50 + 1 + 12 = 51 + 12\) or \(63 = 63\) (or equivalent).<br>
  Yes. It is still a true statement because <br>
  63=63. </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li> Add \(10 + 2\) to the left side of the equation and 12 to the right side. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>\(50 + 1 + 10 + 2 = 51 + 12\) or \(63 = 63\) (or equivalent).<br>
  Yes. It is still a true statement because \(63=63\). </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li> Add the equation \(4 + 3 = 7\) to the equation \(50 + 1 = 51\). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>\(50 + 1 + 4 + 3 = 51 + 7 or 58 = 58\) (or equivalent).<br>
  Yes. It is still a true statement because \(58=58\). </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li> Write a new equation that, when added to \(50 + 1 = 51\), gives a sum that is also a true equation. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p> \(8 + 2 = 10\). Added to the original equation gives:<br>
  \(50 + 1 + 8 + 2 = 51 + 10\) or \(51 + 10 = 61\) or \(61 = 61\).</p>
<p>\(a + a = 2a\). Added to the original equation gives: <br>
  \(50 + 1 + a + a = 51 + 2a\) or \(51 + 2a = 51 + 2a\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li> Write a new equation that, when added to \(50 + 1 = 51\), gives a sum that is a false equation. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
<p>\(3 + 2 = 7\). Added to the original equation gives:<br>
  \(50 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 51 + 7\) or \(56  \neq 58\), which is false.</p>
<p>\(a + 2 = a\). Added to the original equation gives:<br>
  \(50 + 1 + a + 2 = 51 + a or 53 + a \neq 51 + a\), which is false.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Ask students to share their responses to the first three questions. Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Why do you think the resulting equations remain true even after we add numbers or expressions that look different to each side?&rdquo; (The numbers being added to the two sides are always equal amounts, even though they are written in a different form.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Suppose we subtract 12 from the left side of \( 50 + 1= 51 \) and subtract \( 5 + 7 \) from the right side. Would the resulting equation still be true?&rdquo; (Yes. \( 50 + 1 - 12 \) is \( 39 \), and \( 51 - (5 + 7) \) is also \( 39 \). The same amount, 12, is subtracted from both sides.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Here is another equation: \( 50 + 1 = 60 \). Suppose we subtract 12 from the left side of that equation and \( 5 + 7 \) from the right side. Would the resulting equation still be true? Why or why not?&rdquo; (No. The given equation is a false statement. Subtracting the same amount from both sides will keep it false.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Invite students to share their equations for the last two questions. Display the equations for all to see. If no one shares an equation that uses a variable, give an example or two (as shown in the Student Responses).</p>
<p>Make sure students understand that adding (or subtracting) the same amount to each side of a true equation keeps the two sides equal, resulting in an equation that is also true. Adding (or subtracting) different amounts to each side of a true equation, however, makes the two sides unequal and thus produces a false equation.</p>
