<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity gives students another opportunity to represent a relationship with numbers and letters, to reason
  repeatedly, and to see more clearly that equations are helpful for generalizing a relationship.</p>
<p>From the given descriptions, students are aware that there are four relevant quantities in the car purchase
  situations. In each situation, the value of at least one quantity is not given, creating a need for students to name
  it by using a word or a phrase (for instance, &ldquo;total price&rdquo; or &ldquo;original price&rdquo;) or to use a
  variable (for example,&nbsp;\( T \)&nbsp;or&nbsp;\( p \)). Some students might choose to use a symbol. Monitor for the
  different ways students represent these quantities.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Ask students if they have had to pay sales tax when making a purchase and, if so, to briefly explain how sales tax
  works.</p>
<p>Explain to students that a car purchase also involves a sales tax. Car buyers pay not only the price of a car, but
  also a tax that is a certain&nbsp;percentage&nbsp;of the car price. Car dealerships also often charge their customers
  various fees.</p>
<p>Tell students that they will now write&nbsp;equations&nbsp;to describe the relationship between the price of the car,
  the tax, a fee, and the total price. Emphasize that it is not necessary to evaluate any&nbsp;expressions&nbsp;or
  perform any computations.</p>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Give them a few minutes of quiet work time and then a minute to discuss their
  responses with a partner. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>The tax on the sale of a car in Michigan is 6%. At a dealership in Ann Arbor, a car purchase also involves $120 in
  miscellaneous charges.</p>
<p>There are several quantities in this situation: the original car price, sales tax, miscellaneous charges, and total
  price. </p>
<p>For questions 1 - 4, write an equation to describe the relationship between all the quantities when given specific
  information. </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>The original car price is $9,500.</li>
</ol>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Answer: \(&nbsp;ùëá = 9,500 + 0.06(9,500) + 120&nbsp;\), or \(&nbsp;ùëá = 1.06(9,500) + 120&nbsp;\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>The original car price is $14,699.</li>
</ol>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Answer: \(&nbsp;ùëá = 14,699 + 0.06(14,699) + 120&nbsp;\), or \(&nbsp;ùëá = 1.06(14,699) + 120&nbsp;\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>The total price is $22,480.</li>
</ol>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Answer: \(&nbsp;22,480 = ùëù + 0.06ùëù + 120&nbsp;\), or \(&nbsp;22,480 = 1.06ùëù + 120&nbsp;\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>The original price is \( p \).</li>
</ol>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Answer: \( ùëá = ùëù + 0.06ùëù + 120&nbsp;\), or \(&nbsp;ùëá = 1.06ùëù + 120 \)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li> How would each equation you wrote change if the tax on car sales is \( r \)% and the miscellaneous charges are \(
    m \) dollars?</li>
</ol>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Answer:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>\( ùëá = 9,500 + \frac{r}{100}(9,500)+m \)</li>
  <li>\(ùëá = 14,699 + \frac{r}{100}(14,699)+m\)</li>
  <li>\(22,480=p+\frac{r}{100}(p)+m\)</li>
  <li>\(T=p+\frac{r}{100}(p)+m\)</li>
</ol>
<p>Equations equivalent to these are also acceptable.</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may be taken aback by the prompt to write an&nbsp;expression&nbsp;relating four quantities. If they
  have trouble getting started, suggest that they simply calculate the cost of buying a&nbsp;$9,500 car, taking care to
  show their work.</p>
<p>One part of the first question gives the total price of the purchase rather than the original price of the car. If
  students use the given value as an original price, ask them to double-check the given information.</p>
<p>In the last question, students may struggle to represent&nbsp;\( r \)%&nbsp;algebraically. Some students may multiply
  the price by&nbsp;\( r \), and others may write&nbsp;\( 0.0r \). Urge students to look at their work in the first
  question. Ask them: &ldquo;By what number did you multiply the car price? What operation turns the number 6 into
  0.06?&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students whose equations are equivalent but in different forms to share their responses. Record and display
  them for all to see. Then, draw students&rsquo; attention to the first and last equation in each question.</p>
<p>For the first question, the equations might be:&nbsp;\( T=9,\!500 + 0.06(9,\!500) + 120 \)&nbsp;and&nbsp;\(T=p+0.06p+ 120 \). Ask students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;In the first equation, what quantities do we know?&rdquo; (the original price of the car, the tax rate, and
    the miscellaneous charges) &ldquo;When might it be useful to write an equation like this?&rdquo; (when we know all
    relevant quantities except for one)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;In the other equation, what quantities do we know?&rdquo; (the tax rate and the miscellaneous charges)
    &ldquo;When might it be useful to write an equation like this?&rdquo; (when we want to have a kind of formula for
    finding the total price for a car of any price, assuming the tax rate and miscellaneous charges are fixed at 6%
    and&nbsp;$120, respectively)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the second question, the equations might be:&nbsp;\( T=9,\!500+\frac{r}{100}(9,\!500)+m \)&nbsp;and&nbsp;\(
  T=p+\frac{r}{100} (p)+m \). Ask students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;In the first equation, what quantities do we know?&rdquo; (the original price of the car) &ldquo;When might
    it be useful to write an equation like this?&rdquo; (when we want to know the total cost of a&nbsp;$9,500 car but
    don&rsquo;t know the tax rate or other fees)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;In the other equation, what quantities do we know?&rdquo; (none) &ldquo;Why might it be helpful to write an
    equation like this?&rdquo; (It helps us see the relationship of all the quantities that are relevant in the
    situation. It is flexible in that it can be used to find the total cost for any car price, tax rate, and
    miscellaneous charges.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Emphasize that we might choose to use letters to represent quantities that vary or those that are constant, depending
  on what we want to understand or know.</p>

<h4>Writing an Equation to Represent a Real-World
  Problem with Percentages</h4>
<p>The steps for writing an equation to represent a
  real-world scenario with percentages are the same as before. Just be sure to change the given
  percent to a decimal before you use it in the equation.</p>
<div class="os-raise-graybox">
  <p class="os-raise-text-bold os-raise-text-center">Writing an Equation</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1 - Read </strong>the problem.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2 - Identify</strong> the variables and known values. If needed, sketch a picture of the scenario.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3 - Write </strong>a sentence using the relationship among the values.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4 - Translate </strong>the sentence into an equation.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>For example, what is an equation that can represent this scenario?</p>
<p> The label on Audrey&rsquo;s yogurt said that one serving provided 12 grams of protein, which is 24% of the
  recommended daily amount. What is the total recommended daily amount of protein?</p>
<br>
<p>
  Here&rsquo;s how to use the steps:
</p> <br>
<p><strong>Step 1 - Read </strong>the problem.</p>
<p>The label on Audrey's yogurt said that one serving provided 12 grams of protein, which is 24% of the recommended
  daily amount. What is the total recommended daily amount of protein? </p>
<p><strong>Step 2 - Identify</strong> the variables and known values. If needed, sketch a picture of the scenario. <br>
</p>
<p>
  1 serving = 12 grams of protein<br>
  1 serving is 24% of recommended daily amount
</p>
<p>Let&nbsp;\( a \) = total amount of protein (in grams).<br></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 - Write</strong> a sentence using the relationship among the values.<br></p>
<p>12 grams is 24% of the total amount</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 - Translate</strong> the sentence into an equation.<br></p>
<p>\( 12 = 0.24a \)<br></p>
