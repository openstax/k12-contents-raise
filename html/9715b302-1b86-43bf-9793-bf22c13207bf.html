<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students use graphing technology to experiment with the linear term in quadratic expressions of the form \(ax^2+bx\), where \(a\) is either positive and negative. They notice that adding a linear term to \(x^2\) or \(-x^2\) shifts the graph both horizontally and vertically.</p>
<p>One way to quantify the shift of a graph is in terms of the \(x\)-intercepts and the vertex. For example, the graph of \(y=x^2\) has an \(x\)-intercept at \((0,0)\). Adding \(20x\) to \(x^2\) shifts the graph to the left and down such that the \(x\)-intercepts are now at \((-20,0)\) and \((0,0)\). The shift also moves the vertex of the graph from \((0,0)\) to \((-10,-100)\). Students make sense of the values of these \(x\)-intercepts by recognizing that \(x^2+20x\) is equivalent to \(x(x+20)\), and that \(x\) values of 0 and -20 give the expression a value of 0.</p>
<p>Students then use their observations to predict the \(x\)-intercepts and vertices of the graphs of several equations without graphing. They also notice that when a quadratic expression has no linear term but has a constant term, rewriting it in factored form gets tricky, and that the graph may or may not have \(x\)-intercepts. (For now they are just making this observation. In a later unit, they will explore why this is the case.)</p>
<p>As they change the parameters of an expression on the graph, study the effects on the graph, and articulate their observations, students practice looking for and describing regularity through repeated reasoning.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Students may be tempted to solve these problems using Desmos or another technology as they did in the previous section. Remind students the purpose of this unit is writing quadratic equations from real solutions without graphing.</p>

<h4>Student Activity </h4>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Use the graphing tool or technology outside the course. Graph \(y=x^2\), and then experiment with adding different linear terms (for example, \(x^2+4x\), \(x^2+20x\), \(x^2-50x\)). Record your observations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The graph still looks like a quadratic function when adding a linear term but it "shifts" both horizontally and vertically. Adding a positive multiple of \(x\) to \(x^2\) shifts it down and to the left while adding a negative multiple of \(x\) shifts it down and to the right.</p>
<p>Use your observations from question 1 to answer questions 2&ndash;5 and complete the table.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Students have already used factoring to help find the \(x\)-intercepts of a parabola. From the factorization of a quadratic, it is only one additional step to finding the real solutions of the equation. In this lesson, students will be working backward from real solutions to write a quadratic equation. Pointing out that they have already done this process in reverse may help some students.</p>

<p>Without more information or a graph, we don&rsquo;t discuss whether the associated parabola opens up or down, but this information could be added to an extension of the lesson where warranted.</p>

<p>Similarly, this lesson doesn&rsquo;t take into account a particular \(y\)-intercept. To extend this lesson, you could point out that any quadratic of the form \(y=a(x-x\)<sub>1</sub>\()(x-x\)<sub>2</sub>\()\), where x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> are the real roots, will be a quadratic that meets the requirements. Then, they can plug in (0, y) for the \(y\)-intercept, or even any known point on the parabola to find the particular value for \(a\) that fits the additional point.</p>

<h4>Quadratics Without Linear Terms</h4>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Find the \(x\)-intercepts and the vertex for \(f(x)=x^2-4\).</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Write the function in factored form. Use difference of squares:</p>
<p>\(f(x)=x^2-4=(x-2)(x+2)\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Set each factor equal to 0.</p>
<p>\(x - 2 = 0\)<br>
  \(x = 2\)</p>
<p>\(x + 2 = 0\)<br>
  \(x = -2\)</p>
<p>The \(x\)-intercepts are \((2, 0)\) and \((-2, 0)\).</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Find the \(x\)-value in the middle of the two \(x\)-intercepts.
  This occurs at \(x = 0\). This is the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex.</p>
<p> To find the point at the vertex, substitute into the function:<br>
  \(f(0)=0^2-4=-4\)</p>
<p>Vertex: \((0, -4)\)</p>
<h4>Try It: Quadratics Without Linear Terms</h4>
<p>Find the \(x\)-intercepts and the vertex for \(f(x)=x^2-64\).</p>
<p>Write down your answers, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to find the \(x\)-intercepts and vertex of \(f(x)=x^2-64\):</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Write the function in factored form:<br>
  \(f(x)=x^2-64=(x-8)(x+8)\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Set each factor equal to 0.<br>
  \(x - 8 = 0\)<br>
  \(x = 8\)</p>
<p>\(x + 8 = 0\)<br>
  \(x = -8\)</p>
<p>The \(x\)-intercepts are at \((8, 0)\) and \((-8, 0)\).</p>
<p>The vertex is located halfway between the \(x\)-intercepts, at \(x = 0\).</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  To find the point, substitute into \(f(x)=x^2-64\).</p>
<p>\(f(0)=0^2-64=-64\)</p>
<p>The vertex is at \((0, -64)\).</p>
