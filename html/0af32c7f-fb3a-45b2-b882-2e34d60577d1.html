<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> Explain why dividing by a variable to solve a quadratic equation is not a good strategy. </li>
<li> Explain why quadratic equations can have no solutions and explain why there are none. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> 8.5.1: Reviewing Zero Product Property </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you reviewed how the zero product property allows you to find solutions to quadratic equations in which an expression of factors is set equal to 0. </li>
</ul>
<li> 8.5.2: Interpreting Graphs to Solve Quadratic Equations </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you learned how to use technology to graph quadratic equations and interpret those graphs to find solutions. </li>
<li> 8.5.2: Self Check </li>
<li> 8.5.2: Additional Resources </li>
</ul>
<li> 8.5.3: Choosing an Effective Strategy to Solve Quadratic Equations </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you practiced solving quadratic equations without any outside context about the best strategy to use. </li>
<li> 8.5.3: Self Check </li>
<li> 8.5.3: Additional Resources </li>
</ul>
<li> 8.5.4: Analyzing Errors When Solving Quadratic Equations </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you learned to watch out for common errors made when solving quadratic equations. This includes not taking the square root of a negative number and accurately determining how many solutions an equation might have. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
