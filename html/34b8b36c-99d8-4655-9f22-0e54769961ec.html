<h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>
<div class="body">
  <p>A cardboard box, which weighs 0.6 pound when empty, is filled with 15 bags of beans and a 4-pound bag of rice. The total weight of the box and the contents inside it is 25.6 pounds. One way to represent this situation is with the equation <span class="math math-repaired">\( 0.6 + 15b + 4 = 25.6 \)</span>.</p>
  <span>1. In this situation, what does the solution to the equation represent?</span><br><span><br></span>
</div>
<div class="body"><span>2. Select all equations that are equivalent to </span><span class="math math-repaired">\( 0.6 + 15b + 4=25.6 \)</span><span>.</span></div>

  <ul>
    <li><span>Equation A: </span><span class="math math-repaired">\( 15b + 4 = 25.6 \)</span></li>

  <h3>Response to Student Thinking</h3>
</div>
<div class="body">If the majority of students struggle with this cool-down, consider building in 3 minutes to the launch of Activity 7.2. If students struggled to find all of the equivalent equations, consider showing the equations as a sequence&mdash;the original equation, followed by Equation B, followed by Equation E&mdash;and asking, &ldquo;How do we know these are equivalent?&rdquo; Or consider showing the original equation with Equation C directly underneath. If multiple students identified incorrect equations as equivalent, you might consider showing the original equation with Equation A or D directly underneath and asking &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Did the same thing happen to both sides?&rdquo;<br><br></div>
<div class="body">If only a few students struggle with this cool-down, then those are the students to support during Activity 1.7.2 and to pay careful attention to during the synthesis for 1.7.2.</div>
