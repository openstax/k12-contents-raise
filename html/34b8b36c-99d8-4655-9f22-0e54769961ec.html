<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Give students continued access to calculators.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>A cardboard box, which weighs 0.6 pound when empty, is filled with 15 bags of beans and a 4-pound bag of rice. The
  total weight of the box and the contents inside it is 25.6 pounds. One way to represent this situation is with the
  equation \( 0.6 + 15b + 4 = 25.6 \).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>In this situation, what does the solution to the equation represent?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The weight, in pounds, of one bag of beans</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>Identify the <strong>three</strong> equations that are equivalent to \( 0.6 + 15b + 4=25.6 \).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>\( 15b + 4 = 25.6 \)</li>
  <li>\( 15b + 4 = 25 \)</li>
  <li>\( 3(0.6 + 15b + 4) = 76.8 \)</li>
  <li>\( 15b = 25.6 \)</li>
  <li> \( 15b = 21 \)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The correct answers are B, C, E. Correctly applying the properties of real numbers and using
  inverse operations helps you recognize equivalent equations.</p>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<p>If the majority of students struggle with this cool down, consider building in three minutes to the launch of
  Activity 1.7.2 to revisit this topic. If students struggled to find all of the equivalent equations, consider:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Showing the equations as a sequence—the original equation, followed by Equation B, followed by Equation E—and asking, “How do we know these are equivalent?” 
    </li>
    <li>Or, consider showing the original equation with Equation C directly underneath. 
    </li>
    <li>If multiple students identified incorrect equations as equivalent, you might consider showing the original equation with Equation A or D directly underneath and asking “What happened?” or “Did the same thing happen to both sides?”
    </li>
  </ul>
<p>If only a few students struggle with this cool down, then those are the students to support during Activity 1.7.2 and to pay careful attention to during the synthesis for 1.7.2.
