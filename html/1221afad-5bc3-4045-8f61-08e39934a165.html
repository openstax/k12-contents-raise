<p>Some key takeaways from this lesson are the properties used to simplify the different exponential expressions.</p>
<p>To help students see remember these properties, review the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li> Exponential expressions can be represented using repeated multiplication. </li>
<li> The Product Property for Exponents is used when you are multiplying exponential terms with the same base. To simplify, the exponential terms are added and the same base is kept. </li>
<li> The Quotient Property for Exponents is used when you are dividing exponential terms with the same base. To simplify, the exponential terms are subtracted and the same base is kept. </li>
<li> The Zero Exponent Property states that any non-zero number raised to the zero power is 1. </li>
<li> The Properties of Negative Exponents state that when simplifying a term with a negative exponent, the reciprocal of the base is used and the sign of the exponent is flipped. </li>
<li> The Quotient to a Negative Power Property is used to simplify values being divided while all raised to a negative exponent. First, the expression is rewritten using the Properties of Negative Exponents to find its equivalent using non-negative exponents. Then the exponent is distributed to the dividend and the divisor so that each is raised to the same power. </li>
<li> The Power Property for Exponents states that to simplify an expression with equivalent bases in which a power is raised to a power, the exponents are multiplied. </li>
<li> The Product to a Power Property for Exponents states that when you raise products to a power, all factors being multiplied are raised to that power. </li>
<li> The Quotient to a Power Property for Exponents states that when you raise a divisor and dividend to a power, both are raised to that power. </li>
</ul>
