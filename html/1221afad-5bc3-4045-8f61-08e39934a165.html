<p>Some key takeaways from this lesson are the properties used to simplify the different exponential expressions.</p>
<p>To help students see remember these properties, review the following points:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Exponential expressions can be represented using repeated multiplication. </li>
  <li> The Product Property for Exponents is used when you are multiplying exponential terms with the same base. To simplify, the exponential terms are added and the same base is kept. </li>
  <li> The Quotient Property for Exponents is used when you are dividing exponential terms with the same base. To simplify, the exponential terms are subtracted and the same base is kept. </li>
  <li> The Zero Exponent Property states that any non-zero number raised to the zero power is 1. </li>
  <li> The Properties of Negative Exponents state that when simplifying a term with a negative exponent, the reciprocal of the base is used and the sign of the exponent is flipped. </li>
  <li> The Quotient to a Negative Power Property is used to simplify values being divided while all raised to a negative exponent. First, the expression is rewritten using the Properties of Negative Exponents to find its equivalent using non-negative exponents. Then the exponent is distributed to the dividend and the divisor so that each is raised to the same power. </li>
  <li> The Power Property for Exponents states that to simplify an expression with equivalent bases in which a power is raised to a power, the exponents are multiplied. </li>
  <li> The Product to a Power Property for Exponents states that when you raise products to a power, all factors being multiplied are raised to that power. </li>
  <li> The Quotient to a Power Property for Exponents states that when you raise a divisor and dividend to a power, both are raised to that power. </li>
</ul>
<p>If needed, review the chart in the last activity as a class to review the rules.</p>
<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
