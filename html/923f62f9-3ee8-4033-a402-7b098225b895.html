<p>In this lesson, you will use graphs to learn about the domain of functions. You will examine and interpret different types of graphs that represent real-world situations to determine the domain and range.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Determine a reasonable domain and range for the function when given a description of a function in a situation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the<strong> activities </strong>that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 4.13.1: Different Features of a Graph </li>
  <li> 4.13.2: Graphs of Functions </li>
  <ul>
    <li> 4.13.2: Self Check </li>
    <li> 4.13.2: Additional Resources </li>
