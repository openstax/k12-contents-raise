<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students use the insights from the previous activity to write equivalent quadratic expressions in standard form and factored form. They see that when a quadratic expression in standard form is a difference of two squares (a squared variable, \(x^2\), and a squared constant, \(m^2\)) and has no linear term, the factored form is \((x + m)(x &minus; m)\). Even if the constant term is not a perfect square, we can still find the factored form, but the numbers in the factors would not be rational numbers. For example, the expression \(x^2&minus;12\) can be written as \((x + \sqrt{12})(x &minus; \sqrt{12})\) because \(\sqrt{12} \cdot -\sqrt{12} = -12\). If we expand \((x + \sqrt{12})(x &minus; \sqrt{12})\), there will be no linear term because \(\sqrt{12}x + (-\sqrt{12}x) = 0\).</p>
<p>Students also notice that when a quadratic expression is a sum (instead of a difference) of a squared variable and a squared constant, it cannot be written in factored form.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Consider arranging students in groups of two and asking them to think quietly about the problems before discussing their responses with their partner.</p>
<p>Ask students to write as many equivalent expressions as time permits while aiming to complete at least the first six rows and the last row of the table.</p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may struggle to see the numbers in the expressions in standard form as perfect squares. Prompt them to create a list or table of square numbers (\(1^2=1\), \(2^2=4\), \(3^2=9\), and so on) to have as a handy reference. Others may benefit by rewriting both terms as squares before writing the factored form. Demonstrate how to rewrite \(49x^2- 81\) as \((7x)^2-(9)^2\) and \(\frac {1}{4}x^2-25\) as \((\frac {1}{2}x)^2- (5)^2\).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Consider displaying the incomplete table for all to see and asking students to record their responses. Give the class time to examine the responses and to bring up any disagreements or questions. Discuss with students:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>"How can we check if the expression in factored form is indeed equivalent to the given expression in standard form?" (We can expand the factored expression by applying the distributive property and see if it gives the expression in standard form.) </li>
  <li>"Some of the expressions show a squared variable subtracted from a number, instead of the other way around. Can we still write an equivalent expression in factored form?" (Yes. As long as the expression in standard form can be written as a difference of two squares, it can be written in factored form.) </li>
  <li>"What if the number is not a perfect square, for example, \(x^2&minus;5\)?" (We can still write it in factored form, by thinking about what number can be squared to get 5. Both \(\sqrt{5}\) and \(-\sqrt{5}\) can be squared to get 5. Regardless of which number we use, the factored form is
    \((x + \sqrt{5})(x &minus; \sqrt{5})\)). </li>
  <li>"Why can \(x^2&minus;100\) be written in factored form but \(x^2+100\) cannot?" (One possible approach is to rewrite the former as \(x^2+0x &minus;100\). We learned previously that, to write this expression in factored form, we would need to look for two numbers whose product is &ndash;100 and whose sum is 0. The numbers 10 and &ndash;10 meet this requirement. For \(x^2+0x +100\), however, we need two numbers whose product is 100 and whose sum is 0. No such numbers exist. To have a sum of 0, one number has to be positive and the other negative, so their product can&rsquo;t be positive 100.) </li>

<h4>Factoring Quadratic Equations Without a Linear Term</h4>
<p>We can use what we have learned in the previous lesson to write quadratic equations of a special form into factored form.</p>
<p>Particularly, we can rewrite:</p>
<p>\(x^2&minus; c^2\) into \((x + c)(x &minus; c)\).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example.</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 1
</p>
<p>Write \(v^2&minus;36\) in factored form.</p>
<p>We know that the form we are looking for is \((v\;&minus;\) __ \()(v \;+\) __ \()\).</p>
<p>Since we know the square <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">root</span> of \(v^2\) is \(v\) and the square root of 36 is 6, the factored form is \((v &minus; 6)(v + 6)\).</p>
<p>We can multiply to check our work.</p>
<p>\((v &minus; 6)(v + 6)\)<br>
  \(\begin{array}{rcl}&amp;&amp;{=v^2+6v-6v-36\\=v^2-36\; {\style{color:red}\checkmark}}\\&amp;&amp;\end{array}\)</p>
<p>The process is similar when there is a coefficient on the squared term.</p>
<p>\(a^2x^2&minus;c^2\;\;\;\;\) factors into \(\;\;\;\;(ax + c)(ax &minus; c)\)</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at another example to understand the process.</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 2</p>
<p>Write \(16m^2&minus; 81\) in factored form.</p>
<p>The form we are looking for now is ( __ &minus; __ )( __ + __ ).</p>
<p>Taking the square root of the first term gives us \(4m\).</p>
<p>So, we have \((4m \;&minus;\) __ \()(4m \;+\) __ \()\).</p>
<p>Now, we are in the same place as in the previous example. The square root of 81 is 9.</p>
<p>So, the factored form is \((4m &minus; 9 )(4m + 9)\).</p>
<p>Again, we can multiply to check.</p>
<p>\((4m &minus; 9)(4m + 9)\)<br>
  \(\begin{array}{rcl}&amp;&amp;{= 4m^2 + 36m &minus; 36m &minus; 81\\= 4m^2 &minus; 81\; {\style{color:red}\checkmark}}\\&amp;&amp;\end{array}\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 3</p>
<p>As we see in the activity, where the variable is located is not important as long as the quadratic binomial is still the difference of two squares.</p>
<p>Write \(64 &minus; 9b^2\) in factored form.</p>
<p>We use the same concept to find the factored form.</p>
<p>\(64 &minus; 9b^2= (8 &minus; 3b)(8 + 3b)\)</p>
<p>We can multiply to check.</p>
<p>\((8 &minus; 3b)(8 + 3b)\)<br>
  \(\begin{array}{rcl}&amp;&amp;{= 64 + 24b &minus; 24b &minus; 9b^2\\= 64 &minus; 9b^2\; {\style{color:red}\checkmark}}\\&amp;&amp;\end{array}\)</p>
<p>Remember that any expression of the form \(x^2 + c\) or \(ax^2+ c\) does not have a factored form!</p>
<ul>
  <li> For \(x^2+ c\), the \(c\) is not squared, and the terms are not being subtracted. </li>
  <li> For \(ax^2+ c\), neither the \(a\) nor the \(c\) is a perfect square, and the terms are not being subtracted. </li>
