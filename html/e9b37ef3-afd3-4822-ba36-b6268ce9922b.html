<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm-up refreshes and reviews all the factoring strategies learned in this unit. Students will remember that each strategy is useful for a specific type of polynomial. In this activity, they will work in pairs to recall the ideal type of polynomial for each strategy learned so far.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Have each pair of students complete the activity questions together.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">

</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Factoring by finding the GCF of an expression and using reverse distribution</li>
  <li>Factoring using grouping</li>

  <li>Factoring trinomials of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\) using trial and error</li>
  <li>Factoring trinomials using the &ldquo;\(ac\)&rdquo; method</li>
  <li>Factoring using substitution</li>
  <li>Factoring the difference of squares</li>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Ask students:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Are there any strategies that you are not sure when to use? Address their questions in regard to when to use any strategies mentioned. </li>
  <li> Do you have a favorite strategy? Explain. (Sample answer: the &ldquo;\(ac\)&rdquo; method because it works on any trinomial of the form \(ax^2 + bx +c\).) </li>
  <li> Do you have a least favorite strategy? Explain. </li>
</ul>
