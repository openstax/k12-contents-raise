<h4>Writing Expression from Patterns</h4>
<p>Find the number of dots in Step 5, and write an expression to find \(n\) number of dots.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Make a table to help you find the pattern. </p>
<table class="os-raise-midsizetable">
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col">
        Step number
      </th>
<th scope="col">
        Number of dots
      </th>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Notice that the start has 2 rows and 2 columns, or 4 dots.<br/>
  Each step adds a row of 2 dots, plus 1 more dot.<br/>
  So, each step adds 3 dots.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Continuing this linear pattern, Step 5 would have 19 dots. </p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - An expression could be \(3n+4\). <br/>
  This is a linear expression. </p>

<p>Each step has that number of dots squared, then doubled, and then one is added.</p>
<p>So, Step 5 would have 51 dots.</p>
<p>The expression would be \(2n^2+1\), where \(n\) is the step number.</p>
<p>This is a quadratic expression.</p>
