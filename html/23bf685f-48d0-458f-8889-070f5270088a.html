<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>The goal of this activity is to allow students to explore two growth patterns and to notice that a doubling pattern eventually grows very, very large, even with a small starting value. Students may perform a repeated calculation, or they may generalize the process by writing expressions or equations.</p>
<p>Making spreadsheet technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Provide access to calculators or spreadsheets. Present the situation (either by asking students to read it quietly or by performing a dramatic reading). Before students do any calculating or any other work, poll the class about which option they think is better. Display the results of the poll (the number of students who think Purse A is better and the number who think Purse B is better) for all to see.</p>
<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>

<p> Use this routine to support reading comprehension of this word problem. Use the first read to orient students to the situation. Ask students to describe what the situation is about without using numbers (as a reward, students make a choice between Purse A and Purse B). Use the second read to identify quantities and relationships. Ask students what can be counted or measured without focusing on the values. Listen for, and amplify, the important quantities that vary in relation to each other in this situation: the amount of money, in dollars, and the amount of time, in days. After the third read, invite students to brainstorm possible strategies to answer the questions. This helps students connect the language in the word problem and the reasoning needed to solve the problem.</p>

<h5> Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>
<div>
<p>Represent the same information through different modalities by using diagrams. Encourage students to sketch diagrams that show how the amount of money grows over the first few days. Students may benefit from this visual as they transition to the use of a table or other representation to track growth.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>You are walking along a beach, and your toe hits something hard. You reach down, grab onto a handle, and pull out a lamp! It is sandy. You start to brush it off with your towel. Poof! A genie appears.</p>
<p>He tells you, &ldquo;Thank you for freeing me from that bottle! I was getting claustrophobic. You can choose one of these purses as a reward.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li> Purse A, which contains $1,000 today. If you leave it alone, it will contain $1,200 tomorrow (by magic). The next day, it will be $1,400. This pattern of an additional $200 per day will continue. </li>
<li> Purse B, which contains 1 penny today. Leave that penny in there because tomorrow it will (magically) turn into 2 pennies. The next day, there will be 4 pennies. The amount in the purse will continue to double each day. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> How much money will be in Purse A after a 7-day week?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong> After 7 days, Purse A will contain $2,400 because it grows by $200 each day for 7 days.</li><br>
<li> How much money will be in Purse B after a 7-day week?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong> Purse B will contain $1.28. It doubles each day for 7 days, so it will have \(1 \cdot 2^7\) or 128 cents (the 1 here represents the 1 cent for when the genie appeared).</li><br>
<li> How much money will be in Purse A after two weeks?<br><br> <strong>Answer:</strong> After 2 weeks, Purse A will contain an additional $1,400 for a total of $3,800.</li><br>
<li> How much money will be in Purse B after two weeks?<br><br> <strong>Answer:</strong> After 2 weeks, Purse B will contain \(1 \cdot 2^{14}\) cents. This is 16,384 cents or $163.84. </li><br>
<li> The genie later adds that he will let the money in each purse grow for three weeks.</li><br>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
<li> How much money will be in Purse A in three weeks? <br><br><strong>Answer:</strong> Purse A will have an additional $1,400 during the third week for a total of $5,200.</li><br>
<li> How much money will be in Purse B in three weeks?<br><br> <strong>Answer:</strong> Purse B will have 128 times as much money (compared to the end of two weeks) for a total of $20,971.52.</li><br>
</ol>
<li> Which purse contains more money after 30 days?<br><br> <strong>Answer:</strong> Purse B will have a lot more money. Purse A will have \(1,000+30 \cdot 200\) or $7,000, which is much less than the doubling purse on day 21.</li><br>
</ol>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may confuse the units for the two purses. Remind them that Purse B contains pennies (and thus cents rather than dollars).</p>
<p>Vocabulary such as <em>claustrophobic</em> and <em>double</em> may need to be clarified so students are clear on what the question is asking.</p>
<p>Due to prior experience with genie stories, students may be suspicious of the offers. Ask them to show their mathematical reasoning, rather than basing their choice of purses on their suspicions or other considerations such as how to carry a purse containing over 2 million pennies.</p>
<h4> Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Focus the discussion on how students found the amounts of money in the two purses after many days. Invite students who performed recursive calculations and those who wrote expressions or equations to share. Record and display students&rsquo; reasoning for all to see. Seeing the repeated reasoning will support students&rsquo; generalization work later. For example, the amount in Purse A will be \(1,000+200\) for day 1, then \(1,000+200+200\) for day 2, \(1,000+200+200+200\) for day 3, and so on. Connect this to writing expressions like \(1,000+200 \cdot 3\) and \(1,000+200x\) where \(x\)&nbsp;represents the number of days since the genie appeared.</p>
<p>For Purse B, highlight the fact that after two days it contains \((1 \cdot 2) \cdot 2\) cents, which is \(2^2\) cents. After three days, it contains \((1 \cdot 2) \cdot 2 \cdot 2\) cents, which is \(2^3\) cents. (Here the day the genie appears is treated as day 0.) This is a good opportunity to emphasize the meaning of exponential notation. Exponential notation is particularly useful for expressing the amount in Purse B on day 30, which is \(2^{30}\)cents.</p>
<p>If no students use a spreadsheet, consider demonstrating how it might be helpful in performing calculations like these.</p>

<p>When determining growth, there are a few ways to check. When given a table, you could graph each, or you could check the rate of change. Linear functions have a constant rate of change, where consecutive terms have a common difference. The common difference is a value that is added to or subtracted from consecutive terms to find the next term. Exponential functions have a constant ratio or common multiplier. The constant ratio is a value that is multiplied or divided from consecutive terms to find the next term.</p>
<ul>
<li> Table A is linear and has a slope of 8 since the change in \(y\) is 8 and the change in \(x\) is 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
<li> Table B is also linear because the change in \(y\) is 16 and the change in \(x\) is 2 for a slope of 8.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
<li> Table C is an example of an exponential function. There is a common ratio instead of a common difference. Notice that each \(y\)-term is 4 times the previous term. Therefore, the common ratio is 4. </li>
<li> Table D is also linear with a common difference of 4. </li>
</ul>
<p>Table C is the only exponential function. Therefore, it has a different growth pattern since Tables A, B, and D are linear.</p>

<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5> Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to determine the type of growth:&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you look at the \(y\)-values in the table, you notice that they are all 0.5 more than the previous term. That means there is a common difference of 0.5 and the function is linear.</p>
