<p>Description 1 best matches part C of the graph. If half of the workers went on strike, then the number of smartphones produced would be less than normal. The rate of change for C is less than the rate of change for A. </p>

<p>Description 3 best matches part B of the graph. If no smartphones are shipped to the sore, the total number remains constant during that time. </p>

<p>Part A of the graph best matches description 2. If the production schedule is normal, the rate of change of interval A is greater than the rate of change of interval C. </p>

  <p>Jameson was sick and did not work for almost a whole week. Then, he mowed several lawns over the next few days and deposited the money into his account after each job. It rained several days, so instead of working, Jameson withdrew money from his account each day to go to the movies and out to lunch with friends. </p>
