<p>Emphasize the point that rewriting quadratic expressions in factored form is not always an efficient or effective way to find solutions to quadratic equations. If time permits, consider generalizing the relationship between \(ax^2+ bx + c\) and its factored form to help students see why it can be a rather tricky process:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> We need to find two factors of \(a\). Let's call them \(p\) and \(q\). </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> We need to find two factors of \(c\). Let's call them \(m\) and \(n\). </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> The factored form can be written as \((px + m)(qx + n)\). </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> To see what \(p\), \(q\), \(m\), and \(n\) should be, we essentially have to apply the distributive property to the factors to get: \((px)(qx) + (np)x + (mq)x + mn\) or \((pq)x^2+ (np + mq)x + mn\). </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> We see that \(pq\) must multiply to make \(a\) and \(mn\) must multiply to make \(c\). </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> The challenge now is to find the right combination of \(p\) and \(q\) (factors of \(a\)) and \(m\) and \(n\) (factors of \(c\)) such that \(np + mq\) is equal to \(b\). </li>
</ul>
<p>Highlight that for some quadratic expressions, the right pairs of factors might be easily spotted, but for others, the process of guessing and checking can get pretty cumbersome, especially if \(a\) and \(c\) have many pairs of factors. There is also no guarantee that we will find a combination that works because some expressions do not have rational solutions (so we cannot find factors with rational numbers). This means that if we rely on putting an expression in factored form to solve an equation, we may get stuck. If we rely on graphing, the solutions may not be exact. We need another way!</p>
<p>Tell students that in upcoming lessons we will look at other techniques that allow us to solve without rewriting expressions in factored form.</p>
