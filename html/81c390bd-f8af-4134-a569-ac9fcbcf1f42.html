<p dir="ltr">In this lesson, you will experiment with expressions and equations to model a situation: planning a pizza party. For instance, what are the relevant quantities when planning for a pizza party? Are these quantities fixed or do they vary? How they might relate to one another? Are there any limitations or constraints on how much pizza should be ordered?</p>
<p dir="ltr">When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<ul>
  <li>Tell which quantities in a situation can vary and which ones cannot.</li>
  <li>Explain the meaning of the term &ldquo;constraint.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Use letters and numbers to write expressions representing the quantities in a situation.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
