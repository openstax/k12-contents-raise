<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>Solving an equation with the quadratic formula involves multiple calculations, some of which may be prone to error.
  This activity acquaints students with some of the commonly made mistakes and encourages them to write and evaluate
  expressions carefully. As students analyze the progression of reasoning in worked solutions, they practice reasoning
  abstractly and attending to precision in communicating a solution.</p>
<p>As students work, identify those who can clearly and correctly explain the errors in the worked solutions. Ask them
  to share their responses during the class discussion.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Give students a few minutes of quiet work time to solve one to two equations using
  the quadratic formula, and then a moment to discuss their response with their partner. Then, ask them to study the
  worked solutions (in the activity statement) for the same equations that they had solved and identify the errors.</p>
<p>If time permits, ask groups to identify the errors in the remaining equations. If they get stuck, suggest that they
  try solving the equations first and then look for the errors.</p>
<p>Provide access to calculators for numerical computations.</p>

    <p>Use this routine to support whole-class discussion. After each student shares what they identified and explained as the error in the worked solutions, ask students to restate what they heard using precise mathematical language. Provide students with time to restate what they hear to a partner before selecting one or two students to share with the class. Ask the original speaker if their peer was accurately able to restate their thinking. Call studentsâ€™ attention to any words or phrases that helped to clarify the original statement. This provides more students with an opportunity to produce language as they interpret the reasoning of others.</p>

    <p>Use color coding and annotations to highlight connections between representations in a problem. For example, as students share their thinking, display their work and the worked solutions (with errors) side by side for all to see. When the students identify the error, use a highlighter to indicate the spot where the error was initially made, and highlight the corresponding spot in the correct example. Encourage students to do the same on their own materials. Before having students classify errors, invite students to suggest a list of possible types of errors and display the list. As students connect the types of errors to the example, annotate the worked examples and label them as such.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Display the worked solutions in the activity statement for all to see. Select previously identified students to
  identify and explain the error(s) in each worked solution.</p>
<p>After each student presents, ask the class to classify the error(s) by type and to explain their classification. For
  instance, are the errors careless mistakes or computational mistakes? Do they show gaps in understanding, incomplete
  communication, or a lack of precision?</p>
<p>If not mentioned by students, point out that these errors are easy to make but not always easy to notice. Sometimes,
  unless the solutions really make no sense, we won't know if the solutions are actually correct or completely off
  unless we check them. Tell students that they will consider ways to check their solutions in the next activity.</p>

<h4>Common Errors When Using the Quadratic Formula</h4>
<p>The quadratic formula has many parts in it. A small error in any one part can lead to incorrect solutions.</p>
<p>Suppose we are solving \(2x^2&minus;6=11x\). To use the formula, let's rewrite it in the form of \(ax^2+bx+c=0\),
  which gives: \(2x^2&minus;11x&minus;6=0\).</p>
<p>Here are some common errors to avoid:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Using the wrong values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the formula. </li>
</ul>
<p>\(x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2- 4ac}}{2a}\)</p>
<p>\(x=\frac{-11 \pm \sqrt{(11)^2- 4(2)(-6)}}{2(2)}\)</p>
<p>This is incorrect! \(b\) is -11, so \(-b\) is -(-11), which is 11, not -11.</p>
<p>The correct formula is:<br>
  \(x=\frac{11 \pm \sqrt{(11)^2- 4(2)(-6)}}{2(2)}\)</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Forgetting to multiply 2 by \(a\) for the denominator in the formula. </li>
</ul>
<p>\(x=\frac{11 \pm \sqrt{(11)^2- 4(2)(-6)}}{2}\)</p>
<p>This is incorrect! The denominator is \(2a\), which is \(2(2)\) or 4.</p>
<p>The correct formula is:<br>
  \(x=\frac{11 \pm \sqrt{(11)^2- 4(2)(-6)}}{2(2)}\)</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Forgetting that squaring a negative number produces a positive number. </li>
</ul>
<p>\(x=\frac{11 \pm \sqrt{-121- 4(2)(-6)}}{4}\)</p>
<p>This is incorrect! \((-11)^2\) is 121, not -121.</p>
<p>The correct formula is:<br>
  \(x=\frac{11 \pm \sqrt{121- 4(2)(-6)}}{4}\)</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Forgetting that a negative number times a positive number is a negative number. </li>
</ul>
<p>\(x=\frac{11 \pm \sqrt{121- 48}}{4}\)</p>
<p>This is incorrect! \(4(2)(-6)=-48\) and \(121&minus;(-48)\) is \(121+48\).</p>
<p>The correct formula is:<br>
  \(x=\frac {11 \pm \sqrt{121+48}}{4}\)</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Making calculation errors or not following the properties of algebra. </li>
</ul>
<p>\(x=\frac {11 \pm \sqrt{169}}{4}\)</p>
<p>\(x=11 \pm \sqrt{42.25}\)</p>
<p>This is incorrect! Both parts of the numerator, the 11 and the \(\sqrt{169}\), get divided by 4. Also,
  \(\frac{\sqrt{169}}{4}\) is not \(\sqrt{42.25}\).</p>
<p>The correct formula is:<br>
  \(x=\frac{11 \pm 13}{4}\)</p>
<p>Let's finish by evaluating \(\frac{11 \pm 13}{4}\) correctly:<br>
  \(x=\frac{11+13}{4}\) or \(x=\frac{11-13}{4}\)<br>
  \(x=\frac{24}{4}\) or \(x=-\frac{2}{4}\)<br>
  \(x=6\) or \(x=-\frac{1}{2}\)</p>
<p>To make sure our solutions are indeed correct, we can substitute the solutions back into the original equations and
  see whether each solution keeps the equation true.</p>
<p>Checking 6 as a solution:<br>
  \(2x^2-6=11x\)<br>
  \(2(6)^2-6=11(6)\)<br>
  \(2(36)-6=66\)<br>
  \(72-6=66\)<br>
  \(66=66 \; \checkmark\)</p>
<p>Checking \(-\frac{1}{2}\) as a solution:<br>
  \(2x^2-6=11x\)<br>
  \(2(-\frac{1}{2})^2-6=11(-\frac{1}{2})\)<br>
  \(2(\frac{1}{4})-6=-\frac{11}{2}\)<br>
  \(\frac{1}{2}-6=-5\frac{1}{2}\)<br>
  \(-5\frac{1}{2}=-5\frac{1}{2} \; \checkmark\)</p>
<p>We can also graph the equation \(y=2x^2&minus;11x&minus;6\) and find its \(x\)-intercepts to see whether our
  solutions to \(2x^2&minus;11x&minus;6=0\) are accurate (or close to accurate).</p>

<h4>Try It: Common Errors When Using the Quadratic Formula</h4>
<p>Zariah was solving the equation \(3x^2-8x+4=0\) with the quadratic formula and used the steps below. She then had to
  stop because she realized there was a problem. Locate and describe her error.</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  \(x=\frac{-(-8) \pm \sqrt{-8^2-4(3)(4)}}{6}\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  \(x=\frac{8 \pm \sqrt{-64-48}}{6}\)</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to find the error:</p>
<p>First, Zariah substituted \(a=3\), \(b= -8\), and \(c =4\) into the formula in Step 1.</p>
<p>However, under the radical, \(b^2=(-8)^2= + 64\).</p>
<p>Step 2 would then become:</p>
<p>\(x=\frac{8 \pm \sqrt{64-48}}{6}\)</p>
<p> Which leads to the following solution:</p>
<p>\(x=\frac{8 \pm \sqrt{16}}{6}\)</p>
<p>\(x=\frac{8 \pm 4}{6}\)</p>
<p>\(x=\frac{12}{6}=2\), \(x=\frac{4}{6}=\frac{2}{3}\)</p>
