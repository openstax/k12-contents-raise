<p>To help students generalize their reasoning and attend more closely to the structure of quadratic equations, consider revisiting the equations from the lesson and prompting students to articulate what the equations might reveal about the solutions. For example:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Display the equations from the warm up activity. Ask students if they can tell (without referring to the solutions they found earlier and without solving again) if an equation would have zero, one, or two solutions. </li>
  <li> Display a mix of equations from the second and third activities. Ask students if they can tell (without referring to the solutions they found earlier) which equations will have two solutions that are opposites (such as 5 and &ndash;5) and which will have two solutions that are not opposites (such as 3 and 7). Ask students to explain their thinking. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
