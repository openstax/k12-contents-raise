<h4>Reading Graphs of Quadratics</h4>
<p>An object is thrown upward from a height of 5 feet with a velocity of 60 feet per second. Its height, \(h(t)\), in feet after \(t\) seconds is modeled by the function \(h(t)=5+60t-16t^2\).</p>
<p><img alt="A parabola on a coordinate grid. The x-axis represents the time in seconds and the y-axis represents the distance above the ground in feet. The x-axis scale is 0.5 and extends from 0 to 4.5. The y-axis scale is 20 and extends from 0 to 80." height="231" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/32a38b72c84f4afe7093510818605bcc7a9b6d4f" width="311"/></p>
<p><strong>Step 1 </strong> -Identify the starting height.<br/>
  5 feet </p>
<p><strong>Step 2 </strong> -Identify the maximum height by looking at the vertex or peak of the parabola.<br/>
  approximately 62 feet </p>
<p><strong>Step 3 </strong> -Identify when the object reaches its maximum by matching the maximum with its matching time from the \(x\)-axis.<br/>
  approximately 1.75 seconds </p>
<p><strong>Step 4 </strong> -When does the object hit the ground?Â <br/>
  Look at where the object has a height of 0 feet, or the zero of the function. This happens at approximately 3.75 seconds. Notice there would be another zero on the graph of the function to the left of \(x=0\), but that does not make sense in the problem because the object was thrown from 5 feet. </p>
