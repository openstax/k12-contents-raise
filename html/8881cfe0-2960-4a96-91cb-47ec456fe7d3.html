<h4>Reading Graphs of Quadratics</h4>
<p>An object is thrown upward from a height of 5 feet with a velocity of 60 feet per second. Its height, \(h(t)\), in feet after \(t\) seconds is modeled by the function \(h(t)=5+60t-16t^2\).</p>
<p><img alt="Graph of the quadratic function h(t)=5+60t&minus;16t2  on a coordinate plane, origin  O. Horizontal axis scale 0 to 4 by 1&rsquo;s, labeled &ldquo;time (seconds)&rdquo;. Vertical axis scale 0 to 80 by&nbsp;20&rsquo;s, labeled &ldquo;distance above ground (feet)&rdquo;. Some of the points of this function are (0 comma 5), (1 comma 49), to a maximum near (1 point 9 comma 61 point 2 5) then decreasing through (2 comma 61), (3 comma 41) and (3.8 comma 0)." height="231" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/im-ims-export/KaMw3hqcauLrZMY6cEpX6ez1" width="311"></p>
<p>Step 1<br>Identify the starting height.<br>
 5 feet </p>
<p>Step 2<br>Identify the maximum height by looking at the vertex or peak of the parabola.<br>
 approximately 62 feet </p>
<p>Step 3<br>Identify when the object reaches its maximum by matching the maximum with its matching time from the \(x\)-axis.<br>
 approximately 1.75 seconds </p>
<p>Step 4<br>When does the object hit the ground?&nbsp;<br>
 Look at where the object has a height of 0 feet, or the zero of the function. This happens at approximately 3.75 seconds. Notice there would be another zero on the graph of the function to the left of \(x=0\), but that does not make sense in the problem because the object was thrown from 5 feet. </p>
