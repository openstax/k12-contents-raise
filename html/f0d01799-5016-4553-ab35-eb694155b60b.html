<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>A <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">constraint</span> is something that limits what is possible or reasonable in a situation.</p>
<p>For example, one constraint in a pizza party might be the number of slices of pizza each person could have, \(s\). We can write \( s&lt;4 \) to say that each person gets fewer than 4 slices.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Look at the expressions you wrote when planning the pizza party earlier.<ol>
      <li>Choose an expression that uses one or more letters.</li>
      <li>For each letter, determine what values would be reasonable. (For instance, could the value be a non-whole number? A number greater than 50? A negative number? Exactly 2?)<br><br></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Write equations or inequalities that represent some constraints in your pizza party plan. If a quantity must be an exact value, use the = symbol. If it must be greater than or less than a certain value to be reasonable, use the \( &gt; \) or \( &lt; \) symbol.</li>

    <p>Your answers may vary, but some equations or inequalities that represent some constraints in your pizza party plan could include the following:</p>
    <p>\( c = 7.50 \)&nbsp;or&nbsp;\( c &gt; 7.50 \) and&nbsp;\( c &lt; 12 \)<br><span>\( p &gt; 11 \)</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>\( p &lt; 20 \)</span></p>
