<p>Students are not expected to internalize how to derive the quadratic formula by the end of the lesson. They should, however, understand that each part of the complicated expression can be traced back to a step in completing the square. In other words, they should recognize that the formula is not an isolated, opaque method that mysteriously produces solutions to quadratic equations.</p>
<p>Discuss with students:</p>
<ul>
  <li> "How has your understanding of the quadratic formula changed from the work in this lesson?" </li>
  <li> "A classmate who is absent today is not sure where the quadratic formula came from. What would you say to help them understand, in a nutshell, what the formula is all about?" </li>
  <li> "If the formula is connected to the steps of completing the square, why not just complete the square when we need to solve equations? Why do you think it is helpful to have a formula, even if it involves quite a few operations?" </li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
