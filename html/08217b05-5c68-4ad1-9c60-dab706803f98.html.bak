<h4>Cool Down Activity</h4>
<p>To raise money for after-school programs at an elementary school, a group of parents is holding a weekend of games in a community center. They charge $8 per person for entry into the event. The group would like to earn at least $600, after paying for the cost of renting the space, which is $40 an hour.</p>

<p class="os-raise-mb-0">Compared to a fixed mindset, a growth mindset encourages you to embrace challenges, sustain effort, and try new strategies. Of course, no one embodies only a growth or fixed mindset; we are all a mixture of the two, and we can learn to recognize what triggers a fixed versus growth mindset. The brain is like a muscle—something you can strengthen.</p>
<p>Think about your current sense of having a growth mindset. Are the following statements are true for you?</p>
<ul>
<li>
          I truly believe that people can change.
        </li>
<li>
          I can always change how intelligent I am.
        </li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t worry if none of these statements are true for you. Developing this trait takes time. Your first step starts today!</p>
