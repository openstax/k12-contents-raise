<h4><span>2.9.2: Additional Resources</h4>
<p><span><strong><em>The following content is available to students who would like more support based on their experience with the self check. Students will not automatically have access to this content, so you may wish to share it with those who could benefit from it.&nbsp;</em></strong><br></p>
<h4><span><span><span>Graphing Linear Inequalities</h4>
<p>What number would make the inequality \( x &gt; 3 \) true? Are you thinking, &ldquo;\(x\) could be four&rdquo;? That&rsquo;s correct, but \(x\) could be 6, too, or 37, or even 3.001. Any number greater than 3 is a solution to the inequality \( x &gt; 3 \). We show all the solutions to the inequality \(x &gt; 3\) on the number line by shading in all the numbers to the right of 3, to show that all numbers greater than 3 are solutions. Because the number 3 itself is not a solution, we put an open dot at 3.</p>
<p>We can also represent inequalities using interval notation. There is no upper end to the solution to this inequality. In interval notation, we express \( x &gt; 3 \) as \((3, &infin;)\). The symbol &infin; is read as &ldquo;infinity.&rdquo; It is not an actual number.</p>
<p>The figure below shows both the number line and the interval notation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\( x &gt; 3 \)</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="A number line is shown. There is an open circle on 3. The number line to the right of 3 is highlighted." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="36" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/1f11f9f52563f8687b96d97d1f8d166c69c5b4d7" width="300"><br><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\((3, &infin;)\)<br></p>
<p>We use the left parenthesis symbol, (, to show that the endpoint of the inequality is not included. The left bracket symbol, [, shows that the endpoint is included.</p>
<p>The inequality \(x&le;1\) means all numbers less than or equal to 1. Here we need to show that 1 is a solution, too. We do that by putting a bracket at \(x = 1\). We then shade in all the numbers to the left of 1, to show that all numbers less than 1 are solutions. See the figure below.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="A number line is shown. There is a closed circle on 1. The number line to the left of 1 is highlighted." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="36" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c89f24114c86a88a457ff1ee55c0119e4aea0a91" width="300"></p>
<p><span><span>There is no lower end to those numbers. We write \( x &le; 1 \) in interval notation as (&minus;&infin;,1]. The symbol &minus;&infin; is read as &ldquo;negative infinity.&rdquo; The figure below shows both the number line and interval notation.<br></p>
