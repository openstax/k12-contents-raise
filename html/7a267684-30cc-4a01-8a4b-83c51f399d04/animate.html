<p>In this lesson, you will write, solve, and graph linear inequalities in two variables. THIS IS AN EDIT</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Determine which side of the line the solutions to the inequality will fall, given a two-variable inequality and the graph of the related equation.</li>
  <li>Describe the graph that represents the solutions to a linear inequality in two variables.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals: </p>
<ul>
  <li>2.10.1: Using Computation and Reasoning</li>
  <li>2.10.2: Finding Solutions to Inequalities on the Coordinate Plane</li>
  <li>2.10.2: Self Check</li>
  <li>2.10.3: Sketching Solutions to Inequalities</li>
  <li>2.10.3: Self Check</li>
  <li>2.10.4: Shading Boundary Line Regions</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>. </p>
