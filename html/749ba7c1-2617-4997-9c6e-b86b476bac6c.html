<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students continue to explore how quadratic functions can model the movement of a falling object.
  They evaluate the function seen earlier \((d=16t^2)\) at a non-integer input, and then build a new function to
  represent the distance from the ground of a falling object \(t\) seconds after it is dropped. To find a new expression
  that describes the height of the object, students reason repeatedly about the height of the object at different times
  and look for regularity in their reasoning.</p>
<p>The number 576 is chosen as the height (in feet) from which the object is dropped to make it more apparent for
  students that the values in the two tables (distance fallen and distance from ground) record distances measured from
  opposite ends. (Any value of at a whole-number \(t\)&nbsp;<span>could work. In this case, \(t=6\) is selected.)</span>
</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two, and suggest that they check in with each other after trying each question. To
  facilitate peer discussion, consider displaying sentence stems or questions that students could use, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> &ldquo;Why do you think the object will have fallen that distance in 0.5 seconds?&rdquo; </li>
  <li> &ldquo;How do you think the values in the first table are changing? What about in the second table?&rdquo; </li>
  <li> &ldquo;How are the two tables alike? How are they different?&rdquo; </li>
</ul>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Galileo Galilei, an Italian scientist, and other medieval scholars studied the motion of free-falling objects. The
  law they discovered can be expressed by the equation \(d=16t^2\), which gives the distance fallen in feet as a
  function of time, \(t\), in seconds.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>To help students make sense of the two functions, compare and contrast their representations (tables, equations, and
  graphs) and discuss the connections between them. Ask questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> &ldquo;How did you complete the missing values in the first table?&rdquo; (Substituting 3 and 4 for \(t\) in
    \(16t^2\) gives the distances fallen after 3 and 4 seconds.) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;What about those in the second table?&rdquo; (The distance from the ground is 576 minus the distance
    fallen, so we can use the values for \(t=3\) and \(t=4\) from the first table to calculate the values in the second
    table.) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;Why do the values in the first table increase and those in the second table decrease?&rdquo; (The distance
    from the top of the building increases as the object falls farther and farther from it. The distance from the ground
    decreases as the object falls closer and closer to it.) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;The expression representing the distance fallen shows \(16t^2\), and the other shows \(576-16t^2\). Why is
    that?&rdquo; (In the first function, the distance fallen, measured from where the object is dropped, will always be
    positive. In the second function, what&rsquo;s measured is the height from the ground, so the distance fallen needs
    to be subtracted from the height of the building.) </li>
  <li> &ldquo;If we graph the two equations that represent distance fallen and distance from the ground over time, what
    would the graphs look like? Try sketching the graphs.&rdquo; </li>
</ul>
<p>Display graphs that represent the two functions and make sure students can interpret them. For example, they should
  see that the \(y\)-intercept of each graph corresponds to the starting value of each function before the object is
  dropped.</p>
<p>They should also notice that the difference in distance between successive seconds gets larger in both cases, hence
  the curving graphs. (If the differences were constant, the graphs would have been straight lines.)</p>

<p>Display the embedded applet for all to see. Ask students how the graph of the height of the object is related to the
  path that the object takes as it falls.</p>

<h4>Height as a Quadratic Function</h4>
<p>The general formula for a free falling object is:</p>
<p>\(h(t)=-16t^2+v_0t+h_0\).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the meaning of the coefficients in the formula:</p>
<p>In the formula, \(-16\) is the constant that has been determined by a combination of Newton&rsquo;s Laws and
  Earth&rsquo;s weight and is used with the units feet/second\(^2\).</p>
<p>\(v_0\) is the vertical speed of the object. If the object is simply dropped, the vertical speed is 0. If the object
  were thrown upward, this value would be positive, and if the object were thrown down, this value would be negative.
</p>
<p>\(h_0\) is the initial height of the object.</p>
<p>A man drops his keys from a restaurant at the top of a 196-foot-tall building. If the keys are free falling, will
  they reach the ground within 3 seconds?</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Write an equation for the height at a given time, \(t\).<br>
  \(h(t)=196-16t^2\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Substitute \(t=3\) into the function.<br>
  \(h(3)=196-16(3)^2\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Evaluate.<br>
  \(h(3)=196-144=52\)</p>
<p>At \(t=3\) seconds, the keys will still have 52 feet to travel to hit the ground.</p>
<h4>Try It: Height as a Quadratic Function</h4>
<p>Will the keys in the situation above reach the ground after 5 seconds?</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5> Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to determine if the keys reach the ground in 5 seconds:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Write an equation for the height at a given time, \(t\).<br>
  \(h(t)=196-16t^2\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Substitute \(t=5\) into the function.<br>
  \(h(5)=196-16(5)^2\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Evaluate.<br>
  \(h(5)=196-400=-204\)</p>
<p>The keys reach the ground before \(t=5\) seconds since substituting in 5 creates a negative height, which implies
  they have fallen below ground level and does not make sense for this scenario.</p>
