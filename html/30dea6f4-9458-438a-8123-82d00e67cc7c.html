<h4>Solve a System of Linear Inequalities by Graphing</h4><br>
<p>The solution to a single linear inequality is the region on one side of the boundary line that contains all the points that make the inequality true. The solution to a system of two linear inequalities is a region that contains the solutions to both inequalities. To find this region, we will graph each inequality separately and then locate the region where they are both true. The solution is always shown as a graph.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Solve the system by graphing:&nbsp;</p>
<p>\(\left\{\begin{array}{l}y\geq2x-1\\y&lt;x+1\end{array}\right.\)</p>
