<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li aria-level="1">
    <p role="presentation">Tell whether two expressions are equivalent and explain why or why not.</p>
  </li>
  <li aria-level="1">
    <p role="presentation">Identify the moves that can be made to transform an equation into an equivalent one.</p>
  </li>
  <li aria-level="1">
    <p role="presentation">Explain what it means for two equations to be equivalent, and how equivalent equations can be used to describe the same situation in different ways.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the activities that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li aria-level="1">
    <p role="presentation">1.6.1 Exploring Equivalent Expressions&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li aria-level="2">
      <p role="presentation">In this activity, you substituted values into equivalent expressions to show they are equivalent.&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li aria-level="1">
    <p role="presentation">1.6.2 Expressing Relationships as Equations</p>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li aria-level="2">
      <p role="presentation">In this activity, you wrote equivalent equations given different relationships.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li aria-level="1">
    <p role="presentation">1.6.2 Self Check&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li aria-level="1">
    <p role="presentation">1.6.3 Exploring Related Equations</p>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li aria-level="2">
      <p role="presentation">In this activity, you identified changes that were made to create equivalent equations then determined if other equations were also equivalent after certain moves were made to the equation.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li aria-level="1">
    <p role="presentation">1.6.3 Self Check&nbsp;</p>

    <p role="presentation">1.6.4 Recognizing Related Equations</p>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li aria-level="2">
      <p role="presentation">In this activity, you determined which equations in a given group were all equivalent to each other.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
