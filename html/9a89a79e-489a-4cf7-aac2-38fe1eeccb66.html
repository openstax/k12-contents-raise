 In this lesson, you learned how to: 
<ul>
  <li>Tell whether two expressions are equivalent and explain why or why not.</li>
  <li>Identify the moves that can be made to transform an equation into an equivalent one.</li>
  <li>Explain what it means for two equations to be equivalent, and how equivalent equations can be used to describe the same situation in different ways.</li>
</ul>
 Here are the activities that helped you reach those goals: 
<ul>
  <li>1.6.1 Exploring Equivalent Expressions&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <ul>
    <li>  In this activity, you substituted values into equivalent expressions to show they are equivalent.&nbsp; 
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>1.6.2 Expressing Relationships as Equations</li>
  <ul>
    <li>  In this activity, you wrote equivalent equations given different relationships. 
    </li>
  <li>1.6.2 Self Check&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    1.6.2 Additional Resources&nbsp; 
 </li>
  </ul>
  <li>1.6.3 Exploring Related Equations</li>
  <ul>
    <li>  In this activity, you identified changes that were made to create equivalent equations then determined if other equations were also equivalent after certain moves were made to the equation. 
    </li>
  <li>1.6.3 Self Check&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    1.6.3 Additional Resources&nbsp; 
 </li>
  </ul>
  <li>1.6.4 Recognizing Related Equations</li>
  <ul>
    <li>  In this activity, you determined which equations in a given group were all equivalent to each other. 
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
 <p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>: </p>
