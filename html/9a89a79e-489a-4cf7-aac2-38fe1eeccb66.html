<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<p role="presentation">Tell whether two expressions are equivalent and explain why or why not.</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">
<p role="presentation">Identify the moves that can be made to transform an equation into an equivalent one.</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">
<p role="presentation">Explain what it means for two equations to be equivalent, and how equivalent equations can be used to describe the same situation in different ways.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the activities that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<p role="presentation">1.6.1 Exploring Equivalent Expressions&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">
<p role="presentation">In this activity, you substituted values into equivalent expressions to show they are equivalent.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<p role="presentation">1.6.2 Expressing Relationships as Equations</p>
</li>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">
<p role="presentation">In this activity, you wrote equivalent equations given different relationships.</p>
</li>

<li aria-level="1">
<p role="presentation">1.6.2 Self Check&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">
<p role="presentation">1.6.3 Exploring Related Equations</p>
</li>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">
<p role="presentation">In this activity, you identified changes that were made to create equivalent equations then determined if other equations were also equivalent after certain moves were made to the equation.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li aria-level="1">
<p role="presentation">1.6.4 Recognizing Related Equations</p>
</li>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">
<p role="presentation">In this activity, you determined which equations in a given group were all equivalent to each other.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following practice:</p>
