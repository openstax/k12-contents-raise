<h4>Determining Rate of Change of Linear Functions</h4>
<p>For the table below, assume the function \(f\) is defined for all real numbers. Calculate \(\triangle f=f(x+1)-f(x)\) in the last column. (The symbol \(\triangle\) in this context means &ldquo;change in.&rdquo;) What do you notice about \(\triangle f\)? Could the function be linear or exponential? Write a linear or an exponential function formula that generates the same input&ndash;output pairs as given in the table.</p>

<p>For each row, you subtract \(f(x)\) values. The first row would be \(1- (-3) =4\), then \(5 - 1 =4\), then \(9 - 5 =4\), and then \(13 - 9 = 4\). Think back to the lessons on the slope or rate of change of a linear function. The numerator was always the change in \(y\) or output, which is the same as the change in \(f(x)\). Notice that all the changes in consecutive terms are the same, 4. This means that there is a constant rate of change and this particular function is linear.</p>
<p>Since this function is linear, an equation will have the form \(f(x) = rate \;\ of \;\ change \cdot x+ initial \;\ value\). The rate of change is 4. The initial value is the same as the \(y\)-intercept, or where \(x=0\). \(f(0)\) would be 4 less than the first term listed in this case, which means that \(f(0)= -7\). The linear equation for this table would be \(f(x) = 4x -7\).</p>

  <p>Here is how to write the equation of the graph:</p>
  <p>The graph seems to be linear. If you find the rate of change between consecutive points, you find the graph is linear and the rate of change is \(\frac12\) since the \(y\)-values increase by 1 every time the \(x\)-values increase by 2. Since the graph crosses the \(y\)-axis at \((0,2)\), that is the initial value. The equation for this graph is \(f(x) = \frac{1}{2} x +2\).</p>
