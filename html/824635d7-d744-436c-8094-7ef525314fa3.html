<h4>Using Vertex Form</h4>
<p>The vertex form of a quadratic is below:</p>
<p><img alt="Equation of a parabola in vertex form is labeled with descriptions and color coded. y equals a times the quantity of x minus h squared plus k. A line from the parameter &quot;a&quot; leads to a textbox that describes that it impacts the parabola's vertical reflection if the a is negative, vertical stretch if the a is greater than 1, or vertical compression if the value of a is between 0 and 1. A line from the parameter &quot;h&quot; leads to a textbox that describes how h indicates either a horizontal shift to the right, if h is added, or to the left, if h is subtracted. The final parameter k has a line that leads to a textbox describing how it determines the vertical shift of the function. If the value of k is added, then the parabola is shifted up. If the value of k is subtracted, then the parabola is shifted down." height="157" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/1a98c55ddb5612a215745e1087e68a20afdfaa9a" width="550"/></p>
<p>Notice that the value of \(h\) is the opposite of what it is in the parenthesis. This seems odd: when we add \(k\), the vertex of the parabola moves up \(k\) units. But when we subtract \(h\) within the squared term, the vertex of the parabola moves right \(h\) units, not left.</p>
<p>Let’s explore why. We know the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex is \(y = k\). To find that using this equation, we need to know where \(a(x-h)^2\) is zero, because that will make \(y=k\). Set \(a(x-h)^2=0\) . This happens when \(x-h=0\), which is when \(x=h\). That means \(h\) is the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Find the vertex of \(y=3(x-4)^2-2\).</p>
<p>The parabola of the quadratic will shift right 4 (remember this horizontal shift is counterintuitive and translates in the opposite direction of what the expression “looks like”) and down 2.</p>
<p>So, the vertex is at \((4, -2)\).</p>
