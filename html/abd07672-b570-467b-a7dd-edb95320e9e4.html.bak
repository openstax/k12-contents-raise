<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm up prompts students to analyze and compare the features of the graphs of four functions. In making comparisons, students have a reason to use language precisely. The activity also enables the teacher to hear what terminologies students know and how they talk about characteristics of linear, exponential, and quadratic functions and their graphs.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two to four. Display the graphs for all to see. Give students \(1\) minute of quiet time to think individually and then time to share their thinking with their small group. In their small groups, ask each student to share their reasoning why a particular item does not belong, and together find at least one reason each item doesn’t belong.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Graph A is the only graph where the \(y\)-values don’t change.</p>
<p>Graph B is the only graph where the \(y\)-value increases by a constant rate.</p>
<p>Graph C is the only graph that is not continuous.</p>
<p>Graph D is the only graph that does not intersect the \(y\)-axis at \(2\).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Ask each group to share one reason why a particular item does not belong. Record and display the responses for all to see. After each response, ask the class if they agree or disagree. Since there is no single correct answer to the question of which one does not belong, attend to students’ explanations and ensure the reasons given are correct.</p>
<p>During the discussion, ask students to explain the meaning of any terminology they use, such as "discrete," "increasing," "\(x\)-intercept," and "\(y\)-intercept." Also, press students on unsubstantiated claims.</p></div>
