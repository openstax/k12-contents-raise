<p>In this lesson, you will write, solve, and graph linear inequalities in two variables.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Determine which side of the line the solutions to the inequality will fall, given a two-variable inequality and the graph of the related equation.</li>
  <li>Describe the graph that represents the solutions to a linear inequality in two variables.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are the knowledge and skills you will practice in this lesson. Before you begin, read each one and rate how much you currently know about each one. It&rsquo;s okay if your ratings are low; the purpose of this is to check in with yourself about what you do or do not yet know.</p>
<p><strong>Can you...</strong></p>
