<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p dir="ltr">This warm-up prompts students to compare four scatter plots displaying data with linear and nonlinear trends. It gives students a reason to use language precisely and gives you the opportunity to hear how they use terminology and talk about characteristics of the items in comparison to one another. To allow all students to access the activity, each item has one obvious reason it does not belong. Encourage students to move past the obvious reasons and find reasons based on mathematical properties.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Arrange students in groups of 2&ndash;4. Display the scatter plots for all to see. Ask students to indicate when they have noticed one that does not belong and can explain why. Give students 1 minute of quiet think time and then time to share their thinking with their small group. In their small groups, tell each student to share their reasoning as to why a particular item does not belong, and together find at least one reason each item doesn&rsquo;t belong.</p>

<h4>Student Response</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Sample responses:</p>
<p dir="ltr">A doesn&rsquo;t belong because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is the only scatter plot where a line would fit the data well and is increasing.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">B doesn&rsquo;t belong because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is the only scatter plot where a line would not fit the data well and does not show a pattern.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">C doesn&rsquo;t belong because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is the only scatter plot where a line would fit the data well and is decreasing.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">D doesn&rsquo;t belong because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is the only scatter plot where a line would not fit the data well and does show a curved pattern.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Activity Synthesis</span><br></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Ask each group to share one reason why a particular item does not belong. Record and display the responses for all to see. After each response, ask the class if they agree or disagree. Since there is no single correct answer to the question asking which one does not belong, attend to students&rsquo; explanations and ensure the reasons given are correct.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">During the discussion, ask students to explain the meaning of any terminology they use, such as linear, nonlinear, and random. Also, press students on unsubstantiated claims.</p>
