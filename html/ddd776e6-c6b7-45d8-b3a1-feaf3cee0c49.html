<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<br>
<p>This lesson provides students an introduction to factoring expressions and polynomials. Students will master finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of two or more expressions by factoring the expressions into their prime factors and finding all their common factors. Finding the GCF of expressions is an essential tool used in factoring. Factoring the GCF from a polynomial is often the first step in factoring. It is important to simplify in this way before trying other ways to factor polynomials.</p>
<p>Students will learn to factor a polynomial by grouping in this lesson. They will use the &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; of the Distributive Property, and more complicated ways of factoring by grouping will be taught in later lessons. Finally, students will start to recognize when a polynomial is prime and cannot be factored any further.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Factor an expression into all of its prime factors. </li>
  <li> Find the GCF of two or more expressions by factoring each expression into its prime factors and multiplying all of the common factors shared by each expression. </li>
  <li> Factor the greatest common factor from a polynomial by using the &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; of the Distributive Property. </li>
  <li> Use a grouping method to factor a polynomial when the terms of that polynomial do not share a common factor. </li>
  <li> Recognize when a polynomial cannot be factored using grouping. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Find the greatest common factor of two or more expressions. </li>

Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines. </p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>A1(E) internalize new basic and academic language by using and reusing it in meaningful ways in speaking and writing activities that build concept and language attainment</li>
  <li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
  <li>A3(D) speak using grade-level content area vocabulary in context to internalize new English words and build academic language proficiency</li>
  <li>A3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions</li>
  <li>A3(F) ask and give information ranging from using a very limited bank of high-frequency, high-need, concrete vocabulary, including key words and expressions needed for basic communication in academic and social contexts, to using abstract and content-based vocabulary during extended speaking assignments</li>
  <li>A3(I) adapt spoken language appropriately for formal and informal purposes</li>
</ul>
