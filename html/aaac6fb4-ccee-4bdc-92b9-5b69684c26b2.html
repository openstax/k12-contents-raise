<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Prior to the activity, ask students to volunteer different key characteristics of quadratics that have already been used in the lesson. Examples include: \(x\)-intercepts, zeros, solutions, vertex, maximum, minimum. Collect these words on the board for all to refer to with a diagram of a quadratic.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>While answering the questions below, plot each point on a coordinate plane with grid paper by hand. Do not use technology.</p>
<p>For questions 1â€“4, use the the function \(f(x)=(x-2)(x+4).\)</p>

  <li> What is the equation of the vertical line that goes through the vertex? </li>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=-1\)</p>
<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li> What does the vertical line that goes through the vertex do to the parabola? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Answers may vary. Sample answer: The vertical line \(x= -1\) cuts the parabola in half and creates two symmetrical parts.</p>
<p>This imaginary vertical line that goes through the vertex and cuts the parabola in half is called the axis of symmetry.</p>

  <li> Given a vertex of \((2, -4)\) and a point \((1, 3)\), what is another point on the quadratic? </li>
</ol>
<p>(Hint: It is helpful to draw a picture and use the axis of symmetry).</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since \((-2, 4)\) is the vertex, then \(x=-2\) is the axis of symmetry. If \((1, 3)\) is 3 units away from the axis of symmetry, there is another point 3 units to the left of the axis of symmetry. This is the point \((-5, 3)\).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Focus the discussion on how students determined the key characteristics of the graph.</p>
<p>Ask questions like:</p>
<ul>
  <li> &ldquo;How did you find the \(x\)-intercepts without using a graph? (Using the factored form, set each factor equal to 0 and solve). </li>
  <li> &ldquo;How did you find the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex? (Find the halfway point between the \(x\)-intercepts).&nbsp; </li>
  <li> &ldquo;How did you find the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex? (Substitute the \(x\)-value of the vertex into the function).&nbsp; </li>
  <li> How can you now find the axis of symmetry? (The equation is the same as the \(x\)-value of the vertex).&nbsp; </li>
  <li> How can knowing the axis of symmetry help in graphing? (One possible answer should be that there will always be a point on either side of the parabola equidistant from the axis of symmetry, so if students know one point, they can plot another). </li>
</ul>

<h4>Axis of Symmetry of a Quadratic </h4>
<p>In the graph of a quadratic function, the axis of symmetry is an imaginary line that cuts the parabola in half to create two symmetrical sides. It goes through the vertex of the parabola so the equation of the axis of symmetry is the same as the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex.</p>
<p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-1a59f64e-7fff-f686-b37e-3c95d10108a1"><img src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/7e89a7ce1c5f5104584a662b6f26582bde6ab96a" width="550" height="314" /></strong></p>
<p>Notice that in Figure 1, the vertex is at \((-2, -2)\) and the axis of symmetry is at \(x= -2\).</p>
<p>In Figure 2, the vertex is at \((2, 7)\) and the axis of symmetry is at \(x =2\).</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Find the vertex and axis of symmetry for \(f(x)=(x+2)(x-6)\).</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - &nbsp;Find the \(x\)-intercepts.<br>
  Set each factor equal to 0.<br>
  \(x+2=0\)<br>
  \(x=-2\)<br>
  \(x-6=0\)<br>
  \(x=6\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Find the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex.<br>
  The vertex is halfway between the two \(x\)-intercepts.<br>
  \(x=6+(-2)^2=2\)<br>
  \(x = \frac{6+(-2)}{2} =2\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 </strong>- Find the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex.<br>
  Substitute the \(x\)-coordinate into \(f(x)\).<br>
  \(f(2)=(2+2)(2-6)=(4)(-4)=-6\)<br>
  The vertex is at \((2, -16)\).</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Find the axis of symmetry.<br>
  The axis of symmetry is the equation where \(x\) equals the \(x\)-coordinate of the function.<br>
  \(x= 2\)</p>
  <br>
<h4>Try It: Axis of Symmetry of a Quadratic</h4>
<p>For questions 1 and 2, use the equation of the quadratic, \(f(x)=(x-4)(x-10)\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>What is the vertex of the quadratic?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \((7, -9)\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Find the \(x\)-intercepts.<br>
  Set each factor equal to 0.<br>
  \(x-4=0\)<br>
  \(x=4\)<br>
  \(x-10=0\)<br>
  \(x=10\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Find the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex.<br>
  The vertex is halfway between the two \(x\)-intercepts.<br>
  \(x=\frac{4+10}{2}=7\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Find the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex.<br>
  Substitute the \(x\)-coordinate into \(f(x)\).<br>
  \(f(7)=(7-4)(7-10)=(3)(-3)=-9\)<br>
  The vertex is at \((7, -9)\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>What is the axis of symmetry of the quadratic? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x=7\)</p>
<p>The axis of symmetry is the equation where \(x\) equals the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex.<br>
  \(x= 7\)</p>
