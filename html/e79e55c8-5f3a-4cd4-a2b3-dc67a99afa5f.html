<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In an earlier lesson, students transformed quadratic expressions from standard form into factored form. There, the factored expressions are products of two sums, \((x + m)(x + n)\), or two differences, \((x &minus; m)(x &minus; n)\). Students continue that work in this lesson, extending it to include expressions that can be rewritten as products of a sum and a difference, \((x + m)(x &minus; n)\).</p>
<p>Students will notice that when we apply the distributive property to multiply out a sum and a difference, the product has a negative constant term, but the linear term can be negative or positive. Students will use this insight to transform quadratic expressions into factored form. They see that if a quadratic expression in standard form (with coefficient 1 for \(x^2\)) has a negative constant term, one of its factors must have a negative constant term and the other must have a positive constant term. Emphasize that all of these quadratic expressions have a leading coefficient of 1 on the \(x^2\) term.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Apply the distributive property to multiply a sum and a difference, using a diagram to illustrate the distribution as needed. </li>
  <li> Write a quadratic expression in factored form when given the quadratic expression in the form of \(x^2+ bx + c\), where \(c\) is negative. </li>
  <li> When multiplying a sum and a difference, explain (orally and in writing) how the numbers and signs of the factors relate to the numbers in the product. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Explain how the numbers and signs in a quadratic expression in factored form relate to the numbers and signs in an equivalent expression in standard form. </li>
  <li> Write an equivalent expression in factored form, given a quadratic expression in standard form with a negative constant term. </li>
</ul>
