<p>The population of California was about 20 million in 1970 and 37 million in 2010. </p>
<p>The average rate of change is: \(\frac{37-20}{2010-1970}=\frac{17}{40}=0.425\) million per year. The population of Texas was about 11 million in 1970 and 25 million in 2010. The average rate of change is \(\frac{25-11}{2010-1970}=\frac{14}{40}=0.35\) million per year.</p>

<p>California grew more quickly. Sample reasoning: If we connect each pair of points representing the population of each state in 1900 and 2000, the segment for California has a greater slope, so it has a greater average rate of change.
