<p>In this lesson, you will learn to use graphing technology to find the solution set of a linear inequality in two variables. You will also write linear inequalities to represent the constraints in situations and then use the representations (including the graphs of the solutions) to answer questions about the situations.</p>
<p>Below are the knowledge and skills you will practice in this lesson. Before you begin, read each one and rate how much you currently know about each one. It&rsquo;s okay if your ratings are low; the purpose of this is to check in with yourself about what you do or do not yet know.</p>
<p><strong>Can you...</strong></p>
