    <h4>Making a Real-World Connection</h4>
    <p>Clare, Diego, and Elena collect data on the mass and fuel economy of cars at different dealerships.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Clare finds the line of best fit for data she collected for 12 used cars at a used car dealership. The line of best fit is \(y=\frac{-9}{1000}x+34.3\), where \(x\) is the car&rsquo;s mass, in kilograms, and \(y\) is the fuel economy, in miles per gallon.</p>
    <p>Diego made a scatter plot for the data he collected for 10 new cars at a different dealership.</p>

      <li>The slope means that the fuel economy decreases 9 miles per gallon for every 1,000 kg increase in mass. The \(y\)-intercept represents the fuel economy of a car, in miles per gallon, that has a mass of 0 kg.</li>
      <li>Diego&rsquo;s claim about new cars is correct. You can look at the graph and see that the fuel economy tends to decrease as the mass increases because the scatter plot appears to have a negative slope. Diego&rsquo;s claim about used cars is not correct because the line of best fit has a negative slope, which means that the fuel economy decreases as the mass increases.</li>
      <li>Elena needs to compare the slope of the data for hybrids to the slope of the data for new cars. She could do this by looking at the scatter plots and graphing an approximated line of best for each scatter plot. She could then see which line of best fit looks like it is decreasing faster or find and compare the slopes of each approximated line of best fit.</li>
