<h4>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h4>
<p>The purpose of this warm up is to help students recall finding the slope of a line. Remind students that slope is the ratio of the change in \( y \) and the change in \( x \). Substituting is an important skill in writing equations. </p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Encourage students to write out each step and to use parentheses, especially when working with negative numbers. </p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Use the slope formula, \( m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} \), to find the slope of the line through the given points.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>\( (1, -2) \) and \( (3, 4) \)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
<p>1. \( m= 3 \)</p>
<p>First, name \( (1, &minus;2) \) as point 1 and \( (3, 4) \) as point 2.<br>
  \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \)<br>
  \( (1,&minus;2) \) and \( (3, 4) \)</p>
<p>Use the slope formula.</p>
<p>\( m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} \)<br>
  Substitute the values: \( y_2 = 4, y_1 = -2, x_2 = 3, x_1 = 1 \).<br>
  \( m=\frac{4-(-2)}{3-(1)} \)</p>
<p>Simplify.</p>
<p>\( m=\frac{6}{2} \)<br>
  \( m= 3 \)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>\( (-2, -3) \) and \( (-7, 4) \)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
<p>\( m= -\frac{7}{5} \)<br>
First, name \( (  &minus;2, &minus;3) \) as point 1 and \( (&minus;7, 4) \) as point 2.<br>
\( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \)  <br>
\( (  &minus;2,&minus;3)\) and \( (&minus;7, 4) \)</p>
<p>Use the slope formula.</p>
<p>\( m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} \)<br>
Substitute the values: \( y_2 = 4, y_1 =   &minus;3, x_2 = &minus;7, x_1 = &minus;2 \).<br>
\( m= \frac{4-(-3)}{-7-(-2)} \)  </p>
<p>Simplify.</p>
<p>\( m= \frac{7}{-5} \)<br>
\( m= -\frac{7}{5} \)  </p>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may be confused by the subscripts. Point out that the notation helps make sure that you are matching the correct \( x \)-value with the corresponding \( y \)-value. Demonstrate that you can name either point as \( (x_1, y_1) \) by having students find the slope by naming \( (-7, 4) \) as \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (-2,-3) \) as \( (x_2, y_2) \). </p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Ask students to share their methods for finding the slope. </p>
<p>Discuss with students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;How do you decide which point to use for \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \)?&rdquo; (Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. I substituted the first coordinate pair as \((x_1,y_1)\).)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Does it matter which point you choose for \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \)?&rdquo; (No.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How can you make sure you use the correct corresponding \( x \) for each \( y \)?&rdquo; (Your answer may vary, but here is a sample: Always start with the \(y\) in the second point, so start with \(x\) in the second point).</li>
</ul>
