<p class="os-raise-text-bold"><em>Students will complete the following questions to practice the skills they have learned in this lesson.</em></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>The scatter plot shows the number of times a player came to bat and the number of hits they had. </li>
</ol>
<p>The scatter plot includes a point at \((318,80)\). Describe the meaning of this point in this situation.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> For every 318 at bats, there are 80 hits. </p>
<div class="os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content">
  <p>For questions 2â€”5, use the following to answer each question.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The scatter plot shows the number of minutes people had to wait for service at a restaurant and the number of waitstaff available at the time.</p>
  <p><img alt="A scatter plot. Horizontal, 0 to 9, by point 5&rsquo;s, labeled staff. Vertical, 0 to 13, by point 5&rsquo;s, labeled wait time. 10 dots trend linearly down and to the right." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/6e599432d57f210cffc3af906e753aa20f86cbfa"><br></p>
  <p>A line that models the data is given by the equation \(y=-1.62x+18\), where \(y\) represents the wait time, and \(x\) represents the number of waitstaff available.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>The slope of the line is \(-1.62\). What does this mean in this situation?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> or every increase of 1 staff person, the wait time decreases 1.62 minutes.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li> The slope of the line is \(-1.62\). Is it realistic to conclude, for this slope, as \(x\) increases, \(y\) will decrease?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>The \(y\)-intercept is \((0,18)\). What does this mean in this situation?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> When there are 0 staff people, the wait time is 18 minutes. </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>The \(y\)-intercept is \((0,18)\). Is this a realistic \(y\)-intercept point if \(y\) represents the wait time and \(x\) represents the number of staff available?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> No.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
  <li> The company&rsquo;s pricing plan states that the usage rate is constant for any number of minutes connected to the Internet. The number of minutes is related to the cost in dollars and has a linear relationship. The equation of the line is \(y = 0.03x +0.10\). What does the slope represent in this situation?</li>
</ol>

  <li>Below is a scatter plot of the data with two linear models, \(y=130-5x\) and \(y=25.3+3.66x\). Which of these two models does a better job of describing how shoe length \(x\) and height \(y\) (in inches) are related?</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="A SCATTER PLOT THAT SHOWS SHOE LENGTH ON THE X-AXIS AND HEIGHT ON THE Y-AXIS. TWO DIFFERENT LINEAR MODELS ARE SHOWN, ONE WITH A POSITIVE SLOPE AND ONE WITH A NEGATIVE SLOPE.

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The line of \(y = 25.3 + 3.66x\) is a better choice because as shoe length increases, height tends to increase.</p>

  <li> The scatter plot below displays the elevation and median number of clear days per year of 14 U.S. cities. Two lines are shown on the scatter plot. Which line fits the data better? </li>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Line 2 fits the data better because more points seem to be closer to the line. </p>

  <li>According to the scatter plot below, what claim can be made about women&rsquo;s shoe length and height?</li>
</ol>
<img alt="A SCATTER PLOT THAT SHOWS SHOE LENGTH IN INCHES ON THE X-AXIS AND HEIGHT IN INCHES ON THE Y-AXIS. " height="418" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/711fc739283a09fb281aa876602ac9371fd5be27" width="450">
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> As a woman&rsquo;s shoe length increases, her height also tends to increase. </p>

  <p>For questions 10 &ndash; 12, use the scatter plot below.</p>
  <p>This scatter plot shows foal birth weight and mare&rsquo;s weight.</p>
  <p><img alt="A SCATTER PLOT THAT SHOWS MARE WEIGHT IN KILOGRAMS ON THE X-AXIS AND FOAL WEIGHT IN KILOGRAMS ON THE Y-AXIS." class="atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="311" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/8568caa2f5d1375c92bcdf0e2f9b05d77d12917d" width="450"></p>

<br>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="10">
  <li>What does the slope mean of a linear model on this scatter plot?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The slope represents the increase in foal weight in kg for each kg increase in mare weight</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="11">
  <li> Will the \(y\)-intercept of a linear model make sense in this problem?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> No. When the mare weight is zero, the linear model will be above 0 on the \(y\)-axis.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="12">
  <li>What does the point \((548, 108)\) mean in this problem?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A mare weighing 548 pounds has a foal weighing 108 pounds.</p>
