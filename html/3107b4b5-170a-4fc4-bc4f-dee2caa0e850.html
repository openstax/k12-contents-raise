  <li>The scatter plot shows the number of times a player came to bat and the number of hits they had.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="A scatter plot. Horizontal, 0 to 600, by 50&rsquo;s, labeled at bats.

<div class="editor-indent">
  <p>The scatter plot includes a point at \((318,80)\). Describe the meaning of this point in this situation.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;For every player at 318 bats, there are 80 hits.</p>

  <li><span>The scatter plot shows the number of minutes people had to wait for service at a restaurant and the number of waitstaff available at the time.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="A scatter plot. Horizontal, 0 to 9, by point 5&rsquo;s, labeled staff. Vertical, 0 to 13, by point 5&rsquo;s, labeled wait time. 10 dots trend linearly down and to the right." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/6e599432d57f210cffc3af906e753aa20f86cbfa"><br></p>
<div class="editor-indent">
  <p>A line that models the data is given by the equation \(y=-1.62x+18\), where \(y\) represents the wait time, and \(x\) represents the number of waitstaff available.</p>
</div>
<div class="editor-indent">
  <p><span>The slope of the line is \(-1.62\). What does this mean in this situation? Is it realistic?&nbsp;</span><span>The \(y\)-intercept is \((0,18)\). What does this mean in this situation? Is it realistic?</span></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The slope means that for every increase of 1 waitstaff, the wait time decreases 1.62 minutes. This is a realistic slope. The \(y\)-intercept means that with 0 staff, the wait time is 18 minutes. This is not realistic when there are no staff available.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>The company&rsquo;s pricing plan states that the usage rate is constant for any number of minutes connected to the Internet. The number of minutes is related to the cost in dollars and has a linear relationship. The equation of the line is \(y = 0.03x +0.10\). What does the slope represent in this situation?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;For every minute of Internet usage, the price increases 3 cents.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>Below is a scatter plot of the data with two linear models, \(y=130-5x\) and \(y= 25.3 + 3.66x\). Which of these two models does a better job of describing how shoe length \(x\) and height \(y\) are related? Explain your choice.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="A SCATTER PLOT THAT SHOWS SHOE LENGTH ON THE X-AXIS AND HEIGHT ON THE Y-AXIS. TWO DIFFERENT LINEAR MODELS ARE SHOWN, ONE WITH A POSITIVE SLOPE AND ONE WITH A NEGATIVE SLOPE.

<p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The line of \(y = 25.3 + 3.66x\) is a better choice because as shoe length increases, height tends to increase.&nbsp;</p>

  <li>The scatter plot below displays the elevation and mean number of clear days per year of 14 U.S. cities. Two lines are shown on the scatter plot. Which line fits the data better?</li>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Line 2 fits the data better because more points seem to be closer to the line.</p>

  <li>
    <p>According to the scatter plot below, what claim can be made about women&rsquo;s shoe length and height?</p>
    &nbsp;<img alt="A SCATTER PLOT THAT SHOWS SHOE LENGTH IN INCHES ON THE X-AXIS AND HEIGHT IN INCHES ON THE Y-AXIS. " class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="418" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/711fc739283a09fb281aa876602ac9371fd5be27" width="450">
  </li>
</ol>
<p><span><strong>Answer: </strong>As a woman&rsquo;s shoe length increases, her height also tends to increase.</span></p>
<p>For questions 7&ndash;9, use the scatter plot below.</p>
<p><span>This scatter plot shows foal birth weight and mare&rsquo;s weight.</span><br></p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="7">
  <li>What does the slope of a linear model on this scatter plot mean?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The slope represents the increase in foal weight in kg for each kg increase in mare weight.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="8">
  <li>Will the \(y\)-intercept of a linear model make sense in this problem? Explain.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>No. When the mare weight is zero, the linear model will be above 0 on the \(y\)-axis.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="9">
  <li>What does the point \((548, 108)\) mean in this problem?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>A mare weighing 548 kg weighed 108 kg as a foal.</p>
