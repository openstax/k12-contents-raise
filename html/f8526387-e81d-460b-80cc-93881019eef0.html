<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm up refreshes students&rsquo; ability to convert a quadratic function from standard form to factored form. It also provides practice deriving the solutions, or zeros, of a function from its factored form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students will use graphing technology to analyze the graph of a quadratic function by finding the \(x\)-intercepts and zeros.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Ask students to work through the questions individually, but ask their partner if they have a question.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Write the quadratic function \(f(x) = x^2 &minus; 9x + 20\) in factored form.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(f(x) = (x &minus; 4)(x &minus; 5)\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>What are the solutions of the quadratic equation \((x &minus; 4)(x &minus; 5) = 0\)?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x = 4\) and \(x = 5\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Graph the quadratic function \(f(x) = x^2&minus; 9x + 20\).&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Use the Desmos graphing tool or technology outside the course. (Students were provided access to Desmos.)</p>
<p>What are the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \((4, 0)\), \((5, 0)\) or 4 and 5</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>Marcus states that the zeros of the function of \(f(x) = x^2 &minus; 9x + 20\) are 4 and 5. Do you agree? Explain your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, 4 and 5 are the input values that result in an output of 0. When the function \(f(x) = x^2 &minus; 9x + 20\) is graphed, it crosses the \(x\)-axis at \(x=4\) and \(x=5\).</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Ensure students understand moving from standard form to factored form to deriving solutions or zeros using a quadratic function. After students work through the questions, ask the class as a whole if there are any outstanding questions.</p>
<p>These are important skills that this lesson builds on as students learn more about writing a quadratic function when given its zeros.</p>
