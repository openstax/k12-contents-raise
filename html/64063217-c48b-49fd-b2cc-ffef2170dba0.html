<h3> Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>The tables show the cat population on two islands over several years. Describe mathematically, as precisely as you
  can, how the cat population on each island is changing.</p>

  The cat population on Meow Island is:</p>
<ul>
  <li> tripling each year </li>
  <li> growing by a common ratio each year </li>

  The cat population on Purr Island is:</p>
<ul>
  <li> adding 4 cats each year </li>
  <li> characterized by a common difference each year </li>

<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5> More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to
  slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance
  for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current
  understanding.</p>
