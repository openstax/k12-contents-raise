<p>In this lesson, you will deepen your understanding of functions by comparing representations of several functions relating the same pair of quantities. You will also analyze two or more graphs simultaneously, interpreting their relative features and their average rates of change in context.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compare the features of graphs of functions and explain what they mean in the situations represented.</li>
  <li>Make sense of an equation of the form \(f(x)=g(x)\) in terms of a situation and a graph, and know how to find the solutions.</li>
  <li>Explain statements about two or more functions when they are written in function notation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>4.9.1: Analyzing Graphs and Statements in Function Notation</li>
  <li>4.9.2: Interpreting Graphs and Statements in Terms of a Situation</li>
  <li>4.9.2: Self Check</li>
  <li>4.9.3: Comparing Functions Represented in Separate Graphs</li>
  <li>4.9.3: Self Check</li>
  <li>4.9.4: Compare Graphs and Statements that Represent Functions without a Context</li>
  <li>4.9.4: Self Check</li>
  <li>4.9.5: Analyzing Functions Using Real-World Context</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>
<ul>
