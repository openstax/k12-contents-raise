<p>Here is a system of equations:<br></p>
    <p>\( \begin{align*}12a + 5b = -15\\ 8a + b = 11\end{align*}. \)</p><br>

    <p>To solve this system, Diego wrote these equivalent systems for his first two steps.</p><br>

    <p>Step 1</p>
    <p>\( \begin{align*} 12a + 5b = -15\\ -40a + -5b = -55\end{align*}\)</p>
    <p>Step 2</p>
    <p>\( \begin{align*}12a + 5b = -15\\ -28a = -70\end{align*} \)</p>


<!--Question 1 -->

    <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
      <li> Describe the move that Diego made between the original system and step 1. </li>
    </ol>     
    <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.</p>
    <p>Multiply the second equation by -5. </p>
  
<!--Question 2 -->

    <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
      <li> How do you know the system of equations in step 1 is equivalent to the original system? </li>
    </ol>     
    <p><strong>Answer: </strong> Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.</p>
    <p>Multiplying each side of an equation by the same number gives an equivalent equation with the same solution.</p>
  

<!--Question 3 -->

    <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
      <li> Describe the move that Diego made between step 1 and step 2. </li>
    </ol> 
    <p><strong>Answer: </strong>  Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.</p>
    <p>Multiply the second equation by&nbsp;\( \frac{3}{2} \)&nbsp;and then subtract the resulting equation from the first equation to eliminate the variable \( a \).</span></p>
    <p>\( \left\{ \begin{array}{c l} 12a + 5b = -15\\ 12a + \frac{3}{2}b = \frac{33}{2}\end{array}\right. \)</p>
    <p>\( \left\{ \begin{array}{c l} 12a + 5b = -15\\ \frac{7}{2}b = -\frac{63}{2}\end{array}\right. \)</p>
    <p>Multiply the first equation by -4 and the second equation by 6, and then add the two resulting equations to eliminate the variable \( a \).</p>
    <p>\( \left\{ \begin{array}{c l} -48a - 20b = 60\\ 48a + 6b = 66\end{array}\right. \)</p>\( \left\{ \begin{array}{c l} -14b = 126\\ 48a + 6b = 66\end{array}\right. \)



<!--Question 4 -->

    <ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
      <li> How do you know the system of equations in step 2 is equivalent to the ones in step 1 (and to the original system) </li>
    </ol> 
    <p><strong>Answer: </strong>  
    <p>\(a=\frac52,\;b=-9\\\)</p>
