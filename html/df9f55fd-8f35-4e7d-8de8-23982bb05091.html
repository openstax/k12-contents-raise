<h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>
<p>This is the first of a series of lessons in which students review what they learned about systems of equations in
  middle school and develop new techniques for solving them.</p>
<p>In this lesson, students recall that a system of equations in two variables is a set of equations that represent
  multiple constraints in the same situation and that a solution to the system is any pair of values that satisfy all
  the constraints simultaneously. Students also revisit the idea that the solution, if there is one, can be represented
  graphically as the intersection of the graphs of the equations.</p>
<p>Students write a system of equations to represent the quantities and constraints in each of several situations, find
  a solution that meets multiple constraints by graphing, and then interpret the solution in context. In the process,
  they reason both abstractly and quantitatively. As they analyze relationships mathematically and reflect on the
  results, students also engage in aspects of modeling.</p>
<p>Some students who recall the work on systems of equations from grade 8 may choose to solve the systems algebraically.
  This is appropriate and welcome, but it is not necessary to introduce the idea to the class here. Students will use
  algebra to solve systems starting in the next lesson.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Solve systems of linear equations by reasoning with tables and by graphing and explain (orally and in writing) the
    solution method.</li>
  <li>Explain that the solution to a system of equations in two variables is a pair of values that simultaneously make
    both equations true and that it is represented by the intersection point of the graphs of the equations.</li>
  <li>Explain that two (or more) equations that represent the constraints on the same quantities in the same situation
    form a system.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Explain &ldquo;the solution to a system of linear equations&rdquo; and how the solution is represented
    graphically.</li>
  <li>Refer to two equations as a system of equations.</li>
  <li>Use tables and graphs to solve systems of equations.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners
</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are
  only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.
  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A1(F) use accessible language and learn new and essential language in the process
  </li>
  <li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and
    reinforce concept and language attainment
  </li>
  <li>A2(I) demonstrate listening comprehension of increasingly complex spoken English by following directions,
    retelling or summarizing spoken messages, responding to questions and requests, collaborating with peers, and taking
    notes commensurate with content and grade-level needs
  </li>
  <li>A3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions
  </li>
  <li>A3(F) ask and give information ranging from using a very limited bank of high-frequency, high-need, concrete
    vocabulary, including key words and expressions needed for basic communication in academic and social contexts, to
    using abstract and content-based vocabulary during extended speaking assignments
  </li>
  <li>A3(I) adapt spoken language appropriately for formal and informal purposes
  </li>
  <li>A4(F) use visual and contextual support and support from peers and teachers to read grade-appropriate content area
