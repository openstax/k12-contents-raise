<p>Throughout this unit you learned that farmers, such as the Black and underserved farmers Farms To Grow founders Gordon Reed and Gail Myers work with, can use statistics to help them make decisions about their business. Statistics can help them decide the amount of crops they should grow, and how to package and ship their product. They can study weather and rainfall patterns and investigate how types of soil affects their crop. These decisions help assure them they will have a sustainable farm. </p>
<p>In this unit, you learned how a linear model is used to describe the relationship between two variables quantitatively. You learned that a linear model is an approximation based on data from a scatter plot. The linear model allows you to make predictions in a range near the given data.   </p>
<p>You used technology to find the equation of the line of best fit and interpreted the slope and \(y\)-intercepts in the context of the situation. You used the linear model to estimate values not given in the data set.</p>
<p>You assessed the fit of the linear model informally using residuals and them formally using the correlation coefficient. 
</p>
<p>Finally, you learned that if a change in one of the variables directly causes a change in the other variable, then it is a causal relationship. You learned that a strong correlation does not imply a causal relationship, so you learned to analyze the relationship between two variables to determine whether they are causal or not.

<h4>Building Character: Purpose
</h4>
<p>Throughout this unit, you learned that having <strong>purpose</strong> is good for both you and the world. It drives you to make positive contributions to the world that are in line with your own interests and strengths, as you saw Gordon and Gail do with their organization. As you continue along your journey in school and beyond, remember to think about what you want to contribute to the world and how you can be helpful to others. This may help you lead a happier, more fulfilling life.</p>
