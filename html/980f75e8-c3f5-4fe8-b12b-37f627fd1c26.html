<h4>Determining and Comparing Linear and Exponential Functions</h4>
<p>Mr. Smith has an apple orchard. He hires his daughter, Lucy, to pick apples and offers her two payment options:</p>
<p>Option A: $1.50 per bushel of apples picked</p>
<p>Option B: 1 cent for coming to work, 3 cents for picking one bushel, 9 cents for picking two bushels, 27 cents for
  picking three bushels, and so on, with the amount of money tripling for each additional bushel picked</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Which option is linear, and which option is exponential? How do you know? </li>
  <li> Create a table to model each scenario. </li>
  <li> If she picks 6 bushels, which option is better? </li>
  <li> If she picks 12 bushels, which option is better? </li>
  <li> How many bushels does she need to pick for Option B to be better than Option A? </li>
</ol>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first think about linear and exponential functions in general. Let&rsquo;s also consider Options A and B
  when \(x\) represents the bushels of apples picked and \(f(x)\) represents the total amount she earns based on \(x\)
  bushels of apples.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Since Option A is $1.50 per bushel picked, it is linear. For Option B, the amount of money is tripling for each
    bushel picked, so it is exponential. </li>
</ol>

  <li> To determine which scenario is better when she picks 6 bushels, you can look at the values in your table, or you

  <p>Compare your answer:</p>
  <p>Here is how to determine which of Jayden&rsquo;s plans Mrs. Maroney should choose:</p>
  <p>Plan 1 is a linear plan since it&rsquo;s $5 per day. Plan 2 is doubling each day, so it is an exponential plan.
    Every other example has shown us that the exponential plan is going to be greater eventually. Since Mrs. Maroney
    needs Jayden for 2 weeks, or 14 days, we need to determine when Plan 2 becomes greater than Plan 1.</p>
  <p>Plan 1 for 14 days would be:</p>
  <p>\(5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5 = 5 \cdot 14 = $70\)</p>
  <p>Plan 2 for 14 days would be:</p>
  <p>\(.01 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 =

  <p>Plan 1 would be better for Mrs. Maroney.</p>
