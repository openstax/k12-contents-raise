<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Find solutions to quadratic equations by reasoning about the values that make the equation true. </li>
  <li> Explain that quadratic equations may have one or two solutions. </li>
  <li> Implement the square root property. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> 8.3.1: Determining the Number of Solutions </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you analyzed various quadratic equations to determine the number of unique solutions that made the equation true. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 8.3.2: Recognizing Pairs of Solutions </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you learned how to use the square root property to reason about the values that made a quadratic equation true. </li>
    <li> 8.3.2: Self Check </li>
    <li> 8.3.2: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 8.3.3: Solving More Complex Quadratic Equations </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you continued to explore how to solve quadratic equations as they took on a more complicated form, such as \(a(x &minus; h)^2= k\). </li>
    <li> 8.3.3: Self Check </li>
    <li> 8.3.3: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 8.3.4: Finding the Solutions </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you solved quadratic equations of any format from this lesson without any additional context for how to begin finding the solution. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following<strong> practice</strong>:</p>
