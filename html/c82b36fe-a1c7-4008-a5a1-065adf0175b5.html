<p>The following general instructional strategies can be used to enhance access for all students to rigorous, grade-level content:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- Accordion Item #1-->
<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> Eliminate Barriers</button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>Eliminate any unnecessary barriers that students may encounter that prevent them from engaging with the critical mathematical work of a lesson. This requires flexibility and attention to areas such as the classroom's physical environment, access to tools, organization of lesson activities, and means of communication.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<!-- Accordion Item #2-->
<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> Processing Time</button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>Increased time engaged in thinking and learning leads to mastery of grade-level content for all students, including students with disabilities. Frequent switching between topics creates confusion and does not allow content to be deeply embedded in the learner's mind. Mathematical ideas and representations are carefully introduced in the materials in a gradual, purposeful way to establish a base of conceptual understanding. Some students may need additional time, which should be provided as required.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<!-- Accordion Item #3-->
<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> Assistive Technology</button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>Assistive technology can be vital for students with learning disabilities, visual-spatial needs, sensory integration, and autism. The materials suggest assistive technology supports designed to enhance or support learning or bypass unnecessary barriers.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<!-- Accordion Item #4-->
<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> Manipulatives</button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>Physical manipulatives help students connect concrete ideas with abstract representations. Often, students with disabilities benefit from hands-on activities that allow them to make sense of the problem at hand and communicate their own mathematical ideas and solutions.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<!-- Accordion Item #5-->
<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> Visual Aids</button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>Visual aids such as images, diagrams, vocabulary anchor charts, color coding, or physical demonstrations are suggested throughout the materials to support conceptual processing and language development. Keeping relevant visual aids posted in the classroom promotes independence by allowing students to access them as needed, especially for students with working or short-term memory challenges.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<!-- Accordion Item #6-->
<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> Graphic Organizers</button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>Word webs, Venn diagrams, tables, and other metacognitive visual supports provide structures that illustrate relationships between mathematical facts, concepts, words, or ideas. Graphic organizers can help students organize thoughts and ideas, plan problem-solving approaches, visualize ideas, sequence information, and compare and contrast ideas.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<!-- Accordion Item #7-->
<div class="os-raise-accordion-item">
  <button class="os-raise-accordion-header"> <!-- Header goes here --> Brain Breaks</button>
  <div class="os-raise-accordion-content"> 
    <!-- Content goes here -->
    <p>Brain breaks are short, structured, two to three minute movement breaks taken between activities or to break up a longer activity (approximately every 20â€“30 minutes during class). Brain breaks are a quick, effective way of refocusing and re-energizing students' physical and mental state during a lesson. Brain breaks have also been shown to positively impact student concentration and stress levels, resulting in more time engaged in mathematical problem-solving. This universal support benefits all students, especially those with attention challenges or disorders.</p>
