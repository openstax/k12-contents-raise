<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>The mathematical purpose of this activity is for students to interpret the slope (rate of change) and the intercept (constant term) of a linear model in the context of the data. Students are given scatter plots for different pairs of variables and the equation of a line of best fit. Students use the line of best fit and its equation to describe the meaning of the vertical intercept and slope.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Ask students to compare their responses to their partner’s for the scatter plots and decide if both their responses are correct for each scatter plot, even if they are different. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>

<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>Clare, Diego, and Elena collect data on the mass and fuel economy of cars at different dealerships. </p>
<p>Clare finds the line of best fit for data she collected for 12 used cars at a used car dealership. The line of best fit is \(y=\frac{-9}{1,000}x+34.3\) where \(x\) is the car’s mass, in kilograms, and \(y\) is the fuel economy, in miles per gallon.</p>
<p>Diego made a scatter plot for the data he collected for 10 new cars at a different dealership.</p>
<p><img alt="A scatter plot with a negative correlation. The x-axis represents mass measured in kilograms and extends from 1,200 to 2,400 with a scale of 200.

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>Interpret the slope and \(y\)-intercept of Clare’s line of best fit in this situation.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The slope means that the fuel economy decreases 9 miles per gallon for every 1,000 kg increase in mass. The \(y\)-intercept represents the fuel economy of a car, in miles per gallon, that has a mass of 0 kg.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li>Diego looks at the data for new cars and used cars. He claims that the fuel economy of new cars decreases as the mass increases. He also claims that the fuel economy of used cars increases as the mass increases. Do you agree with Diego’s claims? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Diego’s claim about new cars is correct. You can look at the graph and see that the fuel economy tends to decrease as the mass increases because the scatter plot appears to have a negative slope. Diego’s claim about used cars is not correct because the line of best fit has a negative slope, which means that the fuel economy decreases as the mass increases.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
<li>Elena looks at the data for hybrid cars and correctly claims that the fuel economy decreases as the mass increases. How could Elena compare the decrease in fuel economy as mass increases for hybrid cars to the decrease in fuel economy as mass increases for new cars? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Elena needs to compare the slope of the data for hybrids to the slope of the data for new cars. She could do this by looking at the scatter plots and graphing an approximated line of best for each scatter plot. She could then see which line of best fit looks like it is decreasing faster or find and compare the slopes of each approximated line of best fit.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>The purpose of this discussion is for students to describe the rate of change and the vertical intercept using the context in each graph.</p>
<p>For each question, give students time to think individually and then share their response with their partner. Then select a student or pair of students to respond to the question. Ask students:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Why is the intercept for the bananas not \((0,0)\)?” (A linear model is not exact even for the data it is based on. It is an approximation based on the data in the scatter plot. It is possible that it represents the weight of the bag that bananas were placed in. It is also possible that this value does not make sense since there is no evidence to believe the same linear relationship will hold near zero.)<br/>
</li>
<li>“How do you interpret the slope for each equation?” (The slope is the change in \(y\) divided by the change in \(x\), so look at the labels on the scatter plot and talk about for each increase of 1 on the \(x\) variable, on average, there is a decrease (if the slope is negative) or increase (if the slope is positive) in the variable represented by the \(y\)-direction.)<br/>
</li>
<li>“When might it make sense to interpret the \(y\)-intercept for a linear model?” (When \(x\)-values around 0 are in the range of the data used to create the model. In other cases, care should be taken not to put too much faith in the answer since the linear trend may not continue to hold farther from the collected data.)<br/>
</li>

<td> As video game time increases, sleep time decreases. </td>
<td> That’s correct! Check yourself: As the number of hours spent on video games increases, the line goes down, so the number of hours spent sleeping decreases. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> There is not a trend between time spent on video games and sleep time. </td>
<td> Incorrect. Let’s try again a different way: There is a linear model to the data points. The answer is as video game time increases, sleep time decreases. </td>

<h4>Using Linear Models</h4>
<p>The Monopoly board game is popular in many countries. The scatter plot below shows the distance from “Go” to a property (in number of spaces moving from “Go” in a clockwise direction) and the price of the properties on the Monopoly board. The equation of the line is \(P = 8x + 40\), where \(P\) represents the price (in Monopoly dollars) and \(x\) represents the distance (in number of spaces). </p>
<p><img alt='A scatter plot that shows the "distance from go" in number of spaces on the x-axis and the price of a property in monopoly dollars on the y-axis. The line drawn increases from left to right.' class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="428" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/a1dd8ae78f10fad19e82582491e9abe66a924fce" width="450"/><br/>
</p>
<p>The model shows that as the distance from “Go” increases, the price of the property increases.</p>
<p>The slope of the equation of the linear model is 8. This means that for every space from “Go,” the price of the property increases $8. </p>
<p>Notice this gives an estimate. The most expensive property is 39 spaces from “Go” and costs $400. The model would give the price to be \(y=8(39)+40\) or $352.</p>
<p>The model gives a difference of $48 between the estimated price using the model and the actual price.</p>
