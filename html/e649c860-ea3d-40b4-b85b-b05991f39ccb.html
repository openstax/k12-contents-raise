<p>In this lesson, you will build on the idea that both graphing and rewriting quadratic equations in the form of <em>expression</em> = 0 are useful strategies for solving equations. You will also review the ties between the zeros of a function and the horizontal intercepts of its graph, which you began exploring in an earlier unit.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> Explain why dividing by a variable to solve a quadratic equation is not a good strategy. </li>
  <li> Explain why quadratic equations can have no solutions and explain why there are none. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the<strong> activities </strong>that will help you reach those goals:</p>
