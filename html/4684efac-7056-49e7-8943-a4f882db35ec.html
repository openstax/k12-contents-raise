<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here are graphs that represent three quadratic functions, defined by:</p>
<p>\(f(x)=x^2-4\)<br>
  \(g(x)=1-x^2\)<br>
  \(h(x)=x^2+4\)</p>
<p><img alt="Coordinate plane with 3 quadratic functions. Curve A opens up and has minimum at 0 comma 4. Curve B opens up and has minimum at negative 4 comma 0.

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Which graph represents the equation \(f(x)=x^2-4\)?</li>
</ol>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Green Graph A </li>
  <li> Blue Graph B </li>
  <li> Black Graph C </li>

<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Green Graph A </li>

  <li> Black Graph C </li>

  <li>Which graph represents the equation \(h(x)=x^2+4\)?</li>
</ol>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Green Graph A </li>
  <li> Blue Graph B </li>
  <li> Black Graph C </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Green Graph A</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>Which part of the equation tells us that Graph C opens downward?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> \(y=1-x^2\) is the equation. The negative coefficient of \(x^2\) makes the graph open downward.</p>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>Press Pause</h5>
<p>If students are still struggling with finding \(x\)- and \(y\)-intercepts of the graph, consider skipping lesson 7.13 and, instead, addressing misconceptions in the cool downs and working on practice problems.</p>
