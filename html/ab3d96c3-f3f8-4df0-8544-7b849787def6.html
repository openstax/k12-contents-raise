<h4>Activity P8.3: Modeling Rocket Flight Using a Quadratic Equation</h4>
<p>Alejandra lights the fuse on a small toy rocket. The fuse burns down and, after 1 second, the rocket launches into the air. The rocket lands back on the ground after 6 seconds.</p>
<p>After 5 seconds from when Alejandra lit the fuse, the height of the rocket was 8 meters.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>What is the quadratic equation in standard form that models the flight of the rocket? (Hint: Think of the problem as a quadratic function in which you know the zeros and a point through which the function passes.)</li>
  <li>Use the equation you found in the previous question to find the height of the rocket, in meters, 3 seconds after Alejandra lit the fuse.</li>
</ol>
