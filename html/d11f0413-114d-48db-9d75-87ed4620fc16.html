        <p>This Math Talk invites students to use what they know about fractions, decimals, and the meaning of percent to mentally solve problems. The strategies elicited here will be helpful later in the lesson when students calculate prices that involve a percent increase and write an equation to generalize the calculation.</p>
        <p>Finding different percents of the same value (200) is also an opportunity to reason repeatedly and look for and make use of structure. </p>
        <p>Students are likely to approach the problems in different ways. They may:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Convert each percentage into a fraction and multiply the fraction by 200. For example, they may think of 25% as <span class="math math-repaired">\( \frac14 \)</span>, 12% as <span class="math math-repaired">\( \frac{12}{100} \)</span> or <span class="math math-repaired">\( \frac{3}{25} \)</span>, and 8% as <span class="math math-repaired">\( \frac{8}{100} \)</span> or <span class="math math-repaired">\( \frac{2}{25} \)</span>.</li>
          <li>Convert each percentage into a decimal and multiply it by 200.</li>
          <li>Notice that 1% of 200 is 2 and that any percentage of 200 can be found by multiplying the percentage by 2. For example, 25% of 200 is <span class="math math-repaired">\( 25 \cdot 2 \)</span>, and <span class="math math-repaired">\( p \)</span>% of 200 is <span class="math math-repaired">\( p \cdot 2 \)</span> or <span class="math math-repaired">\( 2p \)</span>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Display one problem at a time. Give students quiet time to think individually for each problem and ask them to give a signal when they have an answer and a strategy. Keep all problems displayed throughout the talk. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>

        <h3><span>Student-Facing Statement</span></h3>
        <p>You will be asked to evaluate the percentage of a number mentally. Sometimes, a visual is helpful to do this. If needed, use the GeoGebra activity to help you determine the requested values. Then, look for a pattern that can be used to describe how to find the percentage of any number. </p>

          <li>How would you determine \( p \)% of \(&nbsp;200&nbsp;\)?</li>
        </ol>
         <p> <strong>Answer:</strong></p>
         <p>Your answers may vary, here are some examples:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>\(2p\)</li>
           <li>\(\frac{p}{100} \cdot 200\)</li>
           <li>Change the percentage to a decimal and multiply it by 200.</li>
           <li>Since percent means “per hundred” and there are two-hundreds, the percentage is multiplied by two.</li>
         </ul>


        
        <h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
        <div class="body">
          <p>Ask students to share their strategies for each problem. Record and display their responses for all to see. To involve more students in the conversation, consider asking:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>&ldquo;Who can restate <span class="math math-repaired">\( \underline{\hspace{.5in}} \)&rsquo;</span>s reasoning in a different way?&rdquo;</li>
            <li>&ldquo;Did anyone have the same strategy but would explain it differently?&rdquo;</li>
            <li>&ldquo;Did anyone solve the problem in a different way?&rdquo;</li>
            <li>&ldquo;Does anyone want to add on to <span class="math math-repaired">\( \underline{\hspace{.5in}} \)&rsquo;</span>s strategy?&rdquo;</li>
            <li>&ldquo;Do you agree or disagree? Why?&rdquo;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If one of the strategies shown in the Narrative is not mentioned, consider sharing it with students. </p>
