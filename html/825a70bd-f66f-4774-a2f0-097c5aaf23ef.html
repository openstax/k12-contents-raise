<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In this lesson, students begin to solve quadratic equations by reasoning about what values would make the equations true and by using structure in the equations. The idea that some quadratic equations have two solutions is also made explicit. Students may begin to record their reasoning process as steps for solving, but this is not critical at this point as it will be emphasized in a later lesson.</p>
<p>As students reason about an equation, they may intuitively perform the same operation on each side of the equal sign to get closer to the solution(s). In the warm up activity, refrain from telling students to &ldquo;take the square root of each side.&rdquo; Instead, focus on reasoning about values that would make the equation true.</p>
<p>For example, to solve \(4x^2=100\), we could divide each side by 4 and get \(x^2=25\). Encourage students to interpret this equation as: &ldquo;Some number being squared gives 25&rdquo; and to reason: &ldquo;There are two different values that can be squared to get 25: &ndash;5 and 5.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Initially reasoning this way helps curb the following common misconception:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>The only solution to an equation such as \(x^2 = 25\) is \(\sqrt{25}\). Each positive number has two square roots, one positive and the other negative. By convention, the radical symbol \(\sqrt{}\) refers to the positive square root. So the number \(\sqrt{25}\) refers only to the positive square root of 25 and does not capture the negative square root. </li>
</ul>
<p>In the second activity, the square root property is introduced, establishing that taking the square root of a number yields two possible solutions: a positive square root and a negative square root.</p>
<p>Technology isn&rsquo;t required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems. Consider making technology available.</p>
