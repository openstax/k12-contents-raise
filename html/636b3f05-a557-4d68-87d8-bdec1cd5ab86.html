<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<div>
<p>In the first activity of the lesson, students consider whether the expression&nbsp;<span>\( 2x+3y \)</span>&nbsp;is greater than, less than, or equal to 12 for given&nbsp;<span>\( (x,y) \)</span>&nbsp;pairs. This warm-up familiarizes students with the computation and reasoning that they will need later to determine the solution region of a linear inequality in two variables.</p>
<p>Students could reason about the answers by considering the signs and relative sizes of the&nbsp;<span>\( x \)</span>- and&nbsp;<span>\( y \)</span>-values, rather than performing full computations.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<div>
<p>Display one problem at a time. Give students quiet time to think individually for each problem and ask them to give a signal when they have an answer and a strategy. Keep all problems displayed throughout the talk. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>
<h4>Support for Students with Disabilities</h4>
<div><em>Representation: Internalize Comprehension.</em>&nbsp;To support working memory, provide students with sticky notes or mini whiteboards.<br><em>Supports accessibility for: Memory; Organization</em></div>

<h3>Student Facing Statement</h3>
<div>
<p>Here is an expression:&nbsp;<span>\( 2x+3y \)</span>.</p>
<p>Decide if the values in each ordered pair,&nbsp;<span>\( (x, y) \)</span>, make the value of the expression less than, greater than, or equal to 12.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li><span>\( (0, 5) \)</span></li>
<li><span>\( (6,0) \)</span></li>
<li><span>\( (\text-1, \text-1) \)</span></li>
<li><span>\( (\text-5,10) \)</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Student Response</h3>
<div>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li><span>greater than 12</span></li>
<li><span>equal to 12</span></li>
<li><span>less than 12</span></li>
<li><span>greater than 12</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<div>
<p>Ask students to share their strategies for each problem. Record and display their responses for all to see. To involve more students in the conversation, consider asking:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Who can restate&nbsp;<span>\( \underline{\hspace{.5in}} \)</span>'s reasoning in a different way?"</li>
<li>"Did anyone have the same strategy but would explain it differently?"</li>
<li>"Did anyone solve the problem in a different way?"</li>
<li>"Does anyone want to add on to&nbsp;<span>\( \underline{\hspace{.5in}} \)</span>'s strategy?"</li>
<li>"Do you agree or disagree? Why?"</li>
</ul>
<p>To help students recall the meaning of a solution to an inequality, ask: "Which pairs, if any, are solutions to the inequality&nbsp;<span>\( 2x + 3y \leq 12 \)</span>?" Make sure students recognize that both&nbsp;<span>\( (\text-1,\text-1) \)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>\( (6,0) \)</span>&nbsp;are solutions because they make the inequality true.</p>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<div>
<p><em></em>Display sentence frames to support students when they explain their strategy. For example, "First, I _____ because.." or "I noticed _____ so I.." Some students may benefit from the opportunity to rehearse what they will say with a partner before they share with the whole class.<br></p>
