<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>In the first activity of the lesson, students consider whether the expression \( 2x+3y \) is greater than, less than, or equal to 12 for given \( (x,y) \) pairs. This warm-up familiarizes students with the computation and reasoning that they will need later to determine the solution region of a linear inequality in two variables.</p>
<p>Students could reason about the answers by considering the signs and relative sizes of the \( x \)- and \( y \)-values, rather than performing full computations. </p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Display one problem at a time. Give students quiet time to think individually for each problem and ask them to give a signal when they have an answer and a strategy. Keep all problems displayed throughout the talk. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here is an expression:</p>
<p>\(2x+3y\)</p>
<p>Decide if the values in each ordered pair, \((x,y)\), make the value of the expression less than, greater than, or equal to 12.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> \((0, 5)\) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> greater than 12</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li> \((6, 0)\) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> equal to 12</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>\((-1, -1)\) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> less than 12</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li> \((-5, 10)\) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> greater than 12</p>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>Ask students to share their strategies for each problem. Record and display their responses for all to see. To involve more students in the conversation, consider asking:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Who can restate \( \underline{\hspace{.5in}} \)'s reasoning in a different way?"</li>
  <li>"Did anyone have the same strategy but would explain it differently?"</li>
  <li>"Did anyone solve the problem in a different way?"</li>
  <li>"Does anyone want to add on to \( \underline{\hspace{.5in}} \)'s strategy?"</li>
  <li>"Do you agree or disagree? Why?"</li>
</ul>
<p>To help students recall the meaning of a solution to an inequality, ask: "Which pairs, if any, are solutions to the inequality \( 2x + 3y \leq 12 \)?" Make sure students recognize that both \( (\text-1,\text-1) \) and \( (6,0) \) are solutions because they make the inequality true.</p>

<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<p> Display sentence frames to support students when they explain their strategy. For example, "First, I _____ because.." or "I noticed _____ so I.." Some students may benefit from the opportunity to rehearse what they will say with a partner before they share with the whole class.
