<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>In the first activity of the lesson, students consider whether the expression \( 2x+3y \) is greater than, less than, or equal to 12 for given \( (x,y) \) pairs. This warm up familiarizes students with the computation and reasoning that they will need later to determine the solution region of a linear inequality in two variables.</p>
<p>Students could reason about the answers by considering the signs and relative sizes of the \( x \)- and \( y \)-values, rather than performing full computations. </p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Display one problem at a time. Give students quiet time to think individually for each problem and ask them to give a signal when they have an answer and a strategy. Keep all problems displayed throughout the talk. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here is an expression:</p>
<p>\(2x+3y\)</p>
<p>Decide if the values in each ordered pair, \((x,y)\), make the value of the expression less than, greater than, or equal to 12.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> \((0, 5)\) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> greater than 12</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li> \((6, 0)\) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> equal to 12</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>\((-1, -1)\) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> less than 12</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li> \((-5, 10)\) </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> greater than 12</p>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>Ask students to share their strategies for each problem. Record and display their responses for all to see. To involve more students in the conversation, consider asking:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Who can restate \( \underline{\hspace{.5in}} \)'s reasoning in a different way?"</li>
  <li>"Did anyone have the same strategy but would explain it differently?"</li>
  <li>"Did anyone solve the problem in a different way?"</li>
  <li>"Does anyone want to add on to \( \underline{\hspace{.5in}} \)'s strategy?"</li>
  <li>"Do you agree or disagree? Why?"</li>
</ul>
<p>To help students recall the meaning of a solution to an inequality, ask: "Which pairs, if any, are solutions to the inequality \( 2x + 3y \leq 12 \)?" Make sure students recognize that both \( (\text-1,\text-1) \) and \( (6,0) \) are solutions because they make the inequality true.</p>
