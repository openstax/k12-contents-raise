<h4>Representing a Linear Function in Tabular Form</h4>
<p>A system of equations is two or more equations. Often, each equation in a system of equations represents a situation. Like other equations, the equations that make up the system can be represented by a table. When writing any equation from a table into slope-intercept form, two things are needed: a slope and point, often the /(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p>Example: Suppose a maglev train travels a long distance, and maintains a constant speed of 83 meters per second for a period of time once it is 250 meters from the station. Here is a table that shows this constant speed.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Find the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p>Notice that when \(t = 0, D(t)=250\). This is the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Find the slope.</p>
<p>To find the slope, find the change of \(y\) over the change of \(x: m=831=83\).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Write the equation in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p>\(y=mx +b\), where \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p>\(y =83x +250\)</p>

<p>Here is how to write an equation from the table.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Find the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p>Notice that when \(x = 0\), \(H(x)=12.5\). This is the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 </strong>- Find the slope.</p>
<p>To find the slope, find the change of \(y\) over the change of \(x\): \(m=12=0.5\).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Write the equation in slope-intercept form.</p>
<p>\(y=mx +b\), where \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p>\(y =0.5x +12.5\)</p>
