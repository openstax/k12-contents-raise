<h4>Connecting Tables and Graphs in Exponential Decay Functions</h4>
<p>A population \(p\) of migrating butterflies satisfies the equation \(p=100,000 \cdot (\frac{4}{5})^w\), where \(w\)
  is the number of weeks since they began their migration.</p>
<p>Answer the following questions that would complete the table and create a graph to show the population \(p\) of
  migrating butterflies at the number of weeks since they began their migration.</p>

  <li> The number of butterflies 1 week after they began their migration.</li>
  <li> The number of butterflies 3 weeks after they began their migration.</li>
  <li> Create a graph that best represents the butterfly population. </li>
  <li> What is the vertical intercept, or \(y\)-intercept, of the graph? What does it tell you about the butterfly population? </li>
  <li> When does the butterfly population reach approximately 50,000? </li>
  <li>What is the asymptote of the graph? What does it tell you about the butterfly population over time?</li>
</ol>
<p>When you have the equation that represents the situation, you can substitute values in and use the order of
  operations to find the values for the table.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Part 1 is asking for the initial value. Since the equation \(p=100,000\cdot(\frac{4}{5})^w\) is in the form
    \(y=ab^x\), you know the initial value is \(a\) or 100,000. </li>
  <li> Part 2 is 1 week after migration, so replace the \(w\) in the equation with 1 to get 80,000. </li>
  <li>In part 3, the \(w\) can be replaced with 3 to get 51,200. </li>
  <li> The rest of the values of the table can be found the same way, and once you have the completed table, you can
    plot the points. Once you have plotted the points, you can connect them with a smooth curve. </li>

<ul>
  <li> Part 5 asks about the vertical intercept and what it means. The vertical intercept is 100,000, which is the
    initial amount of the butterfly population. This means that when the butterflies start their migration (at
    \(w=0\) weeks), the population is initially 100,000.<br><br>
    The \(y\)-intercept is the value of \(p\) when
    \(w=0\), which corresponds to the initial condition or starting point of the migration. Substituting \(w=0\) into the equation, we have \(p=100000 \cdot (\frac{4}{5})^0=100000 \cdot 1=100000\).
  </li>
  <li> For part 6, you could continue the table or use the graph to see where it is 50,000, which is around 3 weeks.

<ul>
  <li>For part 7, an asymptote is a line or curve that a function approaches but does not intersect or touch. In other words, as the input values of a function approach a certain value or tend towards infinity or negative infinity, the function values get arbitrarily close to the asymptote without actually crossing it. Asymptotes can provide valuable information about the behavior of a function and can help in understanding its limits and range.
    <br><br>
    To determine the asymptote, we examine the behavior of the function as ùë§ approaches infinity. In this case, as ùë§ becomes larger and larger, the term \((\frac{4}{5})^ùë§\) will grow exponentially smaller. Consequently, the population ùëù will also grow infinitely smaller as it gets closer and closer to zero. Thus, the horizontal asymptote in this equation is the \(x\)-axis. The graph of the function will continue to decrease towards the \(x\)-axis as ùë§ increases, approaching \(y = 0\). The butterfly population will decrease over time due to the migration.
