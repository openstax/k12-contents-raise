<h4>Connecting Tables and Graphs in Exponential Decay Functions</h4>
<p>A population \(p\) of migrating butterflies satisfies the equation \(p=100,000 \cdot (\frac{4}{5})^w\), where \(w\) is the number of weeks since they began their migration.</p>
<p>Answer the following questions that would complete the table and create a graph to show the population \(p\) of migrating butterflies at the number of weeks since they began their migration.</p>

  <li> The number of butterflies 3 weeks after they began their migration.</li>
  <li> Create a graph that best represents the butterfly population. </li>
  <li> What is the vertical intercept of the graph? What does it tell you about the butterfly population? </li>
  <li> When does the butterfly population reach approximately 50,000? </li>
</ol>
<p>When you have the equation that represents the situation, you can substitute values in and use the order of operations to find the values for the table.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Part 1 is asking for the initial value. Since the equation \(p=100,000\cdot(\frac{4}{5})^w\) is in the form \(y=ab^x\), you know the initial value is \(a\) or 100,000. </li>
  <li> Part 2 is 1 week after migration, so replace the \(w\) in the equation with 1 to get 80,000. </li>
  <li>In part 3, the \(w\) can be replaced with 3 to get 51,200. </li>
  <li> The rest of the values of the table can be found the same way, and once you have the completed table, you can plot the points. Once you have plotted the points, you can connect them with a smooth curve. </li>
