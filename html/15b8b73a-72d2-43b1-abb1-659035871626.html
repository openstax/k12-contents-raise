<h4>Modeling a Quadratic Problem</h4>
<p>This activity challenges you to complete a very difficult task!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s review the information we know from the picture in the Self Check.</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> The picture measures 8 inches by 3 inches. </li>
  <li> There are 12 square inches of framing material. </li>
  <li> The frame must be uniform in width. </li>
  <li> All of the framing material must be used. </li>
  <li> The frame should not cover any part of the picture. </li>
</ul>
<p>What other information can you learn from the situation?</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> The perimeter of the picture is \(8 + 8 + 3 + 3\), or 22 inches. The framed picture will have a perimeter greater than this. </li>
  <li> If the picture is 8 inches by 3 inches, then the area of the picture is \(8 \cdot 3\), or 24 square inches. </li>
  <li> Since there are 12 square inches of framing material and all of it must be used, the framed picture will have an area of \(24 + 12\), or 36 square inches. </li>
</ul>
<p>The more you know about the situation, the closer you are to being able to solve this problem mathematically instead of guessing and checking to see if you are correct.</p>
<p>We will use this information in later activities to set up a quadratic equation that can be used to solve the problem.</p>

  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li>The perimeter of the picture is \(10 + 10 + 6 + 6 = 32\) inches.</li>

    <li>The area of the picture is \(10 \cdot 6 = 60\) square inches.</li>
