      <p>To help students consolidate and reflect on their work in the lesson, present the following scenario.

      </p>
      
        <p>Suppose a classmate who is absent today wanted to know:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What does it mean to &ldquo;solve for a variable&rdquo;?</li>
          <li>Why should we solve for a variable?</li>
          <li>How do we solve for a variable?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ask students: &ldquo;How would you respond to these questions and help your classmate catch up with what was missed?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Consider arranging students in groups of 2 and asking partners to do a role play, taking turns being the absent classmate and the explainer. Display the equations from the lesson for all to see. Encourage students to use 1 &ndash; 2 of them to demonstrate how to solve for a variable.</p>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
