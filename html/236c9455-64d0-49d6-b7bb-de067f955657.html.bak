<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Graph B. Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. The points in scatter plot B seem to follow the shape of a line of best fit. The points in scatter plot in A are very spread out.</p>

<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>Points to emphasize</h5>
<p>Unit 3 Project provides an additional opportunity to work with fitted lines.</p>
