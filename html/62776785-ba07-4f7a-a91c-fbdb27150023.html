<h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>
<div>
<p>An empty shipping box weighs 250 grams. The box is then filled with T-shirts. Each T-shirt weighs 132.5 grams. </p>
<p>The equation \( W = 250 + 132.5T \) represents the
    relationship between the quantities in this situation, where \( W \) is
    the weight, in grams, of the filled box and \( T \) the number of shirts
    in the box. </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>Name two possible solutions to the equation \( W = 250 + 132.5T \). What do the solutions mean in this situation?
    </li>
<li>Consider the equation \( 2,\!900 = 250 + 132.50T \). In this situation, what does the solution to this equation tell us?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Student Response</h3>
<div>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>For example:
      <ul>
<li>
          \( T=2 \) and \( W = 515 \)
        </li>
<li>
          \( T= 10 \) and \( W=1,\!575 \)
        </li>
<li>Each solution tells us the number of T-shirts in the box and the corresponding total weight in grams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It tells us the number of T-shirts in the box that result in a total weight of 2,900 grams.</li>

<h4>More Chances</h4>
  Lessons 1.8 and 1.9 provide more opportunities for
  discussion on solutions to two-variable equations and their meaning.
