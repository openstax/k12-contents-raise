<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>An empty shipping box weighs 250 grams. The box is then filled with T-shirts. Each T-shirt weighs 132.5 grams. </p>
<p>The equation \( W = 250 + 132.5T \) represents the
  relationship between the quantities in this situation, where \( W \) is
  the weight, in grams, of the filled box and \( T \) the number of shirts
  in the box. </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Name two possible solutions to the equation \( W = 250 + 132.5T \). What do the solutions mean in this situation?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(T=2\) and \(W=515\)
  </li>
  <li>\(T=10\) and \(W=1575\)
  </li>
</ul>

  <li>What do the solutions mean in this situation? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Each solution tells us the number of T-shirts in the box and the corresponding total weight
  in grams.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Consider the equation \( 2,\!900 = 250 + 132.50T \). In this situation, what does the solution to this equation
    tell us?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> It tells us the number of T-shirts in the box that results in a total weight of 2900 grams.
