<p>In this activity, whenever you see &#128172;, stop and share your responses with your partner. If you have different responses, try to come to a consensus.</p>
<p>Today you are going to investigate something called an interactive simulation. It is a tool that will help you visualize how area model multiplication works.</p>
<p>To begin, open the <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/area-model-algebra/latest/area-model-algebra_en.html?screens=1,2,3" target="_blank">Area Model Algebra</a> activity in your web browser. You will use it to complete this project.</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<p><li>What does the area of a rectangle have to do with multiplication? &#128172;</li></p>
</ol>


<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<p><li>Play with any of the screens on Area Model Algebra for 5 minutes. Write down two things you notice or have questions about, and one thing a neighbor noticed that is interesting to you. </li></p></ol>
