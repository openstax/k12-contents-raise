<p>In this activity, whenever you see &#128172;, stop and share your responses with your partner. If you have different responses, try to come to a consensus.</p>
<p>Today you are going to investigate something called an interactive simulation. It is a tool that will help you visualize how area model multiplication works.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/area-model-algebra/latest/area-model-algebra_en.html?screens=1,2,3" target="_blank">Open the interactive simulator</a>, Area Model Algebra in your web browser. You will use it to complete this project. It will look like the image above.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Play with any of the screens on Area Model Algebra for 5 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Complete the following questions.</p>



<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<p><li>What does the area of a rectangle have to do with multiplication? &#128172;</li></p>
</ol>


<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<p><li>Write down two things you notice or have questions about, and one thing a neighbor noticed that is interesting to you. </li></p></ol>
