<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This task reminds students that they can use a graph of a function to gain information about the situation that the function models.</p>
<p>Every question can be answered, or at least estimated, by analyzing the graph. As students work, look for those who use the given equation to solve or verify the answers. For example, the first question can be answered by evaluating \(h(1)\) and the second question by evaluating \(h(8)\). Invite them to share their strategy during synthesis.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Given their earlier work on quadratic functions, students should be familiar with projectiles. If needed, give a brief orientation on the context. Tell students that there are devices that use compressed air or other means to generate a great amount of force and launch a potato or similar-sized object.</p>
<p>Read the problem as a class. Allow students to answer the exercises individually.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>A mechanical device is used to launch a potato vertically into the air. The potato is launched from a platform 20 feet above the ground, with an initial vertical velocity of 92 feet per second.</p>
<p>The function \(h(t) = -16t^2 + 92t + 20\) models the height of the potato over the ground, in feet, \(t\) seconds after launch.</p>
<p>Here is the graph representing the function.</p>
<p><img height="160" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/7987a9a117ab1d27d4fef5445d812c1549ecb425" width="273"></p>
<p>For each question, explain your reasoning.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>What is the height of the potato 1 second after launch? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The height of the potato 1 second after launch will be 96 feet.<br>
  Substituting 1 second into the function \(h(t)\) yields:</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}h(1)&amp;=&amp;-16{(1)}^2+20\\&amp;=&amp;-16+92+20\\&amp;=&amp;96\end{array}\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li>Will the potato still be in the air 8 seconds after launch? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, from the graph, we can see the potato will land before 8 seconds after the launch. </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
<li>Will the potato reach 120 feet? If so, when will it happen? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, from the graph, we can see the potato&rsquo;s height will be 120 feet at two times: approximately 1.5 seconds and 4.3 seconds after launch. </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
<li>When will the potato hit the ground, or have a height of zero feet? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> We can see from the graph the potato will hit the ground, or have a height of zero feet, after approximately 6 seconds.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Focus the discussion on how students used the graph to help them answer the questions. Encourage students to use precise mathematical vocabulary in their explanation. Invite students, especially those who do not rely solely on the graph, to share their responses and reasoning.</p>
<p>Point out that we can gather quite a bit of information about the function from the graph, but the information may not be precise.</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li>&ldquo;Is there a way to get more exact answers rather than estimates?&rdquo; (Some questions can be answered by evaluating the function. For questions that are not easy to calculate at this point, we can only estimate from the graph.) </li>
<li>&ldquo;Which questions in the activity could be answered by calculating?&rdquo; (The first two questions, about where the potato is after some specified number of seconds.)&nbsp; </li>
<li>&ldquo;Which questions were not as easy to figure out by calculation?&rdquo; (Those about when the potato reaches certain heights.) </li>
<li>&ldquo;How can we verify the time when the potato is 120 feet above the ground or when, exactly, it hits the ground?&rdquo; (We can find the \(t\) values that make \(h(t)\) equal 120 by looking at the graph and then evaluating the function at those values of \(t\). To find exactly when the potato hits the ground, we would need to find the zeros of \(h\) by solving the equation \(h(t)=0\).) </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell students that, in this unit, they will investigate how answers to these questions could be calculated rather than estimated from a graph or approximated by guessing and checking.</p>
