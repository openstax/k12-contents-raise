  they sleep in a 24-hour period. Display a graphic organizer such as shown.</p>

<p>Ask students to decide whether each value or set of values described in the first column could be in the domain and
  in the range of the function. They should be prepared to explain their decisions (some of which may depend on the
  assumptions they made about the situation).</p>
<p>Once the class completes the organizer (an example is shown here), give students a moment to come up with a holistic
  description of the domain and range of this function.</p>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
