<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Find missing terms in a geometric sequence.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities </strong>that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
    4.14.1: What Are the Patterns?
  </li>
<ul>
<li>
      In this activity, you noticed and wondered about the patterns and characteristics of different sequences.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<li>
    4.14.2: Using Tables and Graphs to Represent Geometric Sequences
  </li>
<ul>
<li>
      In this activity, you used tables and graphs to recognize a sequence and find the next term. You learned that geometric sequences can get larger or smaller.
    </li>
</ul>
<li>
    4.14.2: Self Check&nbsp;
  </li>
<li>
    4.14.3: Complete the Sequence
  </li>
<ul>
<li>
      In this activity, you worked to complete the geometric sequences by filling in the blanks. You used a common ratio to find the pattern to complete the sequence.
    </li>
</ul>
<li>
    4.14.3: Self Check&nbsp;
  </li>
<li>
    4.14.4: Connecting the Common Ratio and the Term in a Sequence
  </li>
<ul>
<li>
      In this activity, you summarized what you learned in the lesson by explaining why a sequence is geometric and how you are able to find the next term.
    </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
    4.14.5: Practice
  </li>
