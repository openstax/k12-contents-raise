<p dir="ltr">Graph D.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="Graph of line, no grid, origin O. &nbsp;Each axis from negative 10 to 10, by 5's. The line passes through negative 10 comma 10, 0 comma 0, 5 comma negative 5.

    <p>Your answers may vary,, but here are some samples.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Graph  A is the only set of graphs that represents a system of equations. It is the only system with exactly one solution.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Graph  B is the only set of graphs that represents a system of inequalities with no solutions.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Graph  C is the only set of graphs in which the boundaries are horizontal and vertical lines. It is the only one representing a system with an infinite number of solutions.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Graph  D is the only graph that does not represent a system. It only represents one inequality.</li>
