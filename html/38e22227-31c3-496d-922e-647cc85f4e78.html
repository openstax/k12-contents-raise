<ul>
<li>A is the only set of graphs that represents a system of equations. It is the only system with exactly one solution.&nbsp;</li>
<li>B is the only set of graphs that represents a system of inequalities with no solutions.&nbsp;</li>
<li>C is the only set of graphs in which the boundaries are horizontal and vertical lines. It is the only one representing a system with an infinite number of solutions.&nbsp;</li>
<li>D is the only graph that does not represent a system. It only represents one inequality.</li>
