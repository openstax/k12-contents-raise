<p>In this lesson, you will again be working with the quadratic formula. You will begin to analyze how it produces solutions to any quadratic equation and how it relates to completing the square.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Explain the steps and complete some missing steps for deriving the quadratic formula. </li>
  <li> Explain how the quadratic formula is related to the process of completing the square for a quadratic equation \(ax^2+bx+c=0\). </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
