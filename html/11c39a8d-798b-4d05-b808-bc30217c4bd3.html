<h3>Project Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>In the Numbers Screen activity, students will explore an arithmetic function using the terms “input” and “output.” As students build a function, the equation representation updates dynamically and includes a simplified representation. Students can observe the resulting outputs as in the previous activity, and as an explicit table of ordered pairs. <br><br>

  In the Equations Screen activity, students build on their experiences by shifting from “input” and “output” to “x” and “y” and adding the representation of a graph for the function values. This permits students to wonder and explore how changing different parameters in the function will impact the outputs, the table of values, and the graph. </p>

<h3>Launch</h3>
<p><li>Circulate as students work on part 3. If some groups seem behind, offer assistance if they have questions. </li></p>
<p><li>After 5 minutes or so, give students a time update that they should be on to #4.  </li></p>
<p><li>When groups have finished, bring the class together for a whole-class discussion. Have four different students share their responses to #6.</li></p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Sample equation: \(Output = \frac{Input}{2} + 2\)</p>


<p><li> What is the output when the input is 10? Switch papers
  with a teammate and check that you found the correct
  output. &#128172;</li></p>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
  <p>Response using sample equation listed above: \(7 = \frac{10}{2} + 2\)</p>

  <p><li>
      Describe how to find the output for your function if given
      any input. <strong> Challenge yourself to describe in multiple ways. </strong>
    </li>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>
    Response using sample equation listed above: Divide the input by two and then add two. Two more than half the input. Etc.
</p>
<p>    For questions 4-8, use the simulation screen labeled “Equations”. Note the tabs located above and below the function builder.</p>

<p><li>What does your graph look like? What other graphs can you make? </li></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>I can make a line. I can only make lines with this function.</p>

<p><li>Briefly describe how different operations impact the graph of your function.</li></p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
  <li>Addition
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>The addition operation impacted the graph by moving it up or down. Adding more makes the graph move up.</p>
  </li>
  
  
  <li>Subtraction
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>The subtraction operation impacted the graph by moving it up or down. Subtracting more makes the graph move down.</p>
  </li>
  
  
  <li>Multiplication
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>The multiplication operation impacted the graph by changing how steep the line was and whether it increased or decreased (moving from left to right on the graph). Multiplying more makes the graph steeper up and down.</p>
  </li>
  
  
  <li>Division
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>The division operation impacted the graph by changing how steep the line was and whether it increased or decreased (moving to the right on the graph). Dividing more makes the graph flatter.</p>

<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>
  Ask students to answer the following question on an exit ticket. Review after class to determine student misunderstandings and address in a subsequent day's warm up. <br>
  1.    What is a function?<br>
  2.    What are the different ways a function can be represented? 
</p>

<p>Sample student responses: </p>
<p>A function describes the relationship between an input and an output. Every input has a single output, no matter how many times you put it through the function. Different inputs could have the same output though. A function is a rule that takes an input, does something to it, and makes an output.</p> 
<p>A function can be represented with words, table of values, list of points, a graph, or an equation.</p>

<h4>Extension </h4>
  
  <p>Play with the game! Challenge yourself to figure out the mystery functions. They get tricky when you have two or three operations. Does your rule match the simulation's rule? Can there be more than one answer? </p>
