<h4>More Complex Quadratic Patterns</h4>
<p>See Steps 1 – 3 of a pattern of squares below. Write an equation representing the relationship between the step
  number \(n\) and the number of squares \(y\).</p>
<p><img alt="A pattern of squares. Step 1 has two columns of squares in two rows, but there are only two squares. In the first column, the square is located in the top row. In the second column, the square is located in the bottom row. It makes the squares look like they are in a diagonal pattern with the bottom left square and the top right square missing. Step 2 has 3 columns of squares. In the first column, there are 2 squares. In the second column, there are 3 squares. The squares are aligned to the top of the squares in the previous column so it looks like a square is missing from the first column. Then, in the last column, there are only 2 squares. The squares in this last column align to the bottom of the squares in the previous column so it looks like there is a square missing from the top of the column. Step 3 has 4 columns of squares. The first column contains 3 squares and the next two columns contain 4 squares. The columns are arranged such that they all start at the same level so it looks like a square is missing from the first column. Then, in the last column there are 3 squares. The squares in this column align with the bottom of the previous two columns so it looks like there is a square missing from the top of the column." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="106" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/0e7561018baf1cc33887cea2b04dfb9eb48001fb" width="300"/></p>
<p>First, try to find the pattern if the missing squares were actually there.</p>
<p>Make a table:</p>
<table class="os-raise-wideequaltable">
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col"> Step </th>
<th scope="col"> # of columns </th>
<th scope="col"> # of rows </th>
<th scope="col"> # of squares </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> 1 </td>
<td> 2 </td>
<td> 2 </td>
<td> 2 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 2 </td>
<td> 2 </td>
<td> 2 </td>
<td> 7 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 3 </td>
<td> 4 </td>
<td> 4 </td>
<td> 14 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> \(n\) </td>
<td> \(n + 1\) </td>
<td> \(n + 1\) </td>
<td> \((n+1)^2-2\) </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br/>
<p>There would be \((n+1)(n+1)\) squares, but there are 2 missing from each step, so the equation would be:</p>
<p>\(y=(n+1)^2-2\).</p>

<p>The number of columns is always \(n+3\), and the number of rows is \(n+3\).</p>
<p>The number of squares will be represented by \(y=(n+3)^2\).</p>
