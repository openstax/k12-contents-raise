<p>In this lesson, you will learn how to work with sequences and describe them recursively in an informal way. You will see how sequences are used to accomplish recurring tasks.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Give examples of a sequence. </li>
  <li> Explain the meaning of the term &ldquo;sequence.&rdquo; </li>
  <li> Explain the meaning of the term &ldquo;term,&rdquo; as it is used in a mathematical sequence. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the<strong> activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 4.13.1: Describe the Pattern </li>
  <li> 4.13.2: What Is a Sequence? </li>
  <ul>
    <li> 4.13.2: Self Check </li>
    <li> 4.13.2: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 4.13.3: The Connection Between Sequences and Terms </li>
  <ul>
    <li> 4.13.3: Self Check </li>
    <li> 4.13.3: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 4.13.4: Rules for a Sequence </li>
</ul>
<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>
