<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity prompts students to look at how the slope in slope-intercept form affects the graph of a linear function. Circulate to ensure students are graphing their lines properly. If necessary, partner students during the graphing process.</p>
<p>In pairs, students should discuss the vertical shifts to the parent function, \(f(x)=x\), to graph the new functions.</p>
<h4> Launch</h4>
<p>Allow students to work in pairs to check each other&rsquo;s graphs and discuss the relationships to answer the questions. During class discussion, solicit a pair for each question to describe the effects the different slopes have on the graphs.</p>
<p>For students who can benefit from a more accessible model, use geoboards and rubber bands. Use one color rubber band for the \(x\)- and \(y\)-axes. Use a different color for each line graphed. Work with students to count spots on the geoboard and discuss the graphs and their relationships.</p>

  <li>Compare the equations of lines \(f-h\) to the graphs of lines \(b-d\). What changed with the equations of these functions?</li>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="8">
  <li>Compare the graphs of lines \(f-h\) to the graphs of lines \(b-d\). How did the change in their equations affect their graphs?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Since there is a negative coefficient, the graphs of lines \(f-h\) are reflections of the positive versions of the lines over the x-axis. The graphs were vertically “flipped.”</p>
<br>

<p>In the equation \(f(x)=ax\), the \(a\) is acting as the vertical stretch or compression of the parent function. It dilates the graph. When \(a\) is negative, there is also a vertical reflection of the graph.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Multiplying the equation of \(f(x)=x\) by \(a\) vertically stretches or expands the graph of \(f\) by a factor of \(a\) units if \(a > 1\).</li>
  <li>The \(a\) vertically compresses the graph of \(f\) by a factor of \(a\) units if \(0 \leq a \leq 1\).</li>
  <li>This means the larger the absolute value of \(a\), the steeper the slope.</li>

<p>In \(f(x)=mx+b\), the \(m\) acts as the vertical dilation (stretch or compression factor). This is a type of transformation to the graph of \(f(x)=x\).</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The same points are in both functions. The lines appear to be exactly the same.</p>

<br>

<p>Horizontal dilations that stretch and compress linear functions are difficult to identify from graphs because they can appear as if they are vertical dilations. However, they are different because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The changes to the function are applied to the input values of a function when the transformation is a horizontal dilation.</li>
  <li>The changes to the function are applied to the output values of a function when the transformation is a vertical dilation.</li>

<h4>Transformations of Linear Functions</h4>
<p>Given the equation of a linear function, use transformations to graph the linear function in the form \(f(x)=mx+b\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Graph \(f(x)=x\). </li>
  <li> Vertically stretch or compress the graph by a factor \(m\). </li>
  <li> Shift the graph up or down \(b\) units. </li>
</ol>
<p>Graph \(f(x)= \frac12 x&minus;3\) using transformations.</p>
<p>The equation for the function shows that \(m=\frac12 \), so the identity function is vertically compressed by \(\frac12\). The equation for the function also shows that \(b=&minus;3\), so the identity function is vertically shifted down 3 units. First, graph the identity function, and show the vertical compression as in Figure 16.</p>

The second shows an increasing function of y = x and runs through the points (0, 0) and (1, 1))." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/d5621b67f6db03da1c64ec9b78f685850687e2a2"></p>
<p>This graph shows two functions on an \((x, y)\) coordinate plane. One shows an increasing function of \(y = x\) divided by 2 that runs through the points \((0, 0)\) and \((2, 1)\). The second shows an increasing function of \(y = x\) and runs through the points \((0, 0)\) and \((1, 1)\).</p>
<p>Now, show the vertical shift:</p>
<p><img alt="This graph shows two functions on an x, y coordinate plane. The first is an increasing function of y = x divided by 2 and runs through the points (0, 0) and (2, 1).  The second shows an increasing function of y = x divided by 2 minus 3 and passes through the points (0, 3) and (2, -2).  An arrow pointing downward from the first function  to the second function reveals the vertical shift." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/fa6330d94e6f7cd4b4fcc0bd7d135a06f1c34dd2"></p>
<p>This graph shows two functions on an \((x, y)\) coordinate plane. The first is an increasing function of \(y = x\) divided by 2 and runs through the points \((0, 0)\) and \((2, 1)\). The second shows an increasing function of \(y = x\) divided by 2 minus 3 and passes through the points \((0, 3)\) and \((2, -2)\). An arrow pointing downward from the first function to the second function reveals the vertical shift.</p>
<p><strong>Can we sketch a graph by reversing the order of the transformations?</strong></p>
<p>No. The order of the transformations follows the order of operations. When the function is evaluated at a given input, the corresponding output is calculated by following the order of operations. So, the stretch was performed before the vertical shift.</p>
<br>
<h4>Try It: Transformations of Linear Functions</h4>
<p>Name the transformations to go from the parent function, \(f(x)=x\), to \(f(x)=4+2x\).</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Here is how to determine the transformations:</p>
<p>First, the slope, \(m=2\), tells that there is a vertical stretch of 2.</p>
<p>Next, the \(y\)-intercept is 4, so there is a vertical shift up 4.</p>
