<p>To highlight the idea that adding equal amounts to the two sides of a true equation keeps the equation true, display this system for all to see:</p>
<p>\( \left\{ \begin{array}{c l} -2x+8y=20\\ 2x+y=7 \end{array}\right. \)</p>
<p>Ask students if there is a pair of \( x \)- and \( y \)-values that makes both equations true. Once students suggest \( (2,3) \) as the solution, use graphing technology to graph the equations and verify the solution. Display the graph for all to see.</p>
<p>Survey the class to see who has solved the system by adding the left side of each equation (\( 2x+y \) and \(&nbsp;-2x+8y \)) and then adding the right side (7 and 20). (Most or all students are likely to have done this.) Then, discuss with students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Why is it okay to add an expression, \(&nbsp;2x+y&nbsp;\), to one side of the first equation, but add a number, 7, to the other side?&rdquo; (Because \( 2x+y \) and 7 are equal)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;What is the new equation?&rdquo; \( (9y=27) \) &ldquo;Does the pair \( (2,3) \) still make this equation true?&rdquo; (Yes. Graph this equation to illustrate that it intersects the original graphs at the same point.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Suppose we add 7 to the left side of the first equation and \( 2x+y \) to the right side. What is the new equation?&rdquo; (\(-2x+8y+7=20+2x+y \)) &ldquo;Would the same pair of \( x \)- and \( y \)-values still work?&rdquo; (Yes. Display the graph of the new equation so students could see that the new line intersects at the same point. Students could also verify by substitution.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Suppose that, instead of adding, we subtract 7 from the left side and subtract \( 2x+y \) from the right side. What is the new equation?&rdquo; (\( -2x+8-7=20-2x-y \)). &ldquo;Would the same pair of \( x \)- and \( y \)-values still work?&rdquo; (Yes. Graph the new equation to show that this line, too, intersects at the same point. Or students could verify by substitution.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Why does the new equation still give the same solution even though we didn&rsquo;t add the numbers or expressions from the same side of each equation?&rdquo; (If the two sides of an equation are equal, it doesn&rsquo;t matter which side of one equation is added to which side of another equation. The new equation will stay balanced.)</li>
