<p>In this lesson, you will use your knowledge of geometric patterns to create tables and graphs that will represent the area of a garden.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Create drawings, tables, and graphs that represent the area of a garden. </li>
  <li> Recognize a situation represented by a graph that increases and then decreases. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the<strong> activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 7.1.1: Noticing New Patterns of Change </li>
