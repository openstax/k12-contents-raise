<h4>Cool Down Activity</h4>
<p>You have seen that you can use either the slope-intercept form or the point-slope form to find an equation of a line. Which form you use will depend on the information you are given.</p>
<p>The table can be used as a reference.</p>

      <li>One partner chooses an Equation slip from the pile. Decide if the equation represents a line through the points on your Points slip. If it does, explain to your partner how you know. Keep the slip. If it does not represent a line through your points, give the Equation slip to your partner.</li>
      <li>Your partner should verify the equation represents a line through the points on your partner&rsquo;s Points slip. Discuss and reach an agreement. If the equation does not represent a line through either partner&rsquo;s points, set it aside.</li>
      <li>Take turns choosing Equation slips until they are all gone. (There are 6 Equation slips.) Each partner should end with a total of 2 Equation slips that match. There will be 2 Equations slips that do not match either set of points.</li>
