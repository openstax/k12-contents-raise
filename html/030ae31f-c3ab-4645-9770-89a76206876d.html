<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>In earlier activities, students wrote expressions to describe visual patterns by first creating tables and reasoning
  repeatedly about how the pattern changes at incrementally greater step numbers. Here they write an equation to
  describe a pattern without creating a table of values. They look more directly at the structure of the visual pattern
  and its connections to the parts of the equations, and then they reason in the other direction: given an equation,
  they generate a visual pattern. Students also begin to frame the relationship between the quantities as a function
  with inputs and outputs leading to a definition of quadratic function.</p>
<p>Some students are likely to view the nth step of the given pattern as an \(n\)-by-\(n\) square with four small
  squares added at the corners, leading to the expression \(n^2+4\) for the total number of small squares. Others may
  view this as an \(n+2\) by \(n+2\) square with 4 rectangles removed, each consisting of \(n\) squares. The latter
  leads to the (equivalent) expression \((n+2)^2-4n\). In the next activity, students will look closely at how
  equivalent expressions arise when analyzing geometric patterns, but if equivalent expressions come up in this
  activity, consider inviting students to share them.</p>
<p>This prompt gives students opportunities to see and make use of structure when writing an equation from a visual
  pattern. The specific structure they might notice is an inner square with a side length equal to the step number along
  with a small square on each corner. Later, generating a pattern given an equation requires them to reason abstractly
  and concretely.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Give students a moment to observe the pattern from the activity and ask them what they notice and what they wonder.
  Then, ask students to sketch the next step in the pattern and share their sketch with a partner.</p>

  </ol>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution </strong>button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Step 5 is a collection of 25 small squares, in a 5-by-5 arrangement, surrounded by 4 other
  small squares at the corners. Step 18 is a collection of \(18^2\) small squares, in an 18 by 18 arrangement,
  surrounded by 4 other small squares at the corners.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Step 5: 29, because it is \(5^2+4\) or \((5 \cdot 5)+4\). Step 18: 328, because it is
  \(18^2+4\) or \((18 \cdot 18)+4\).</p>

<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> For the original step pattern in the statement, \(y=n^2+4\), write an equation to represent the relationship
    between the step number, \(n\), and the perimeter, \(P\). <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(P=4n+16\)
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li> For the step pattern you created in Part 3 of the activity, \(y=n^2-1\), write an equation to represent the
    relationship between the step number, \(n\), and the perimeter, \(P\). <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> If the pattern was an \(n\)-by-\(n\) array of squares with a square missing from the
    corner, the perimeter could be given by \(P=0\) when \(n=1\), and by \(P=4n\) when \(n&gt;1\).
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li> Are these linear functions? <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer: </strong>Yes, in both cases, these are linear functions
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may wonder how to draw a pattern given the equation \(y=n^2-1\). Show them the warm up problems where
  they subtracted 1 to remove the small square in Figure B and added 1 when there was an extra small square in Figure C.
  Prompt them to describe subtracting 1 as removing one small square from each step. Some students may find it easier to
  start drawing Step 2 or Step 3. They can work backward to draw Step 1, which would have 0 squares since \(1^2-1=0\).
  Emphasize that making a table can help them figure out exactly how many small squares are needed in each step.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Make sure students see the connection between the equation \(y=n^2+4\) and the composition of the squares in the
  pattern: that regardless of what \(n\) is, the figure at Step \(n\) is composed of a square that is \(n\) by \(n\),
  plus 4 small squares (1 at each corner).</p>
<p>Next, help students relate the work so far to the idea of functions. Discuss with students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;In each pattern we&rsquo;ve seen, is the relationship between the step number and the number of squares a
    function? How do you know?&rdquo; (Yes. The step number is the input, and the number of squares is the output. For
    every step number, there is a particular number of squares.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;How can the relationship be expressed using function notation?&rdquo; (If the function \(f\) gives the
    number of squares at Step \(n\), we can define it as \(f(n)=n^2+4\).) </li>
</ul>
<p>Introduce quadratic function as a function that is defined by a quadratic expression. Like other functions, it can be
  represented with an equation, a table of values, a graph, and a description.</p>
