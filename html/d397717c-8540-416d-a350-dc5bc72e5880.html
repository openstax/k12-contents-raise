<h4> Domain and Range as Inequalities</h4>
<p>Looking at the linear function below, use inequalities to represent the domain and range.</p>

<p>Domain:</p>
<p>Since the domain is all \(x\)-values, look left to right for the least to greatest values.</p>
<p>The smallest \(x\)-value on this linear function is 5, and then the line continues to the right forever.</p>
<p>So, the domain is all values that are at least 5.</p>
<p>As an inequality, write this as \(x\geq5\).</p>
<p>Range:</p>
<p>Since the range is all \(y\)-values, look from the bottom to the top for the least to greatest values.</p>
<p>The smallest \(y\)-value is 0, and then the line continues up forever.</p>
<p>So, the range is all values that are at least 0.</p>
<p>An an inequality, the range is \(y\geq0\).</p>

<p>Here is how to write the domain and range of the linear function as an inequality:</p>
<p>Domain:</p>
<p>Since the domain is all \(x\)-values, look left to right for the least to greatest values.</p>
<p>The smallest \(x\)-value on this linear function is 5, and then the line continues to the right forever.</p>
<p>So, the domain is all values that are at least 5.</p>
<p>As an inequality, write this as \(x\geq5\).</p>
<p>Range:</p>
<p>Since the range is all \(y\)-values, look from the bottom to the top for the least to greatest values.</p>
<p>The smallest \(y\)-value is 6, and then the line continues up forever.</p>
<p>So, the range is all values that are at least 6.</p>
<p>An an inequality, the range is \(y\geq6\).</p>
