<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>The purpose of this Math Talk is to elicit strategies and understandings students have for
    subtracting an estimated value from an actual value. These understandings help students develop fluency and will be
    helpful later in this lesson when students will need to be able to compute residuals from a linear model.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Ask students, &ldquo;How would the answers to these two questions be different?&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Actual value: 21 cars. Estimated value: 20 cars</li>
  <li>Actual value: 20 cars. Estimated value: 21 cars</li>
</ul>
<p>(The first question has an answer of 1 car. The second question has an answer of \(-1\) car.)</p>
<p>Display one problem at a time. Give students quiet time to think individually for each problem and ask them
  to give a signal when they have an answer and a strategy. Keep all problems displayed throughout the talk. Follow with
  a whole-class discussion.</p>

  <h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>
  <p><em>Representation: Internalize Comprehension. </em>To support working memory, provide students with
    sticky notes or mini whiteboards.<br><em>Supports accessibility for: Conceptual processing; Memory</em></p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Mentally calculate how close the estimate is to the actual value using the difference:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>actual value &minus; estimated value.</em></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" >
  <li>Actual value: 24.8 grams. Estimated value: 19.6 grams
  <p><strong>Answer: </strong>5.2 grams</p>  
  </li>
  <li>Actual value: $112.11. Estimated value: $109.30
    <p><strong>Answer: </strong>$2.81</p>  
  </li>
  <li>Actual value: 41.5 centimeters. Estimated value: 45.90 centimeters
    <p><strong>Answer: </strong>\(-4.4\) centimeters</p>  
  </li>
  <li>Actual value: \(-1.34\) degrees Celsius. Estimated value: \(-2.45\) degrees Celsius
    <p><strong>Answer: </strong>1.11 degrees Celsius</p>  
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Ask students to share their strategies for each problem. Record and display their responses for all to see.
  To involve more students in the conversation, consider asking:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Who can restate _______&rsquo;s reasoning in a different way?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Did anyone have the same strategy but would explain it differently?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Did anyone solve the problem in a different way?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Does anyone want to add on to _______&rsquo;s strategy?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Do you agree or disagree? Why?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

  <h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
  <p><em>Speaking: MLR8 Discussion Supports. </em>Display sentence frames to support students when they
    explain their strategy. For example: &ldquo;First, I _____ because . . . .&rdquo; or &ldquo;I noticed _____ so I . .
    . .&rdquo; Some students may benefit from the opportunity to rehearse what they will say with a partner before they
    share with the whole class.</p>
