<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students contrast two patterns of dots: one pattern shows a linear change, and the other shows a
  quadratic change. They analyze the visual patterns and represent them using tables of values, expressions, and graphs.
</p>
<p>The chosen quadratic pattern enables students to easily see the “squaring” of one quantity: visually, in
  the way the dots are arranged, and numerically, in the values in the table (1, 4, 9, etc.). They also notice that when
  the points representing the relationship are plotted, they form a curve. The term “quadratic” will be
  introduced in the next activity.</p>
<p>Students reason repeatedly about the number of dots at different step numbers and then generalize their observations
  with variable expressions. They look for and make use of structure to extend the visual patterns. If students opt to
  use a spreadsheet or graphing technology, they practice choosing appropriate tools strategically.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Some students may choose to use a spreadsheet tool to study the pattern and subsequently to use graphing technology
  to plot the data. Make these tools accessible, in case they are requested.</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
<li>Explain why the graphs of the two patterns look the way they do.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Answer:</strong> The points representing the first pattern lie on a line because getting from one step to
    the next involves adding the same number of dots (2 dots). The points representing the second pattern do not lie on
    a line. They “curve” upward because the number of dots added at each step increases from step to step.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to describe how they see the number of dots change in each pattern. Focus the discussion on the
  connections between students’ descriptions, the changes in the table, and the graphs. Make sure these points are
  uncovered in the discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li> For the first pattern, each successive step adds two dots. The growth is constant. The points on the graph form a
    straight line. </li>
<li> For the second pattern, the number of dots that is added changes (and grows) at each step. As a result, the
    number of dots for the second pattern curves upward when graphed. </li>
</ul>
<p>Highlight that, in the second pattern, the expression for the number of dots at Step \(n\) can be expressed as
  \(n^2\), which can be read as “\(n\) squared.” Point out that the “squaring” is also evident
  in the visual pattern.</p>

<h4>Writing Expressions for Patterns</h4>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 1</p>
<p><img alt="A pattern of squares. Step 1 has 3 rows of squares. The top row has 1 square, the middle row has 3 squares, the bottom row has 1 square. They are shaped like a plus sign. Step 2 has 4 rows of squares. The top row has 1 square, the second row has 4 squares, the third row has 4 squares, the last row has 1 square. The squares in the top and bottom row are aligned above and below the second squares in rows 2 and 3, respectively. Step 3 has 5 rows. The top row has 1 square, row 2 has 5 squares, row 3 has 5 squares, row 4 has 5 squares, and the bottom row has 1 square. The squares in the top and bottom row are aligned above and below the second squares in rows 2 and 4, respectively." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="238" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/0a1a836e44bf7cd832a0d520642fc03dad9e66c3" width="550"/></p>
<p>Find the number of squares in Step 5:</p>
<p>First, look to see the pattern. Every step, another row and another column are added, plus the two extra squares.</p>
<ul>
<li> Step 1: 1 row of \(3 + 2\) </li>
<li> Step 2: 2 rows of \(4 +2\) </li>
<li> Step 3: 3 rows of \(5 + 2\) </li>
</ul>
<p>So the width is always 1 by \(n\), or \(n\). The length is \(n+2\), and then another 2 is added.</p>
<p>Then, draw pictures or create a table:</p>
