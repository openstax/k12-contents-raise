<h4>Activity (20 Minutes)</h4>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in pairs or groups, if necessary, so they have access to Desmos. If possible, allow students to work individually so that each understands the steps necessary to find the correlation coefficient of a data set.</p>
<p>After students open a window to Desmos, instruct them to click into each cell in the table and insert each corresponding value in the data set. Once a student has clicked into the first cell in the table, they may also use the arrow keys to navigate from one cell to the next.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instructions are provided if they wish to copy and paste the entire table, but emphasize that unless the values are copied from a spreadsheet, they will not be pasted together into the table.</p>
<p>Show students that the graphing window, or field of view, may be changed by clicking onto the graph and dragging it in different directions.</p>
<br>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" >
  <li> Click on the &quot;\(+\)&quot; sign and choose to add a table in the Desmos graphing tool. This will generate a table for entering a data set. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Desmos: Correlation Data Set Table</strong></p>
<p>Students were provided access to Desmos.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answers may vary</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent"  start="2">
  <li> Enter the data set shown in the table below into the corresponding \(x_1\) and \(y_1\) columns. </li>
</ol>
<p>(If preferred, the data can be copied and pasted into Desmos from a spreadsheet using keyboard shortcuts. Windows: Ctrl+C for copy and Ctrl+V for paste. Mac: Command+C for copy and Command+V for paste.)</p>
<table class="os-raise-skinnytable">

<p>The window should be appropriately set to display the points in the table, but sometimes it will be necessary to adjust the window of the graph in order to properly view your data set. Use the mouse to drag and change the viewing window. To zoom in or out, use the buttons in the top right or the scrolling wheel on the mouse.</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent"  start="3">
  <li> Hit return to enter a new item. Enter the command corr(\(x_1, y_1\)). You do not have to enter anything special to get the subscripts to appear – simply type \(x\) and then 1 and it will automatically fill in \(x_1\).&nbsp; </li>
</ol>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent"  start="4">
  <li> A number between -1 and 1 will appear after an equal sign in the bottom right-hand corner of the same box. What is the number rounded to the thousandths place? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> -0.948</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent"  start="5">
  <li> What does this number tell you about the strength of the linear relationship? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> These data have a strong negative linear relationship. This means that as the \(x\)-values increase, the \(y\)-values decrease.</p>
<br>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>If students are having difficulty finding the correlation coefficient using technology, tell them to use the corr\((x_1, y_1\)) command in Desmos. It may also be helpful to check the accuracy of the data entered into the \(x_1\) and \(y_1\)columns.</p>
<p>Tell students, in this lesson, we will find the correlation coefficient of a data set using technology. We will then use the correlation coefficient to understand the strength of a linear relationship.</p>

    <tr>
      <td>\( r = 0.987 \)</td>

    <tr>
      <td>\( r = 0.975 \)</td>
      <td>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: This is the value of \(r^2\). Take the square root to find \(r\). The answer is \( r= -0.987 \). </td>

<h4>Finding The Correlation Coefficient Using Technology</h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s find the correlation coefficient for a given data set.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Click the \(+\) symbol in the top left and select a table.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Enter the data set as shown. Press Enter.</p>

<table class="os-raise-skinnytable">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">\(x_1\)</th>
      <th scope="col">\(y_1\)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>-6</td>
      <td>-1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-4</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>-2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>-3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<p>The data set will populate the graph as shown here.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - On the left side, click in box #2 for a new item. Enter the command corr(\(x_1, y_1\)). Remember from the activity that Desmos will automatically place the 1 as subscript after an \(x\) or a \(y\).</p>
<p>As soon as you enter the correlation command, Desmos will display the correlation coefficient after an equal sign in the bottom right corner of the same box.</p>

<br>
    <br>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Round to the nearest thousandth. The correlation coefficient is -0.299.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Determine the strength of the linear relationship. This correlation coefficient shows a weak negative linear relationship.</p>
