<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>The goal of this lesson is to encounter two different growth patterns&mdash;one pattern is linear, and the other is exponential, though students don&rsquo;t need to use those words yet. Students think about and compare the patterns by performing calculations and using graphs. This lesson contains many opportunities for students to notice and make use of structure, for example, noticing that \(1,000+200+200+200+200\) can be expressed as \(1,000+200 \cdot 4\), which is useful when they must add on more and more 200s. There is also an opportunity to use appropriate tools strategically, for example, if students choose to use a spreadsheet to perform many iterations of such calculations.</p>
<p>They see that the pattern that grows by repeatedly doubling starts off slowly but eventually overtakes the other pattern, which increases by repeatedly adding the same amount. In fact, the first pattern eventually leaves the second pattern far behind. It is important that the teacher makes the connections between linear and exponential growth and the real world. Students need to understand how exponential growth can affect them financially through debts and investments, and how it&rsquo;s always important to compare different offers given.</p>
<p>Students continue to examine two types of patterns by looking at tables, noting that one type is characterized by common differences and the other by common factors. They then match different representations with two contexts. This is an opportunity for students to notice structure in expressions. Note we are still not expecting students to use the words <em>linear</em> or <em>exponential</em> to describe these patterns, though they may naturally use the word <em>linear</em> to describe linear growth since they have encountered these types of functions before.</p>
<p>Throughout the unit, students will study exponential patterns systematically (eventually viewing them as functions) before returning to this comparison with linear functions toward the end of the unit.</p>
<p>Some technology is required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to select appropriate technology in the lesson. We recommend making scientific calculators and spreadsheet technology available.</p>
