<p>Sketch this graph, then sketch a graph of \(y=x^2+5x\) on the same graph. Briefly explain how you know where to sketch the graph.</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x^2+5x\) is equivalent to \(x(x+5)\), so the \(x\)-intercepts are at \(x=0\) and \(x=-5\). Calculate the vertex by finding the \(x\)-coordinate in between \(x = -5\) and \(x = 0\) which is \(x = -2.5\). Substitute \(x=-2.5\) into the equation to find the \(y\)-coordinate: \(y=(-2.5)2+5(-2.5)=-6.188\). The vertex is at \((-2.5, -6.188)\). The squared term has a positive coefficient so the graph opens upward. Adding a positive linear term to \(x^2\) shifts the graph down and to the left.</p>

<p>This lesson goes beyond the depth of understanding required to address the standards, so there is not a need to slow down if students struggle with these ideas.</p>
