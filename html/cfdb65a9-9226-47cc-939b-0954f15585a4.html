<p>In this lesson, you will continue to examine and create linear models with linear equations relating two variables. You will also look at several ways to write the equation of a line based on the information given.<br><span><br>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:<br><br></span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Write an equation of the line given the slope and \( y \)-intercept.</li>
  <li>Write an equation of the line given the slope and a point.</li>
  <li>Write an equation of the line given two points.</li>
</ul>
