<p>In this lesson, students work to graph functions in slope-intercept form using transformations. They will identify vertical shifts, vertical stretches and compressions, and vertical rotations.</p>
<p>Through exploration with graphing, students will recognize patterns for the transformations and understand how the constants in the slope-intercept form determine the transformations needed to graph the function.</p>
<p>Students will also be able to describe how one function transforms from the parent function, f(x)=x and how one function transforms to another.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Use slope-intercept form and transformations to graph linear functions. </li>
  <li> Recognize the shifts made to a parent linear function to form another linear function. </li>
</ul>
<h4> Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Use slope-intercept form and transformations to graph linear functions. </li>
  <li> Recognize the shifts made to a parent linear function to form another linear function. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners </h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines. </p>
<ul>
  <li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment </li>
  <li>A3(F) ask and give information ranging from using a very limited bank of high-frequency, high-need, concrete vocabulary, including key words and expressions needed for basic communication in academic and social contexts, to using abstract and content-based vocabulary during extended speaking assignments </li>
  <li>A4(D) use prereading supports such as graphic organizers, illustrations, and pretaught topic-related vocabulary and other prereading activities to enhance comprehension of written text </li>
</ul>
<h4>Support for Building Character</h4>
<p>Throughout this unit, find ways to encourage and support students to work on cultivating their <strong>creativity</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to try during this lesson:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://characterlab.org/tips-of-the-week/compound-interest/" target="_blank" title="Compound Interest">Compound Interest</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="https://characterlab.org/tips-of-the-week/free-your-mind/" target="_blank" title="Free Your Mind">Free Your Mind</a> </li>
