<p>In this lesson, students work to graph functions in slope-intercept form using transformations. They will identify vertical shifts, vertical stretches and compressions, and vertical rotations.</p>
<p>Through exploration with graphing, students will recognize patterns for the transformations and understand how the constants in the slope-intercept form determine the transformations needed to graph the function.</p>
<p>Students will also be able to describe how one function transforms from the parent function, f(x)=x and how one function transforms to another.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Use slope-intercept form and transformations to graph linear functions. </li>
<li> Recognize the shifts made to a parent linear function to form another linear function. </li>
</ul>
<h4> Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
<li> Use slope-intercept form and transformations to graph linear functions. </li>
<li> Recognize the shifts made to a parent linear function to form another linear function. </li>
