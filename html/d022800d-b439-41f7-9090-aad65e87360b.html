<h3>Optional Activity (30 minutes)</h3>
<p>The activities in this lesson are an extension of the TEKS expectations.</p>
<p> It shows three different methods for solving an equation: by rewriting it in factored form, by transforming it into
  an expression in which the squared term has a coefficient 1 and then rewriting in factored form, and by completing the
  square. The second method involves temporarily substituting a part of the expression with another variable so that the
  squared term has a coefficient of 1, which makes it easier to rewrite in factored form. Students encountered this
  strategy in an optional activity ("Finding the Factors of Quadratic Expressions in Standard Form (Optional)") in an
  earlier lesson in Unit 8. If students did not do that optional activity, consider doing it first before using this
  activity.</p>
<p>The numbers in the equations here do not lend themselves to be easily rewritten in factored form (without guessing
  and checking or substitution), or to be easily rewritten into perfect squares (because the leading coefficient and the
  constant terms are not perfect squares), but students see that these equations can be solved with these strategies.
  The activity further illustrates that any of these methods can be rather tedious, providing further motivation to
  solve using the quadratic formula, which students will learn in a future lesson.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Display the perfect squares students saw in the preceding activity. Ask them what they notice about the coefficient
  of the square term in each expression.</p>
<p>\(100x^2+80x+16\)</p>
<p>\(36x^2&minus;60x+25\)</p>
<p>\(25x^2+40x+16\)</p>
<p>\(0.25x^2&minus;14x+196\)</p>
<p>Students are likely to notice that the coefficient of every \(x^2\) is a perfect square, which makes it easier to
  rewrite the completed square as squared factors. Solicit some ideas about whether we could still complete the square
  if a quadratic expression does not have a perfect square for the coefficient of \(x^2\). Then, tell students that they
  will explore a few methods for solving such equations.</p>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Ask one partner to study the first two methods and the other partner to study the
  third method, and then take turns explaining their understanding to each other. Discuss the methods, especially the
  third one, before students begin using them to solve equations.</p>
<p>Make sure students see that, in both the second and third methods, the first step involves multiplying both sides of
  the equation by 3 to make the coefficient of \(x^2\) a perfect square. Each term on the left side of the equation
  changes by a factor of 3, but the right side of the equation remains 0 because multiplying 0 by any number results in
  0.</p>
<p>If time is limited, consider asking students to solve only three equations, using each method once.</p>

    <p>Use this routine to support whole-class discussion. Before addressing the two questions, “What are the advantages of each method? What about its drawbacks?”, give students two to three minutes to plan what they will say when they present their responses to the class. Encourage students to consider what details are important to share and to think about how they will explain their reasoning using mathematical language. If needed, revoice student ideas to demonstrate mathematical language use by restating a statement as a question in order to clarify, apply appropriate language, and involve more students.</p>

    <p>To support development of organizational skills in problem-solving, chunk this task into more manageable parts. For example, cut the three methods apart into separate pieces. Begin by presenting one method at a time and invite students to annotate the examples as they analyze the steps. After students annotate the first method, invite students who have great clarity in their annotations to share their work, and display it for all to see. Encourage students to refer to their annotations as they approach the last problems themselves.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Consider asking students who solve the same equation using different methods to compare and contrast their solution
  strategies. Then, invite them to reflect on the solving process:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> "Did the numbers in certain equations make it easier to solve by one method versus the others?" </li>
  <li> "What are the advantages of each method? What about its drawbacks?" </li>
  <li> "Is there a strategy you prefer or find reliable? Which one and why?" </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell students that in upcoming lessons, they will look at a more efficient method for solving quadratic equations.
