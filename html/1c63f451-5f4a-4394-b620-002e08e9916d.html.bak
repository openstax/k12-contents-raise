<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>The height in feet, \(h\), of a stomp rocket (propelled by a short blast of air) above the ground after \(t\) seconds is given by the equation \(h(t)=5+100t-16t^2\). Here is a graph that represents \(h\).</p>
<p><img alt="A parabola on a coordinate grid. The x-axis represents time in seconds and the y-axis represents the height above the ground in feet. The x-axis scale is 1 and extends from 0 to 7. The y-axis scale is 50 extends from 0 to 200." height="224" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/d0ccc1cc8868a37a9b8d36885521542357c523b6" width="305"/></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>How does the 5 in the equation relate to the graph?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Answer: </strong>The graph intersects the vertical axis at 5.
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li>What does \(100t\) in the equation mean in terms of the rocket?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Answer: </strong>It indicates that the initial velocity of the rocket was 100 feet per second upward.
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
<li>What does the \(-16t^2\) mean in terms of the rocket?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Answer:</strong> This indicates the effect of gravity pulling the rocket back toward Earth.
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
<li> About when does the rocket hit the ground?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Answer:</strong> At about 6.3 seconds.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
