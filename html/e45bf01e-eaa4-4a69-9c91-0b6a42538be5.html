<h4>Solving Systems by Graphing</h4>
<p>The graph of a linear equation is a line. Each point on the line is a solution to the equation. For a system of two equations, we will graph two lines. Then we can see all the points that are solutions to each equation. And, by finding what the lines have in common, we&rsquo;ll find the solution to the system.</p>
<p>Most linear equations in one variable have one solution, but we saw that some equations, called contradictions, have no solutions and for other equations, called identities, all numbers are solutions.</p>

<p>The steps to use to solve a system of linear equations by graphing are shown below.</p>

<div class="os-raise-graybox"><p>How to solve a system of linear equations by graphing.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Find the slope and \(y\)-intercept of the first equation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Find the slope and \(y\)-intercept of the second equation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Graph the two equations on the same rectangular coordinate system.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Identify the solution to the system.</p></div>
<br>
<p>If the lines intersect, identify the point of intersection. Check to make sure it is a solution to both equations. This is the solution to the system.</p>
<p>If the lines are parallel, the system has no solution.</p>
<p>If the lines are the same, the system has an infinite number of solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Solve the system by graphing:&nbsp;</p>
<p>\(y = 2x+1\)</p>
<p>\(y =4x-1\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Find the slope and /(y/)-intercept of the first equation.</p>
<p>In \(y=2x+1\), \(m=2\), \(b=1\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 </strong>- Find the slope and \(y\)-intercept of the second equation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In \(y=4x-1\), \(m=4\), \(b= -1\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 </strong>- Graph the two equations on the same rectangular coordinate system.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4 </strong>- Identify the solution to the system.</p>
<p>The point where the lines intersect is:</p>
