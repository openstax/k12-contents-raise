<p>The focus for this unit is on <strong> judgment </strong>&mdash; the ability to make sound decisions without bias.</p>
<ul>
  <li> In the Unit 6 Overview and Readiness lesson, students will see an example of how this trait is modeled through a real-world scenario. </li>
  <li> In each lesson&rsquo;s Teacher Guide, you will be provided with links to tips that may help you foster this trait in students. </li>

<h4>Why Does Judgment Matter?</h4>
<p>Jugement is the ability to get as close as possible to the best answer without bias. The ability to separate personal beliefs from facts is a skill that needs to be developed. Being aware of personal bias and the ability to overcome bias makes for good judgment.</p>
<h4>How Do I Encourage Judgment in My Students?</h4>
<p>Consider some of these suggestions for promoting judgment in your classroom:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Model it. </strong>Talk about when you need to exercise judgment and when you don&rsquo;t: &ldquo;This is a problem where we should apply a predefined policy or set of guidelines, not a case-by-case judgment.&rdquo; Where judgment is required, emphasize that disagreements are likely. Focus attention on the process: &ldquo;What principles should we use to make this decision?&rdquo;</li>
  <li><strong>Celebrate it.</strong> Praise people who are aware of the limits of their own judgment: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great that you are trying hard to get the right answer, not just sticking to your prior beliefs.&rdquo;</li>
  <li><strong>Enable it.</strong> Help break decisions into bite-size chunks: &ldquo;What are the smaller, easier considerations on which this judgment depends, and how can you make them separately?&rdquo; Use comparisons: Relative judgments are more reliable than absolute ones. Ask questions that take an &ldquo;outside view&rdquo;: &ldquo;What would the typical answer be for comparable problems?&rdquo; Leverage the diversity of perspectives: &ldquo;Can we obtain independent opinions and use their average?&rdquo;</li>
