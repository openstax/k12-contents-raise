<h3>Optional Activity (10 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity is optional. Use it to allow students to practice writing quadratic expressions to produce several graphs with particular features. Here students will need to know how to restrict the domain of the graph produced using the technology available to them. If students are not already familiar with how to do so, demonstrate how to do so with a simple quadratic function, for example: \(y=x^2\), where the domain is \(-2 \leq x \leq 2\).</p>
<p>The activity is unlike the ones students have seen before and requires students to transfer and apply their understanding in new ways. It is a chance for students to make sense of a problem and persevere in solving it .</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Provide access to devices that can run Desmos or other graphing technology.</p>

<p>Do you see two "eyes" and a smiling "mouth" on the graph? The three arcs on the graph all represent quadratic functions that were initially defined by \(y=x^2\), but whose equations were later modified.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Write an equation to represent the smile in the smiley face.</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>The mouth can be given by \(y=x^2+10\) because it is the graph of \(y=x^2\)&nbsp; shifted 10 units upward.&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
  <li>Write an equation to represent the left eye in the smiley face.</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The left eye can be given by \(y=-(x+2)^2+50\) because the vertex is located at \((-2,50)\) and it opens downward.</p>
<ol start="3">
  <li>Write an equation to represent the right eye in the smiley face.</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<strong> </strong>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The right eye can be given by \(y=-(x&minus;2)^2+50\) because the vertex is located at \((2,50)\) and it opens downward.</p>
<ol start="4">
  <li>What is the domain for the mouth?</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> For the mouth, the domain is \(-4 \leq x \leq 4\).</p>
<ol start="5">
  <li>What is the domain for the left eye?</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>For the left eye, the domain is \(-3 \leq x \leq -1\) .</p>
<ol start="6">
  <li>What is the domain for the right eye?</li>
</ol>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> For the right eye, the domain is \(1 \leq x \leq 3\) .</p>
