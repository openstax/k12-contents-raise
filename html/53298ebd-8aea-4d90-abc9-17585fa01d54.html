<p>In this lesson, you will practice identifying parts of quadratic functions from different forms. You will also work to rewrite quadratic functions from one form to another.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Identify the vertex of a quadratic function from an equation. </li>
  <li> Write quadratics in vertex, factored, and standard forms. </li>
  <li> Write quadratic functions in vertex form given a vertex and another point. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 9.9.1: Finding the Vertex in Vertex Form </li>
  <li> 9.9.2: Different Forms of Quadratics </li>
  <ul>
    <li> 9.9.2: Self Check </li>
    <li> 9.9.2: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 9.9.3: Vertex Form Given a Vertex and Point </li>
  <ul>
    <li> 9.9.3: Self Check </li>
    <li> 9.9.3: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 9.9.4: Rewriting Quadratics </li>
</ul>
<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>
