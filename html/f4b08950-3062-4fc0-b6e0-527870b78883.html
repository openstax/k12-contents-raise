<h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>
<p>In this lesson, students continue to examine methods of writing an equation of a line. While exploring the new topic, students will review finding slope and writing lines in point-slope and slope-intercept form. They also use their understanding of the \(y\)-intercept form of the equation of a line. In recent lessons, students learned that the method they use to write the equation of a line is determined by the information given. They will continue to use those methods along with the relationship between slopes of lines to identify and write equations of parallel and perpendicular lines. Students must understand the concept of reciprocals and opposite reciprocals to understand perpendicular lines. Having students compare graphs can help them visualize the concepts.</p>
<p>Students will find the equations of lines parallel and perpendicular to horizontal and vertical lines. They will use the understanding that the slope of a horizontal line is zero and the slope of a vertical line is undefined.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h3>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use the relationship between slopes of lines to write equations of lines that are parallel or perpendicular.</li>
  <li>Use the point-slope form to write linear equations of parallel and perpendicular lines.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Write an equation of a line parallel to a given line.</li>
  <li>Write an equation of a line perpendicular to a given line.</li>
  <li>Write an equation of a line parallel or perpendicular to an axis.</li>
</ul>

<!--SUPPORT OF ENGLISH LEARNERS Tables -->

<h4>Support for English Language Learners </h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A1(F) use accessible language and learn new and essential language in the process</li>
  <li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audio tape, video, DVD, and CD ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment </li>
  <li>A2(I) dem listening comprehension of increasingly complex spoken Eng by following directions, retelling or summarizing spoken messages, responding to questions and requests, collaborating with peers, and taking notes commensurate with content and grade-level needs</li>
  <li>A3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions </li>
  <li>A3(I) adapt spoken language appropriately for formal and informal purposes</li>
</ul>
