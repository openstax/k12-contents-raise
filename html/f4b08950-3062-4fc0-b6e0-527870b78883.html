      <h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>In this lesson, students continue to examine methods of writing an equation of a line. While exploring the new topic, students will review finding slope and writing lines in point-slope and slope-intercept form. They also use their understanding of the \(y\)-intercept form of the equation of a line. In recent lessons, students learned that the method they use to write the equation of a line is determined by the information given. They will continue to use those methods along with the relationship between slopes of lines to identify and write equations of parallel and perpendicular lines. Students must understand the concept of reciprocals and opposite reciprocals to understand perpendicular lines. Having students compare graphs can help them visualize the concepts.</p>
        <p>Students will find the equations of lines parallel and perpendicular to horizontal and vertical lines. They will use the understanding that the slope of a horizontal line is zero and the slope of a vertical line is undefined.&nbsp;</p>
