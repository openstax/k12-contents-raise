      <h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>So far in the unit, students have primarily used descriptions, expressions, and equations to represent relationships and constraints. In this lesson, they revisit the idea that graphs can be a useful way to represent relationships. Students are reminded that each point on a graph is a solution to an equation the graph represents. They analyze points on and off a graph and interpret them in context. In explaining correspondences between equations, verbal descriptions, and graphs, students hone their skill at making sense of problems.</p>
        <p>In this lesson, students are also introduced to the use of graphing technology to graph equations. This introduction could happen independently as long as it precedes the second activity in the lesson.</p>

      <h3>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h3>
      <p>Students will be able to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span>Comprehend that the graph of a linear equation in two variables represents all pairs of values that are solutions to the equation.</span><br></li>
        <li>Interpret points on a graph of a linear equation to answer questions about the quantities in context.</li>
        <li>Use graphing technology to graph linear equations and identify solutions to the equations.</li>
      </ul>
