<h3>Lesson Narrative</h3>
<p>So far in the unit, students have primarily used descriptions, expressions, and equations to represent relationships
  and constraints. In this lesson, they revisit the idea that graphs can be a useful way to represent relationships.
  Students are reminded that each point on a graph is a solution to an equation the graph represents. They analyze
  points on and off a graph and interpret them in context. In explaining correspondences between equations, verbal
  descriptions, and graphs, students hone their skill at making sense of problems.</p>
<p>In this lesson, students are also introduced to the use of graphing technology to graph equations. This introduction
  could happen independently as long as it precedes the second activity in the lesson.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span>Comprehend that the graph of a linear equation in two variables represents all pairs of values that are
      solutions to the equation.</span><br></li>
  <li>Interpret points on a graph of a linear equation to answer questions about the quantities in context.</li>
  <li>Use graphing technology to graph linear equations and identify solutions to the equations.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Use graphing technology to graph linear equations and identify solutions to the equations.</li>
  <li>Explain how the coordinates of the points on the graph of a linear equation are related to the equation.</li>
  <li>Explain the meaning of points on a graph in terms of the situation it represents when given the graph of a linear
    equation.</li>
</ul>

    <h4>Support for English Language Learners
    </h4>
    <p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment
      </li>
      <li>A3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions
      </li>
      <li>A4(G) demonstrate comprehension of increasingly complex English by participating in shared reading, retelling, or summarizing material, responding to questions, and taking notes commensurate with content area and grade level needs
      </li>
    </ul>
