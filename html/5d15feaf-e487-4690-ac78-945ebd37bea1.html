<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<div>

</div>
<div>
  <p>In this lesson, students will be writing linear inequalities that represent constraints in situations and graphing the solution regions. To prepare for that work, students review writing and graphing an equation that represents a situation.</p>
</div>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<div>
  <p>If needed, explain or show additional images of grass sod and flower beds to students who might be unfamiliar with these landscaping terms.</p>
</div>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>A homeowner is making plans to landscape her yard. She plans to hire professionals to install grass sod in some parts of the yard and flower beds in other parts.</p>
        <p>Grass sod installation costs&nbsp;<span>$</span>2 per square foot and flower bed installation costs&nbsp;<span>$</span>12 per square foot. Her budget for the project is&nbsp;<span>$</span>3,000.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div><span><br>1. Write an equation that represents the square feet of grass sod,&nbsp;\( x \), and the square feet of flower beds,&nbsp;\( y \), that she could afford if she used her entire budget.</span>
</div>
<div><span><br></span></div>
<div><span>2. On the coordinate plane, or using a graphing calculator, sketch a graph that represents your equation. Be prepared to explain your reasoning.<br></span><br><img alt="Blank grid, origin O. Horizontal axis, grass sod, square feet, scale is 0 to 1,800 by 200&rsquo;s. Vertical axis, flower beds, square feet, scale is 0 to 300 by 50&rsquo;s." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="381" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/a51dea57bd4cceb8561a1ff8c844290b0605aac4" width="600"></div>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<div><span>1. \( 2x + 12y = 3,\!000 \)&nbsp;(or equivalent)</span><br><span>2. Sample response:</span>
  <div><img alt="Graph of a line. Flower beds, square feet. Grass sod, square feet." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="225" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/9fbd4a77e2050c9eff76f721b35f44eb149a5364" width="300"><br><br></div>
</div>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<div>
  <p>Invite students to share their equation and graph. Discuss with students:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>"In this situation, what does a point on the line mean?" (A combination of square feet of grass sod and square feet of flower beds that the homeowner could have if she spent her entire budget.)</li>
    <li>"What does the vertical intercept of the graph mean?" (The square feet of flower beds she could have if she installs no grass sod.)</li>
    <li>"What does the horizontal intercept of the graph tell us?" (The square feet of grass sod she could install if she installs no flower beds.)</li>
  </ul>
