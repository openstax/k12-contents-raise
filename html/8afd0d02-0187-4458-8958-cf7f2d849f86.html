  <li>In the scatter plot below, the length of fish and the age of the fish are shown. The residual for the fish that is
    2 years old and 100 mm long is 8.06 mm.</li>

  <p>What does this residual mean?</p>
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The actual fish at 2 years old is about 8 mm longer than the linear model estimates.

<p>A line of best fit has an equation of \(y= 1.5115x + 7.526\), where \(x\) represents the 100-meter time and \(y\)
  represents the 200-meter time.</p>
