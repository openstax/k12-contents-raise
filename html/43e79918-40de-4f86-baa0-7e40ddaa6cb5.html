<h4>Activity: Converting Between Factored Form and Standard Form (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students will reinforce skills developed in the unit by converting between the factored form and standard form of quadratic expressions.</p>
<p>Remind students that they can use FOIL to convert from factored form to standard form. In order to convert from standard form to factored form, students must rely on the factoring skills developed during the unit.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students into groups of two. Read the instruction in the activity as a class. Provide the "Student A" table of expressions to one student in a pair and the "Student B" table of expressions to the other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As students convert their expressions and compare their answers with their partners, observe for any pairs that might need guidance.</p>

<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<p>You have learned strategies for writing a quadratic expression in its factored form and standard form. In each round of this activity, you and your partner will be given equivalent quadratic expressions in different forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal of each round is to write the quadratic expression as it has been given to your partner. If your expression is in factored form, write it in standard form. If your expression is in standard form, write it in factored form. At the end of each round, compare the expressions with your partner without revealing the expressions for future rounds.</p>
<p>If, in any round, you need help, you may ask your partner to explain the next step without revealing the solution.</p>
<p>Proceed from rounds 1 to 6 while discussing your thinking if there is any disagreement.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Ask students:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li> "How did you convert from factored form to standard form?" (I used FOIL to multiply each term in each binomial by each other term. Then I simplified like terms to find the standard form of the expression.) </li>
<li> "How did you convert from standard form to factored form?" </li>
<ul>
<li> Possible answers include: </li>
<ul>
<li> I used trial and error to find the coefficients of the binomials in factored form. </li>
<li> I recognized the difference of squares in one of the expressions in standard form. </li>
<li> I worked backward from FOIL to reason the coefficients of each binomial in factored form. </li>
<li> I found all the factors of the constant term of the expression in the standard form. I found all of the factors of the leading quadratic coefficient of the expression in the standard form. I found the combination of these factors that correctly added to equal the coefficient of the linear term of the expression in standard form. </li>
</ul>
