<p>In this lesson, you will evaluate expressions at certain \(x\)-values to see if they produce an output of \(0\). You will learn what the factored form can tell us about the vertex and the \(y\)-intercept of a graph representing a quadratic function.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Graph a quadratic function given in factored form. </li>
  <li> Find the vertex and \(y\)-intercept of the graph of a quadratic function in factored form without graphing it first. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
