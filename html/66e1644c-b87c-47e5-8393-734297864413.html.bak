<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>Students will use knowledge of point-slope form to find the equation of lines given a point and a slope. They will then write each equation in slope-intercept form and explore equations with the same slopes and different \(y\)-intercepts. Being exposed to examples and non-examples will help lead them to the concept of perpendicular lines that have slopes that are opposite reciprocals of each other.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Allow students to work in pairs to go through each step of the activity. Each student should receive a paper of coordinate grids. Colored pencils and a straight-edge are recommended. When graphing, it is suggested that students graph each line in a different color and label the line with the equation. At the end of the activity, have pairs share their results of each step to the class and what they noticed along the way.</p>

<br/>
        The slope of the perpendicular line is the opposite reciprocal of the slope of the original line, \( -2 \). The point on the line is \( (6, 4) \). The first coordinate, 6, is the \( x \)-coordinate. The second coordinate, 4, is the \( y \)-coordinate.<br/>

<br/>

        The slope of the perpendicular line is the opposite reciprocal of the slope of the original line. Remember to change the sign. The original line has slope \( \frac{1}{2} \). The opposite reciprocal is \( -2 \).<br/>

<h4>Finding a Perpendicular Line Given an Equation and Point</h4>
<p>In this section, you will use what you know about writing the equation of a line given the slope and a point to write the equation of perpendicular lines. The graph shows the equation of the line \( y = 2x - 3 \). The point \( P(-2, 1) \) is also plotted. You can use the fact that perpendicular lines have slopes that are opposite reciprocals to find a line that is perpendicular to line \(l\) and goes through point \( P(-2, 1) \).</p>
<p><img alt="A graph with a blue line with negative slope. A light blue dot is at the point (-2, 1). The x- and y-axes range from -6 to 6." class="atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="450" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/51e2911a4ca1a2e6fa4aaaf1120031d5db87a061" width="400"/> </p>
<p>From the equation, you know the slope of the line is 2. The second line will pass through \( P(-2, 1) \) and have slope \( - \frac{1}{2} \). To graph the line, start at \( (-2, 1) \) and count out the rise and run. The slope is \( \frac{rise}{run}=\frac{-1}{2} \). Count out the rise, \( -1 \), and run, 2, and plot the point. You can graph the line as shown. Line \( n \) is perpendicular to line \( l \) and goes through point \( (-2, 1) \). </p>

<p>To find the equation of a line perpendicular to a line through a given point algebraically, you can use what you know about finding the equation of a line given the slope and a point.</p>

<p><b>Step 1 - </b> Find the slope of the given line.<br/>

<p><b>Step 3 - </b>Identify the point<br/>
  The given point is \( (-2, 1) \)<br/>
  \( (x_1, y_1) = (-2, 1) \) </p>
<p><b>Step 4 - </b>Substitute values into the point-slope form \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \)<br/>
  Simplify<br/>
  \( \begin{array}{rcl}y - y_1 &amp;=&amp; m(x - x_1) \\ y-1 &amp;=&amp; -\frac{1}{2}(x - (-2)) \\ y-1 &amp;=&amp; -\frac{1}{2}(x + 2) \\ y-1 &amp;=&amp; -\frac{1}{2}x - 1\end{array} \)</p>
<p><b>Step 5 - </b>Write the equation in slope-intercept form<br/>
