<p>In this lesson, you will encounter quadratic expressions without a linear term and consider how to write them in factored form. We will begin by studying numerical examples and noticing that certain expressions are equivalent.</p>
<p>Remember that when you want to enter a number with an exponent, use the ^ symbol. It will look like "\(x^2\)" when you want to enter \(x^2\). To make the ^ symbol, push shift and the numeral 6 at the same time.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> Explain why multiplying binomials that are a sum and a difference, \((x + m)(x &minus; m)\), results in a quadratic expression with no linear term. </li>
<li> Rewrite a quadratic expression of the form \(x^2&minus;c\) into its factored form. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
