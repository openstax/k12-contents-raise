<p>Pattern A</p>

<p>Pattern B</p>
<p><img alt="A pattern of dots. Step 0 has a row of 2 dots. Step 1 has 2 rows of dots. The top row has one dot. In the last row, there are 2 dots. The left dot in the last row is in a column to the left of the column containing the dot from the prior row. The right dot is in a column to the right of the column containing the dot from the prior row. Step 2 has 3 rows of dots. In the top two rows, there are 2 dots in each row stacked on top of each other. In the last row, there are 2 dots. The left dot in this last row is in a column to the left of the left most column containing the dots from the prior rows. The right dot is in a column to the right of the right most column containing the dots from the prior rows. Step 3 has 4 rows of dots. In the top three rows, there are 3 dots in each row stacked on top of each other. In the last row, there are 2 dots. The left dot in this last row is in a column to the left of the left most column containing the dots from the prior rows.

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3" type="a">
<li> Which pattern shows a quadratic relationship between the step number and the number of dots?
      <ul>
<li> Pattern A </li>
<li> Pattern B </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Pattern B</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li>Each expression represents the total number of dots in a pattern where \(n\) represents the step number.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Select two</strong> expressions that represent a quadratic relationship between the step number and the total number of dots. (If you get stuck, consider sketching the first few steps of each pattern as described by the expression.)</p>
<ul>
<li> \(n^2\) </li>
<li> \(2n\) </li>
<li> \(n \cdot n\) </li>
<li> \(n+n\) </li>
<li> \(n+2\) </li>
<li> \(n \div 2\) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(n^2\) and \(n \cdot n\)</p>
