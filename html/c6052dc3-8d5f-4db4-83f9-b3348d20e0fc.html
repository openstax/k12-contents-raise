<h3> Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here are two graphs representing the function \(f\)&nbsp;given by \(f(x)=10 \cdot 2^x\) and the function \(g\) defined by \(g(x)=a \cdot b^x\).</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Is \(b\) greater than or less than 2? Explain how you know. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer: </strong>\(b\)&nbsp;is greater than 2. Sample responses:
    <ul>
      <li> The graph of \(g\) starts off being below the graph of&nbsp;\(f\), but later it surpasses the graph of&nbsp;\(f\). Since&nbsp;\(g\)&nbsp;grows more quickly than&nbsp;\(f\),&nbsp;the growth factor \(b\) for&nbsp;\(g\)&nbsp;must be greater than the growth factor for&nbsp;\(f\),&nbsp;which is 2. </li>
      <li> The growth factor from the first point \((0,3)\) to the second point \((1,12)\) is 4 because \(\frac{12}{3}=4\), and 4 is greater than 2.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Write an equation that defines \(g\). Explain your answer. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(g(x)=3 \cdot 4^x\) because the initial value is 3 and the \(y\)-value is multiplied by 4 when the \(x\)-value increases by 1, so the growth factor is 4. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>\(f\) and \(g\) represent the number, in thousands, of social media followers of two organizations as a function of years since 2010. What does the intersection of \(f\) and&nbsp;\(g\)&nbsp;mean in this context?&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> It represents the time, in years since 2010, when the two organizations have the same number of followers.

<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5> More Chances</h5>
<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>
