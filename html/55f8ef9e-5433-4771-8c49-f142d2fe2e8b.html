<h4>Domain and Range of Exponential Graphs</h4>
<p>The graph below describes the amount of caffeine, \(c\), in a person&rsquo;s body \(t\) hours after an initial
measurement of 100 mg. The equation of this line is  \(y=100(1-0.1)^t\).</p>

<p>What is the smallest value \(c\) can reach?</p>
<p>Since \(c\) is the amount of caffeine, it can get close to 0.</p>
<p>Can \(t\)&nbsp;ever take on negative values?</p>
<p>No, time will not be negative in this relationship because time is moving forward.</p>
<p>What are the lowest and highest values for \(t\)?</p>
<p>At the beginning, \(t=0\), and \(t\)&nbsp;can go as long as it takes for \(c\)&nbsp;to get so close to 0 it is insignificant.</p>
<p>The domain (or values of \(t\)) written as an inequality is \(t \geq 0\).</p>
<p>The range (or values of \(c\)) written as an inequality is \(0&lt;c \leq 100\).</p>

  <p>Here is how to determine the domain and range of an exponential function:</p>
  <p>To determine the domain, look at the \(t\) values. The car is bought when \(t=0\), so the domain is \(t \geq 0\).</p>
  <p>To determine the range, look at the \(f\)&nbsp;values, or the possible dollar values of the car. The car is bought at $12,000 and will lose value until the value is close to $0, but it will never be worth negative dollars.</p>
  <p>The range is \(0&lt;f \leq 12000\).</p>
