<h3>Activity (10 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity introduces the concept of relations as an ordered pair and leads students into determining if a relation is a function. Students should be able to determine if a relation is a function from a mapping or set of ordered pairs.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students into pairs so they can discuss if each relation is a function. As a class, discuss the inputs and outputs of each relation and if each is a function.</p>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<p>A relation is any set of ordered pairs, \((x,y)\).</p>
<p>A function is a special type of relation that maps every input, \(x\), to exactly one output, \(y\).</p>
<p>Tell if each relation is a function and explain.<br></p>

<h4>Student Response</h4>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Yes, this is a function because every input goes to exactly one output.</li>
<li>This relation is not a function. Raul and Jenny have 2 emails, so twice there are inputs that go to two outputs.</li>
<li>This is not a function because each input goes to multiple outputs.</li>
<li>Each input, \(x\)-value, is matched with only one output, \(y\)-value. So this relation is a function.</li>
<li>The input (\(x\)-value), 9, is matched with two outputs (\(y\)-values), both 3 and &minus;3. So this relation is not a function.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Lead the class into a discussion that a function is always a relation, but a relation is not always a function.</p>
<p>Give the students the following table and ask how they can determine if the relation is a function. Encourage students to write each point in the table as a coordinate pair and also as a mapping. Discuss which representation they prefer.</p>

<h3>4.1.3: Additional Resources</h3>
<p><strong><em>The following content is available to students who would like more support based on their experience with the self check. Students will not automatically have access to this content, so you may wish to share it with those who could benefit from it.</em></strong></p>
<h4>Is the Relation a Function?</h4>
<p><strong>Determining Whether a Relation Represents a Function</strong></p>
<p>A relation is a set of ordered pairs. The set of the first components of each ordered pair are the inputs, and the set of the second components of each ordered pair are the outputs. Consider the following set of ordered pairs. The first numbers in each pair are the first five natural numbers. The second number in each pair has twice the value of the first.</p>
<p>{\((1,2),(2,4),(3,6),(4,8),(5,10)\)}</p>
<p>The set of inputs is {\(1,2,3,4,5\)}. The set of outputs is {\(2,4,6,8,10\)}.</p>
<p>Note that each value in the domain is also known as an<strong> input </strong>value, or <strong>independent</strong> <strong>variable</strong>, and is often labeled with the lowercase letter \(x\). Each value in the range is also known as an <strong>output </strong>value, or <strong>dependent variable</strong>, and is often labeled lowercase letter \(y\).</p>
<p>A function \(f\) is a relation that assigns a single output to each input. In other words, no \(x\)-values are repeated. For our example that relates the first five natural numbers to numbers double their values, this relation is a function because each input, {\(1,2,3,4,5\)}, is paired with exactly one output, {\(2,4,6,8,10\)}.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s consider the set of ordered pairs that relates the terms &ldquo;even&rdquo; and &ldquo;odd&rdquo; to the first five natural numbers. It would appear as</p>
<p>{ (odd,1),(even,2),(odd,3),(even,4),(odd,5) }</p>
<p>Notice that each input, {even,odd}, is not paired with exactly one output, {\(1,2,3,4,5\)}. For example, the term &ldquo;odd&rdquo; corresponds to three output values, {\(1,3,5\)}, and the term &ldquo;even&rdquo; corresponds to two output values, {\(2,4\)}. This violates the definition of a function, so this relation is not a function.</p>
<p>A mapping is sometimes used to show a relation. The arrows show the pairing of the inputs with the outputs.</p>
<p>Here are some relations that are functions and not functions.</p>

<br>
<ol type="a">
<li>This relationship is a function because each input is associated with a single output. Note that inputs \(q\) and \(r\) both give output \(n\).</li>
<li>This relationship is also a function. In this case, each input is associated with a single output.</li>
<li>This relationship is not a function because input \(q\) is associated with two different outputs.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Given a relationship between two quantities, determine whether the relationship is a function.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the input values.</li>
<li>Identify the output values.</li>
<li>If each input value leads to only one output value, classify the relationship as a function. If any input value leads to two or more outputs, do not classify the relationship as a function.</li>
</ol>

<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to check your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to determine if the relation is a function:</p>
<p>Since every input (name) goes to only one output (birthday), this relation is a function.</p>
