<p>Some key takeaways from this lesson are that equations can be written in different forms. Often, one form is better than another based on the information given.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Ask students to create their own problems and write the equation three different ways. </li>
  <li> Show that an equation in all three forms is equivalent by substituting a point into all three equations. </li>
  <li> Continue to have students use formal mathematical vocabulary around slope and the different forms. </li>
</ul>
<p>In the next lesson, students will see how slope as rate of change occurs in real-world situations.</p>
