<p>Some key takeaways from this lesson are that equations can be written in different forms. Often, one form is better than another based on the information given.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Ask students to create their own problems and write the equation three different ways. </li>
  <li> Show that an equation in all three forms is equivalent by substituting a point into all three equations. </li>
  <li> Continue to have students use formal mathematical vocabulary around slope and the different forms. </li>
</ul>
<p>In the next lesson, students will see how slope as rate of change occurs in real-world situations.</p>
<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
