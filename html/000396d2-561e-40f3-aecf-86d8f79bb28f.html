<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>In this activity, students continue to compare two functions by studying graphs and statements in function notation,
  as well as interpreting them in terms of a situation. They also revisit the meaning of a solution to an equation such
  as \(C(t)=20\), both abstractly and in context, and apply what they know about average rate of change to compare the
  trend shown by each graph.</p>
<p>Additionally, the activity draws students’ attention to the point where the two graphs intersect, its meaning
  in context, and its corresponding representation in function notation.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Ask students how many of them have a landline phone at home and how many only have cell phones. If students are
  unfamiliar with landline phones, explain as needed.</p>
<p>Display the graphs for all to see. Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>“How would you describe the trends in phone ownership over the years?” (Cell phones are increasing in
    use, and landlines are decreasing.)</li>
<li>“How would you describe the shape of the graph of each function?” (Both are roughly linear. The value
    of \(H\) is decreasing over time, so the graph slants downward. The value of \(C\) is increasing over time, so the
    graph slants upward.)</li>
<li>“In what year did about 60% of homes have a landline?” (2012)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Student Activity </h4>
<p>\(H(t)\) is the percentage of homes in the United States that have a landline phone in year \(t\). \(C(t)\) is the
  percentage of homes with only a cell phone. Here are the graphs of \(H\) and \(C\).</p>
<p><img alt="Line graph showing percentage of homes with landline phones decreasing from 2004 to 2016, while cell phone only homes increase over the same period.

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>Estimate \(H(2006)\)? Explain what this value tells us about the phones.</li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(H(2006)\) is about 85. This means in 2006, 85% of homes had a landline phone.</p>
<li>Explain what the value of \(H(2006)\) tells us about the phones.</li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> In 2006, 85% of homes had a landline phone.</p>
<li>Estimate \(C(2006)\).</li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(C(2006)\) is about 14. This means in 2006, 14% of homes had only a cell phone and no landline.</p>
<li>Explain what the value of \(C(2006)\) tells us about the phones.</li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> In 2006, 14% of homes had only a cell phone and no landline.</p>
<li>What is the approximate solution to \(C(t)=20\)? Explain what the solution means in this situation.</li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Approximately 2008. It means that around 2008, 20% of homes used only cell phones.</p>
<li>Explain what the solution to \(C(t)=20\) means in this situation.</li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The solution to \(C(t)=20\) is \(t = 2008\). This means that around 2008, 20% of homes used only cell phones.</p>
<li>Is this equation true: \(C(2011)=H(2011)\)? Explain your reasoning.</li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> No. \(C(2011) \neq H(2011)\). The percentage of homes with a landline in 2011, \(H(2011)\), is about 70. The percentage of homes with only a cell phone in 2011, \(C(2011)\), is about 30. These values are not equal.</p>
<li>Explain how you know if the equation \(C(2011)=H(2011)\) is true or not.</li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The equation is not true. In 2011, \(H(2011)\) is about 70%, indicating that 70% of homes had a landline. \(C(2011)\) is about 30%, indicating that 30% of homes had only a cell phone. Since these values are not equal, the equation is false.</p>
<li>Is this equation true: \(C(2015)=H(2015)\)? Explain how you know.</li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. \(C(2015) = H(2015)\). In 2015, the percentages of homes with a landline and those with only a cell phone were equal, as shown by the intersection of the graphs.</p>
<li>Explain how you know if the equation \(C(2015)=H(2015)\) is true or not.</li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The equation is true. In 2015, the graph showing the percentage of homes with a landline intersects with the graph showing the percentage of homes with only a cell phone, indicating that both percentages were equal.</p>
<li>Between 2004 and 2015, did the percentage of homes with landlines decrease at the same rate at which the percentage of cell-phones-only homes increased? Explain your reasoning.</li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, the rate of increase for cell-phones-only homes and the rate of decrease for landline-owning homes were close but not exactly the same. In 2004, about 6% of homes had only cell phones, while in 2015, about 48% did. For landlines, the percentages were 92% in 2004 and 48% in 2015.</p>
<li>Explain the reasoning for your response to the previous question about the change in percentages of homes with landlines and cell-phones-only from 2004 to 2015.</li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The reasoning is based on the average rate of change for each type of phone usage. The percentage of homes with only cell phones grew from 6% in 2004 to 48% in 2015, while the percentage of homes with landlines decreased from 92% to 48% during the same period. The rates of increase and decrease are not identical but show a general trend of decreasing landline use and increasing cell phone-only use.</p>

<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>Explain why the statement \(C(t)+H(t)\leq100\) is true in this situation.</li>
<li>What value does \(C(t)+H(t)\) appear to take between 2004 and 2017? How much does this value vary in that
      interval?</li>
</ol>
<h4>Extension Student Response</h4>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>Each household either has a landline or has no landline and relies only on cell phones, so \(H(t)\) and \(C(t)\)
      calculate separate groups of people. As long as there are not rounding errors, \(H(t)\) and \(C(t)\) together can
      only be 100 percent, and it is less if there are people with no phone service at all.</li>
<li>It appears to take a value a little less than 100, maybe close to 97. For example, the two graphs meet below the
      midway point (50). At the beginning and the end of the shown interval, they add up to a little less than 100 as
      well. The sum is not constant (the shapes of the two graphs are different) but does not vary much, so the
      percentage of people with no phone service is small for the entire period.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students encounter percentages as the output of a function for the first time in this activity. Some students might
    think that the output of the functions here must be number of homes, and that they cannot estimate any output values
    because only percentages are known. Clarify that percent is the unit used in this case because we are studying how
    the proportion of the two groups (rather than the actual number of homes in each group) changed over time.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Focus the discussion on the meaning of equations, such as \(C(t)=20\) and \(C(2015)=H(2015)\), and on the meaning
    of the average rate of change of each function.</p>
<p>Select students to share their responses. Highlight the following points, if not already mentioned in
    students’ explanations:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(C(t)=20\) means “in year \(t\), 20% of homes relied only on cell phones” and, based on the graph
      of \(C\), the value of \(t\) that makes that statement true is 2008.</li>
<li>\(C(2015)=H(2015)\) means “in year 2015, the percentage of homes with only cell phones and the percentage
      of homes with landlines are equal.” We know this is true because at \(t=2015\) the two graphs intersect,
      which also means they share the same output value.</li>
<li>The average rate of change for \(C\) is positive because, in the measured interval, the value of \(C\) increased
      overall. The average rate of change for \(H\) is negative because the value of \(H\) decreased overall.</li>
<li>An average rate of change of 3.8% per year for \(C\) means that the percentage of homes relying only on cell
      phones grew by about 3.8% each year.</li>
<li>An average rate of change of –4% per year means the percentage of homes that used landlines fell by 4%
      each year.</li>
</ul>
<p>If time permits, discuss with students:</p>
<ul>
<li>“The average rate of change for \(C\) is 4% per year, while the average rate of change for \(H\) is
      –3.8% per year, which is very close to –4%. Why might the rate at which one increased be so close to
      the rate at which the other decreased? Could it be a coincidence?” (One possible explanation is that, as
      people relied more on cell phones, they relied less on landlines, and they discontinued using landlines around the
      same time they acquired new cell phones. These people essentially went from one group to the other.)</li>
</ul>
