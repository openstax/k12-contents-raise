<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students explore another model of a projectile motion. They graph and interpret a quadratic function in context and begin considering a reasonable domain for the function. Along the way, they practice reasoning concretely and abstractly. By the end of the lesson, they relate the vertex of the graph to the maximum height of the cannonball and the positive zero of the function to the time when the cannonball hits the ground.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Provide access to devices that can run Desmos or other graphing technology. If needed, demonstrate how to adjust the graphing boundaries of the graphing tool.</p>
<p>Depending on the graphing tool available and their facility with it, students may approach the estimations in the third question in different ways (including by eyeballing). If desired, demonstrate how to use the graphing tool to trace the graph and identify the coordinates of any point on it (which may include values that are precise or values rounded to a specified decimal place). Or, first observe how students go about estimating and give additional guidance as needed.</p>
<p>To support students with the last question, ask students: &ldquo;Is the equation a good model for predicting the height of the cannonball 10 seconds after it is fired? What about 1 minute after it is fired?&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<ol>
<li>The function defined by \(d=50+312t-16t^2\) gives the height in feet of a cannonball \(t\) seconds after the ball leaves the cannon.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<ol type="a">
<li> What does the term 50 tell us about the cannonball? <br>
<br>
<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The 50 tells us the cannonball is fired from 50 feet off of the ground.
        </li>
</ol>
</ol>
<ol>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li> What does the term \(312t\) tell us about the cannonball?<br>
<br>
<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The \(312t\) tells us that the initial upward velocity is 312 feet per second.
        </li>
</ol>
</ol>
<ol>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li> What does \(-16t^2\) tell us about the cannonball? <br>
<br>
<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong> The \(-16t^2\) represents the effect of gravity pulling the cannonball back to the ground.
        </li>

<li>Use the graphing tool or technology outside the course. Graph the function. Adjust the graphing window to the following boundaries: \(0&lt;x&lt;25\) and \(0&lt;y&lt;2000\).</li>

<ol start="3">
<li>Observe the graph and:</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<ol type="a">
<li> Describe the shape of the graph. What does it tell us about the movement of the cannonball? <br>
<br>
<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The distance from the ground increases, reaches a peak, and then decreases, which makes sense in the situation. It also looks like the distance from the ground decreases in the same way that it increased on the way up. The graph tells us the cannonball went up in the air, and then fell back down to the ground.
        </li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>The shape of the quadratic function is called a parabola. It has a &ldquo;U&rdquo; shape.</p>
<ol>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li> Estimate the maximum height the ball reaches. When does this happen? <br>
<br>
<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The cannonball gets up to a little over 1500 feet, maybe to 1600 feet, at around 10 seconds.
        </li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>The peak of the parabola, where the maximum occurs, is also called the vertex of the graph.</p>
<ol>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li> Estimate when the ball hits the ground. <br>
<br>
<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The cannonball hits the ground a little bit before 20 seconds.
        </li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>The zero of a function is where the function equals 0, or where it crosses the \(x\)-axis. In this case, there is only one zero where the cannonball hits the ground. The parabola does cross the \(x\)-axis in the negative \(x\)-values, but that does not make sense in this problem.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>What domain is appropriate for this function? Explain your reasoning.<br>
<br>
<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The equation is a good model for the height of the cannonball from the time it is launched, \(t=0\), until the time it lands, just before \(t=20\). For times outside of these values, the function values do not mean anything in the context (for example, for \(t=21\) the function would place the cannonball underground).
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>Student-Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>If the cannonball were fired at 800 feet per second, would it reach a mile in height? Remember there are 5280 feet in a mile. Explain your reasoning.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The equation here would be \(g(t)=50+800t-16t^2\). Since \(g(10)=6450\) and there are 5280 feet in a mile, this cannonball would reach over a mile in height. This could also be seen by graphing the function.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their observations and interpretations of the graph. Highlight the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li> The graph representing a quadratic function is a parabola, which is a special kind of U shape. We will learn more about the geometry of this shape in a later course, but for now, notice that there is a point when the graph changes direction, from going up as \(x\) increases to going down (or changes from going down to going up). We call this point the vertex of the graph. </li>
<li> In the previous activity, we plotted a limited set of points, so we could not tell where the vertex of the graph was. In this graph, we are able to identify the vertex. In this situation, the vertex tells us the maximum height that the cannonball reaches and the number of seconds after launch that it took before it starts to fall. </li>
<li> In this graph, we can also see that the height of the cannonball is 0 when \(t\) is a little less than 20. That point, the horizontal intercept, relates to the zero of the function, or an input value that produces 0 for the output. In this situation, the zero tells us when the cannonball hits the ground. </li>
<li> Even though we can continue the graph beyond \(t = 20\), in this situation any output values beyond that point would not have any meaning. After the cannonball hits the ground, the function is no longer appropriate for modeling the movement of the cannonball. Likewise, the function is not appropriate before t=0 or before the cannon is fired. In this situation, a domain between 0 and just below 20 seconds is appropriate. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Reading Graphs of Quadratics</h4>
<p>An object is thrown upward from a height of 5 feet with a velocity of 60 feet per second. Its height, \(h(t)\), in feet after \(t\) seconds is modeled by the function \(h(t)=5+60t-16t^2\).</p>
<p><img alt="Graph of the quadratic function h(t)=5+60t&minus;16t2  on a coordinate plane, origin  O. Horizontal axis scale 0 to 4 by 1&rsquo;s, labeled &ldquo;time (seconds)&rdquo;. Vertical axis scale 0 to 80 by&nbsp;20&rsquo;s, labeled &ldquo;distance above ground (feet)&rdquo;. Some of the points of this function are (0 comma 5), (1 comma 49), to a maximum near (1 point 9 comma 61 point 2 5) then decreasing through (2 comma 61), (3 comma 41) and (3.8 comma 0)." height="231" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/32a38b72c84f4afe7093510818605bcc7a9b6d4f" width="311"></p>
<p>Step 1<br>Identify the starting height.<br>
    5 feet </p>
<p>Step 2<br>Identify the maximum height by looking at the vertex or peak of the parabola.<br>
    approximately 62 feet </p>
<p>Step 3<br>Identify when the object reaches its maximum by matching the maximum with its matching time from the \(x\)-axis.<br>
    approximately 1.75 seconds </p>
<p>Step 4<br>When does the object hit the ground?&nbsp;<br>
    Look at where the object has a height of 0 feet, or the zero of the function. This happens at approximately 3.75 seconds. Notice there would be another zero on the graph of the function to the left of \(x=0\), but that does not make sense in the problem because the object was thrown from 5 feet. </p>
