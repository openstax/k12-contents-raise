<p>In each situation, the inputs or \(x\)-values are increasing by 1 each time. These can also be called consecutive
  terms.</p>
<p>If you have consecutive terms, then:</p>
<ul>
  <li> If the difference between their corresponding outputs or \(y\)-values is always the same constant, then the
    input-output pairs in the table can be modeled by a linear function. </li>
  <li> If the quotient between their corresponding outputs or \(y\)-values is always the same constant, then the
    input-output pairs in the table can be modeled by an exponential function. A growth rate greater than one means that
    it is exponential growth, and a growth rate between zero and one means that it is exponential decay. </li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible for a table to be a set of values that is not any of these relationships.</p>
<p>Using this information, you can see that in Table A, \(\frac{\frac{1}{4}}{ \frac{1}{2}}=\frac12\). This holds true
  for the quotient of every other set of consecutive terms, too. Since the quotient is always the same, Table A
  represents an exponential function. Since the growth rate is \(\frac12\), or between zero and one, Table A represents
  exponential decay.</p>
<p>In Table B, the quotient of consecutive terms is not the same, but there is a common difference. The difference
  between the first two terms is \(2.5 -1.4=1.1\). This holds true for each of the other pairs of consecutive terms, so
  Table B represents a linear relationship.</p>
<p>In Table C, the quotient of consecutive terms is \(\frac{60}{30}=2\). This relationship holds true for all of the
  pairs of consecutive terms, which means this table represents an exponential relationship. Since the growth factor is
  greater than one, Table C represents exponential growth.</p>

  <p>Compare your answer:</p>
  <p>Here is how to determine which table is exponential growth:</p>
  <p>When looking for exponential growth, remember that each \(y\)-value should be greater than the previous one. By
    first checking for growth, you can eliminate Table B and Table D. In Table B, each term is less than the first one,
    so it is not exponential growth. In Table D, the values increase and decrease, so it is not exponential growth,
    either.</p>
  <p>Next, check for connections between consecutive terms. In Table A, \(2+6= 8\) and \(2 \cdot 4=8\). Since there
    seems to be the possibility of either a linear relationship or exponential growth, you need to check the next set of
    terms. Since \(8 \cdot 4 \neq 14\) and \(8+6 =14\), the relationship in Table A is linear, not exponential.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>This means the answer should be Table C, but we should always check to confirm. If we check consecutive terms in
    Table C for a growth factor, we get the following: \(\frac {16}{4}=4\), \(\frac{64}{16}=4\), and
    \(\frac{256}{64}=4\). This proves that the growth factor is 4 and Table C represents exponential growth.</p>
