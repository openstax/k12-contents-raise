<p>In this lesson, you will deepen your understanding of the solutions to linear inequalities by studying them in context. You will write inequalities in two variables to represent constraints, and interpret the points on a boundary line and on either side of it in terms of the situation.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Interpret points in the coordinate plane and decide if they are solutions to the inequality, given a two-variable inequality that represents a situation.</li>
  <li>Find the solutions to a two-variable inequality by using the graph of a related two-variable equation.</li>
  <li>Write inequalities to describe the constraints in a situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
