<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>The mathematical purpose of this
  activity is for students to practice using the term causal relationship
  and think of situations to which it might apply and where relationships
  are causal.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Tell students that people often
  use the phrase &ldquo;correlation, not causation&rdquo; or &ldquo;association, not
  causation&rdquo; to refer to situations in which there is a
  relationship, but it is not a causal relationship. A causal relationship means that a change in one of the variables actually <em>causes</em> a change in the other variable.</p>
<p>Arrange students in groups of
  2&ndash;4. Give students several minutes to record answers to the questions
  individually and then ask students to share their answers with each
  other and determine if the answer is correct.</p>
<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<div>
  <p>Use
    this routine to help students improve their writing by providing them
    with multiple opportunities to clarify their ideas through conversation.
    Give students time to meet with 2&ndash;3 partners to share their response to
    the last question. Students should first check to see if they agree
    with the experiment to show a correlation or causation. Provide
    listeners with prompts for feedback that will help their partner add
    detail to strengthen and clarify their ideas. For example, students can
    ask their partner: &ldquo;Why do you think these are not causal?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How
    would the data show if the relationship was correlation or causal?&rdquo; Next, provide students with 3&ndash;4 minutes to revise their initial draft
    based on feedback from their peers. This will help students understand
    relationships that may or may not be causal.</p>

<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>
<div>
  <p> <em>Engagement: Develop Effort and Persistence.</em>
    Encourage and support opportunities for peer collaboration. Prior to
    directing students&rsquo; attention to the task, invite students to brainstorm
    various pairs of variables (both with and without correlation).
    Encourage students to free-associate and build on each other&rsquo;s
    ideas. When students share their work with a partner, display sentence
    frames to support conversation, such as: &ldquo;_____ reminds me of _____
    because . . .&rdquo; and &ldquo;_____&rsquo;s idea reminds me of . . .&rdquo; After students
    have developed a list of several options, share the conditions list and
    then encourage them to analyze and select which one best fits each
    condition.<em><br></em></p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<div>
  <p>The phrases &ldquo;correlation, not causation&rdquo; or &ldquo;association, not causation&rdquo; are often used to refer to situations in which there is a relationship, but it is not a <strong>causal relationship</strong>. While <strong>correlation</strong> is used to describe the strength of the relationship between variables,&nbsp; a causal relationship means that a change in one of the variables actually causes a change in the other variable. <br></p>
  <p>Describe a pair of variables with each condition. Be prepared to show your reasoning.</p>
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent">
    <li>Two variables have a <strong>causal relationship</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>The variables are strongly related, but a third factor might be the cause for the changes in the variables.
    </li>
    <li>The variables are not related.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<p>Compare your answer:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Length
    of a person&rsquo;s foot in inches and their men&rsquo;s shoe size. Increased foot
    size would cause someone to purchase larger shoe sizes.</li>
  <li>Amount of power produced by
    solar panels and percentage of people wearing sunglasses while driving.
    These factors are probably strongly, positively related, but the cause
    is the amount of sunlight getting through to the ground for each
    variable rather than either one of the variables causing the other to
    increase directly.</li>
  <li>The number of hits by a
    certain baseball player per game for a season and the price of a barrel
    of oil on the day of the games. There is no reasonable relationship
    between the variables, and they are very unlikely to be related even by
    external causes.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>
    Look through news articles or
    advertisements for claims of causation or correlation. Find 2 or 3 claims
    and read or watch the articles or the advertisements. Answer these
    questions for each of the claims.

    <ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
      <li>
        <p>What is the claim?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What evidence is provided for the claim?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Does there appear to be evidence for causation or correlation? Explain your thinking.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose the claim with the least
    or no evidence. Describe an experiment or other way that you could
    collect data to show correlation or causation.

  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Extension Student Response</h4>
<p>Compare your answer:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>
    <ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
      <li>
        Claim 1: Green tea lowers blood pressure. Claim 2: Chocolate improves health. Claim 3: Soda helps with heartburn.
      </li>
      <li>
        Claim 1: Study groups were
        given either green tea or a drink that was colored like green tea for
        several weeks, and their blood pressure was taken before and after the
        study. Claim 2: They analyzed the number of antioxidants in chocolate as
        compared to fruit. Claim 3: No evidence was provided other than that it
        seemed to work for some people.
      </li>
      <li>
        Claim 1: There appears to be
        evidence for correlation because there was a control group, and the blood
        pressure was taken before and after drinking tea. However, there was no
        mention of how the groups were randomized or selected, so I am not sure
        if there is evidence for causation. Claim 2: The only evidence
        provided is the quantity of antioxidants chocolate contains, so a study would
        need to be done on antioxidants and health to show correlation or
        causation. Claim 3: There is no evidence for correlation or causation
        because only a testimonial is provided.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    To show that heartburn relief
    is correlated with or caused by drinking soda, I would have to randomly assign
    subjects to different treatment groups. One group would get soda, and
    the other would get a placebo. I would then need to collect and compare data about
    their heartburn symptoms to determine if there is correlation or
    causation.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may still wonder how
  two variables can be correlated without having a causal relationship. It
  may help to provide an example, such as sales of ice cream and sales of
  sunburn remedies. Ask students why these variables might be related and
  whether increasing one would cause the other variable to increase. Ask
  students to think of something that might cause two distinct outcomes to
  result.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>The goal of this discussion is
  for students to gain a deeper understanding of what it means for
  variables to have a causal relationship.</p>
<p>Here are some questions for discussion.</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Which
    pair of variables was the most difficult for you to describe? Explain
    your reasoning.&rdquo; (I had a hard time describing a pair of variables that
    were strongly related but where a third factor might be the cause. It
    was difficult because I kept coming up with causal relationships.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;For question 1, how did you
    convince yourself or your group that one variable causes a change in the
    other?&rdquo; (To convince them, I gave an example of using the variables in
    context. My two variables were snail weight and shell volume. When a
    snail has more weight, then it increases in volume, which means it needs
    a bigger shell.)</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-f1c8e6e7-7fff-8636-7934-003a818ac1eb"><em><strong>The following content is available to students who would like more support based on their experience with the self check. Students will not automatically have access to this content, so you may wish to share it with those who could benefit from it.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<h5>Is It Causation?</h5>
<p dir="ltr">Correlation means there is a relationship or pattern between the values of two variables. A scatter plot displays data about two variables as a set of points in the \( xy \)-plane and is a useful tool for determining if there is a correlation between the variables.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Causation means that one event causes another event to occur. Causation can only be determined from an appropriately designed experiment. In such experiments, similar groups receive different treatments, and the outcomes of each group are studied. We can only conclude that a treatment causes an effect if the groups have noticeably different outcomes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Why doesn&rsquo;t correlation mean causation?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even if there is a correlation between two variables, we cannot conclude that one variable causes a change in the other. This relationship could be coincidental, or a third factor may be causing both variables to change.</p>
<h5 dir="ltr">Example:</h5>
<p dir="ltr">Liam collected data on the sales of ice cream cones and air conditioners in his hometown. He found that when ice cream sales were low, air conditioner sales tended to be low, and that when ice cream sales were high, air conditioner sales tended to be high.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Liam can conclude that sales of ice cream cones and air conditioners are positively correlated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Liam can&rsquo;t conclude that selling more ice cream cones causes more air conditioners to be sold. It is likely that the increases in the sales of both ice cream cones and air conditioners are caused by a third factor, an increase in temperature!</p>
<h5>Try It: Is It Causation?</h5>
<p dir="ltr">Vivek notices that students in his class with larger shoe sizes tend to have higher grade point averages. Based on this observation, what is the best description of the relationship between shoe size and grade point average?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Write down your answer. Then select the <strong>solution </strong>button to compare your work.</p>
<h5 dir="ltr">Solution</h5>
<p dir="ltr">The relationship has a positive correlation because as shoe size increases, grade point average tends to increase. There is not a causal relationship.</p>
