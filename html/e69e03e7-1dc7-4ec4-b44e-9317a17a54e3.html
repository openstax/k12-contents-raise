<p>Describe and display the following situation to students. <a href="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/19727614179f5b441ea68e7458ce3f6e879bdf43" target="_blank">(PDF Link of this situation for whole class display.)</a>
</p>
<p>Suppose you are organizing a party and have a budget of \(b\) dollars for the appetizers. You plan to order \(v\)
  vegetarian spring rolls at $0.75 each and \(s\) shrimp rolls at $0.95 each. The equation \( 0.75v +
      0.95s = b \) represents this constraint.</p>
<p>Ask one half of the class to solve for \( v \) and the other half to solve for \( s \).</p>
<p>Then, ask students: &ldquo;When might it be most handy to use each of these equations in your party planning?&rdquo;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    \( 0.75v + 0.95s = b \) (When we want to find out how much different combinations of rolls would cost)
  </li>
  <li>
    \( v = \dfrac {b - 0.95s}{0.75} \) (When we know the budget and want to find out how many vegetarian rolls we could
    get if we order different numbers of shrimp rolls)
  </li>
  <li>
    \( s = \dfrac {b - 0.75v}{0.95} \) (When we know the budget and want to find out how many shrimp rolls we could get
    if we order different numbers of vegetarian rolls)
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
