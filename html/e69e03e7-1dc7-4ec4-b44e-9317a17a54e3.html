      <p>Describe and display the following situation to students.

      <div class="body">
        <p>Suppose you are organizing a party and have a budget of <span class="math math-repaired">\( b \)</span> dollars for the appetizers. You plan to order <span class="math math-repaired">\( v \)</span> vegetarian spring rolls at <span>$</span>0.75 each and <span class="math math-repaired">\( s \)</span> shrimp rolls at <span>$</span>0.95 each. The equation <span class="math math-repaired">\( 0.75v + 0.95s = b \)</span> represents this constraint.</p>
        <p>Ask one half of the class to solve for <span class="math math-repaired">\( v \)</span> and the other half to solve for <span class="math math-repaired">\( s \)</span>.</p>
        <p>Then, ask students: &ldquo;When might it be most handy to use each of these equations in your party planning?&rdquo;</p>

          <li>
            <span class="math math-repaired">\( 0.75v + 0.95s = b \)</span> (When we want to find out how much different combinations of rolls would cost)
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="math math-repaired">\( v = \dfrac {b - 0.95s}{0.75} \)</span> (When we know the budget and want to find out how many vegetarian rolls we could get if we order different numbers of shrimp rolls)
