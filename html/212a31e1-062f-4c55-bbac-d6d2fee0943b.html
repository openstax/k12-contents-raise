<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students encounter equations that contain rational numbers. They learn that, even though the numbers are not as straightforward as in equations they have previously seen, they can still solve the equations by completing the square. The less-friendly numbers and the more elaborate equations make the computations more challenging, so students need to attend to precision and mind the steps for rearranging parts of the equations, as well as the signs of the numbers, especially negative numbers.</p>
<p>As students work, they may need to be reminded to rewrite the equation in a different form, isolate a term to make it easier to complete the square, apply the zero product property only when a product is equal to zero, and so on. Make note of common errors or hurdles and address them during whole-class discussion.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Give students a moment to look at the list of equations and notice how they are like or unlike other equations they have seen and solved before. Invite students to share some observations. They may notice, for instance:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> \((x&minus;3)(x+1)=5\) does not have 0 on one side, so we cannot use the zero product property right away. </li>
  <li> \(x^2+\frac{1}{2}x=\frac{3}{16}\) and \(x^2+3x+\frac{8}{4}=0\) involve fractions. </li>
  <li> \(x^2+3x+\frac{8}{4}=0\) has an odd number for the coefficient of the linear term. </li>
  <li> \((7&minus;x)(3&minus;x)+3=0\) has 0 on one side but the other side is a sum, not a product. </li>
  <li> \(x^2+1.6x+0.63=0\) has decimals. </li>
</ul>
<p>Explain to students that each equation can be solved by completing the square and using the same reasoning as when we solved simpler-looking equations earlier.</p>
<p>Consider arranging students in groups of two. If there is not enough time for students to answer all the questions, consider asking students to look at the list of equations and to choose one they think looks easier (or more familiar) and one that looks harder (or less familiar).</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Completing the square can be used to solve quadratic equations.</p>
<p>Example: Solve \(x^2+8x-2=0\).</p>
<p>To complete the square to solve an equation, follow these steps:</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Write the equation in the form \(ax^2+bx=c\).<br>
  \(x^2+8x=-2\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Complete the square by finding \((\frac{b}{2})^2\).<br>
  \((\frac{b}{2})^2=(\frac{8}{2})^2=16\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Add the value to both sides of the equation.<br>
  \(x^2+8x+16=-2+16\)</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  Factor the perfect square trinomial and simplify the constants.<br>
  \((x+4)^2=14\)</p>
<p>Step 5<br>
  Take the square root of each side (remember the plus-minus sign with the constant).<br>
  \(\sqrt{(x+4)^2}=\sqrt{14}\)<br>
  \(x+4= \pm \sqrt{14}\)</p>
<p>Step 6<br>
  Write two separate equations and solve each.<br>
  \(x + 4 = \sqrt{14}\) &nbsp;or&nbsp; \(x + 4 =\; - \;\sqrt{14}\)<br>
  \(x = -4 + \sqrt{14}\) &nbsp;or&nbsp; \(x =\; -\;4\; -\; \sqrt{14}\)</p>
<p>Solve each equation by completing the square. In part a, select the value of \((\frac{b}{2})^2\) that will complete the square. In part b, choose the <strong>two </strong>roots.</p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may have a difficult time getting started given the increased complexity of these problems. Encourage these students to use completing the square to solve a more familiar problem first, such as \(x^2&minus;10x+20=4\), and then to use the structure of the process they followed as a guide to help them solve these more challenging problems.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students to share their solutions and display their work for all to see. If students found solutions that differ from each other, as time permits, invite these students to describe their thinking to the class, and encourage them to try to identify any errors and determine which solutions are correct. Discuss any common challenges or errors.</p>
<p>Make sure students understand that the process of solving by completing the square is the same whether the numbers in the equations are integers or other rational numbers. Elicit from students a generalization of the process. For example:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Start with a quadratic expression in standard form on one side of the equal sign and a number (which could be 0) on the other side. </li>
  <li> Take half of the coefficient of the linear term and square it. The result is the constant term that would make the quadratic expression a perfect square. </li>
  <li> Perform the same operations to both sides of the equal sign so that the constant term that is on one side is a perfect square that makes the expression a perfect square. </li>
  <li> Rewrite the expression (in standard form) as a squared factor. </li>
  <li> Find both values of the factor that, when squared, give the number on the other side of the equal sign. </li>
</ul>
<p>To scaffold instruction, provide a blank template with the steps for students to follow as they solve equations.</p>

        <p>That's correct! Check yourself: Move the \(\frac94\) to the other side of the equation then complete the square and add \(\frac{25}{4}\) to each side. Take the square root of each side then factor. The equation becomes \(x+ \frac{5}{2}= \pm \;2\). Solve for \(x\) and these are the zeros.</p>

<p><strong><em>The following content is available to students who would like more support based on their experience with the self check. Students will not automatically have access to this content, so you may wish to share it with those who could benefit from it.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<h4>Completing the Square with Fractions</h4>
<p>Completing the square can be a useful method for solving quadratic equations in cases in which it is not easy to rewrite an expression in factored form. For example, let's solve this equation:</p>
<p>\(x^2 + 5x - \frac{75}{4}=0\)</p>
<p>First, we'll add \(\frac{75}{4}\) to each side to make things easier on ourselves.</p>
<p>\(x^2+5x-\frac{75}{4}+\frac{75}{4}=0+\frac{75}{4}\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(x^2+5x=\frac{75}{4}\)</p>
<p>To complete the square, take \(\frac12\) of the coefficient of the linear term 5, which is \(\frac52\), and square it, which is \(\frac{25}{4}\). Add this to each side:</p>
<p>\(x^2 +5x +\frac{25}{4}=\frac{75}{4}+\frac{25}{4}\)</p>
<p>&nbsp;\(x^2+5x +\frac{25}{4}=\frac{100}{4}\) </p>
<p>Notice that \(\frac{100}{4}\) is equal to 25 and rewrite it:</p>
<p>\(x^2+5x+\frac{25}{4}=25\)</p>
<p>Since the left side is now a perfect square, let's rewrite it:</p>
<p>\((x+\frac{5}{2})^2=25\)</p>
<p>For this equation to be true, one of these equations must be true:</p>
<p>\(x+\frac{5}{2}=5\) or \(x+\frac{5}{2}=-5\)</p>
<p>To finish up, we can subtract \(\frac52\) from each side of the equal sign in each equation.</p>
<p>\(x=5-\frac52\) or \(x=-5-\frac52\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(x=\frac52\) or \(x=-\frac{15}{2}\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\(x=2\frac12\) or \(x=-7\frac12\)</p>
<p>It takes some practice to become proficient at completing the square, but it makes it possible to solve many more equations than you could by methods you learned previously.</p>

<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to find the zeros after using completing the square:</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Add the constant to the other side of the equation.<br>
  \(x^2+3x=4\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Complete the square.<br>
  \((\frac{3}{2})^2=\frac94\)</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Add the constant to each side.<br>
  \(x^2+3x+\frac{9}{4}=\frac{16}{4}+\frac94\)</p>
<p>Step 4<br>
  Simplify and factor the perfect square trinomial.<br>
  \((x+\frac{3}{2})^2=\frac{25}{4}\)</p>
<p>Step 5<br>
  Take the square root of both sides of the equation.<br>
  \(x+\frac{3}{2}= \pm \frac{5}{2}\)</p>
<p>Step 6<br>
  Write the two equations and solve.&nbsp;<br>
  \(x+\frac{3}{2}=\frac{5}{2}\) and \(x+\frac{3}{2}=-\frac{5}{2}\)<br>
  \(x=1\) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \(x=-4\)</p>
