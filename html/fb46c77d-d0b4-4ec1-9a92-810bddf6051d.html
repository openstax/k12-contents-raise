<h3>Warm Up (10 minutes)</h3>
<p>When they write expressions in factored form later in the lesson, students will need to reason about factors that yield certain products. This warm up prompts students to find unknown factors in the context of area puzzles. Solving the puzzles involves reasoning about the measurements in multiple steps.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Give students a few minutes of quiet time to think individually and then time to share their thinking with their partner. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Examine the two puzzles that involve side lengths and areas of rectangles. Can you find the missing area in Figure A and the missing length in Figure B? Be prepared to explain your reasoning.</p>
<p>Figure A</p>

  <li> What is the missing area in Figure A above? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>To determine the area of the blue rectangle, we need to figure out it&rsquo;s width and length.     </p>
<p>The top shape is a square measuring 8 in. x 8 in.  If the measurement of the longer left side is 10 inches, then the width of the blue rectangle can be an equation.     </p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}8 + W &amp;=&amp; 10 \\ W &amp;=&amp; 2  \end{array}\)</p>
<p>The width of the rectangle is 2 inches. </p>
<p>Because the bottom of the square is 8 inches, the length of the blue rectangle can be written as an equation.  But we have an unknown \(z\).   </p>
<p>\(L = 8 + z\)</p>
<p>If we look at the measurements of the smaller square, we see that we can use an equation to calculate \(z\). </p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}z + 3 &amp;=&amp; 5 \\ z &amp;=&amp; 2 \end{array}\)</p>
<p>Now, we can substitute the 2 for \(z\) in the length equation.     </p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}L &amp;=&amp; 8 + 2 \\   L &amp;=&amp; 10 \end{array}\)</p>
<p>The area of the blue rectangle is \(8 x 10 \)to equal 80 square inches.</p>

<p>Figure B</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li> What is the missing length in Figure B above? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>You have to start with what you know and can figure out the other sides.      </p>
<p>Sides of orange rectangle   </p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}L \cdot W  &amp;=&amp; Area \\ 12W &amp;=&amp; 60  \\ W &amp;=&amp; 5 \end{array}\)</p>
<p>Sides of green rectangle   </p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}L \cdot W  &amp;= &amp;Area  \\ (5+3) \cdot W &amp;=&amp; 48 \\ 8w &amp;=&amp; 48 \\ w &amp;=&amp; 6 \end{array}\)</p>
<p>Sides of combined rectangles  </p>
<p>The measurement of the long side of combined orange and green rectangle will be equal.  This helps figure out one side of the blue rectangle.     </p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}12 + 6 &amp;=&amp; 3 + w + 11 \\ 18&amp; = &amp;w + 14 \\ w &amp;= &amp;4 \end{array}\)</p>
<p>Sides of blue rectangle    </p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}L \cdot W&amp;  =&amp; Area \\ L\cdot 4 &amp;=&amp; 36  \\ L &amp;= &amp;9\end{array}\)</p>
<br>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Display the images for all to see. Invite students to share their responses and how they reasoned about the missing values, using the diagrams to illustrate their thinking.</p>
<p>After the solution to the second puzzle is presented, draw students&rsquo; attention to the rectangle with area 36 sq. in. Point out that, without reasoning about other parts of the puzzle, we cannot know which two numbers are multiplied to get 36 sq. in. (The numbers may not be whole numbers.) But by reasoning about other parts, we can conclude what the missing length must be.</p>
<p>Emphasize that in this lesson, they will also need to find two factors that yield a certain product and to reason logically about which numbers the factors can or must be.</p>
