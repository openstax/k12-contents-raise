<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Factor trinomials of the form \(x^2 + bx + c\). </li>
  <li> Factor trinomials of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\) using trial and error. </li>
  <li> Factor trinomials of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\) using the &ldquo;\(ac\)&rdquo; method. </li>
  <li> Factor using substitution. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 6.5.1: Undoing FOIL </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you learned the steps used to factor a trinomial by reversing the FOIL method. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 6.5.2: Factoring Trinomials with Leading Coefficients of 1<ul>
      <li> In this activity, you learned how to factor any trinomial of the form \(x^2 + bx + c\). By finding the factors of the \(c\) term and checking to see if they add up to the \(b\) term, you are able to find the factors of a trinomial of this form. </li>
      <li> 6.5.2: Self Check</li>
      <li>6.5.2: Additional Resources</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> 6.5.3: Factoring Trinomials Using Trial and Error
    <ul>
      <li> In this activity, you learned that you sometimes need to factor out the GCF from a trinomial as the first step to factoring. You also learned some tricks to help determine the factors of a trinomial, such as when the middle term is negative and the last term is positive, the signs in the binomial factors must both be negative. You practiced finding the factors of a trinomial of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\) using a trial and error method. </li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> 6.5.4: Factoring Trinomials Using the &ldquo;\(ac\)&rdquo; Method and Substitution
    <ul>
      <li> In this activity, you learned a method that can be used to factor any trinomial, the &ldquo;\(ac\)&rdquo; method. By finding two numbers that multiply to \(ac\) and add to \(b\), you can factor the trinomial by grouping. You also learned a substitution method that allows you to factor trinomials that do not appear to fit into the \(ax^2 + bx + c\) form at first. </li>

  </li>
  <li> 6.5.5: Choosing Your Own Method to Factor Trinomials </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you combined everything you learned in the lesson to choose your own preferred method to factor a trinomial.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following<strong> practice</strong>:</p>
