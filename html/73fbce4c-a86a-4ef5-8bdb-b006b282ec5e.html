<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity prompts students to analyze two quadratic functions&mdash;one represented by a graph, and the other by an equation&mdash;and solve a problem. Graphs can make it easier to compare functions, but because students are asked not to graph the second function, they need to rely on their knowledge of the connections between equations and their graphs to make the comparison. To answer the questions, students have to interpret various pieces of the given information (the graph, the numbers in the equation, the descriptions in the questions, etc.), allowing them to reason quantitatively and abstractly.</p>
<p>As students work, look for students who reason in the ways outlined in the Activity Synthesis so they can share their thinking later.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Give students a moment to read the task statement. Make sure students understand what it means for a baseball to "stay in flight."</p>
<p>Consider keeping students in groups of two and asking them to think quietly before discussing their thinking with a partner.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here is a graph that represents the height of a baseball, \(h\), in feet as a function of time, \(t\), in seconds after it was hit by Player A.</p>
<p><img alt="Horizontal axis, time in seconds. Vertical axis, height in feet. Parabola, opens down, x intercepts at about -0.62 and about 5.12, vertex = 2 point 5 comma 105." height="213" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/719350de85b749cac26a9fe76d9d4d9989353b8a" width="318"></p>
<p>The function \(g\) defined by \(g(t)=(-16t&minus;1)(t&minus;4)\) also represents the height in feet of a baseball \(t\) seconds after it was hit by Player B. Without graphing function \(g\), answer the following questions and explain or show how you know.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>Which player's baseball stayed in flight longer?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Player A's baseball stayed in flight longer. The zeros of function \(g\) are 4 and \(\frac{-1}{16}\). The negative zero doesn't have any meaning in this situation. A zero in this situation means the time when the baseball has a height of 0 (or when it hits the ground). For Player B, this happened when \(t=4\) or 4 seconds after it was hit. Player A's baseball hit the ground a little over 5 seconds after it was hit.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li>Which player's baseball reached a greater maximum height?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Player A's baseball reached a greater maximum height. From the graph for Player A, it looks like the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex is around 105 feet. For Player B, the vertex of the graph has a \(t\)-coordinate of about 2 (halfway between \(\frac{-1}{16}\) and 4). We can find \(g(2)\) to estimate the height at that point. \(g(2)=(-16(2)&minus;1)(2&minus;4)=(-33)(-2)=66\), so the highest point of Player B's baseball was around 66 feet.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
<li>Based on the graph, what is the approximate height, in feet, of Player A&rsquo;s baseball when hit? How do you know?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> We can look at the \(y\)-intercept of the graph, and it looks like the \(y\)-coordinate is about 5.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
<li>What is the height, in feet, of Player B&rsquo;s baseball when hit?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 4 feet. Find the height when \(t=0\). \(g(0)=(-16(0)&minus;1)(0&minus;4)=(-1)(-4)=4\), so it was hit at 4 feet.</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may find it challenging to find the zeros of function \(g\) because of the -16 in \(-16t-1\). Support these students' reasoning about the equation \(-16t-1=0\) by asking whether this equation will have a positive or negative solution and whether it will have a solution close to 0 or not. Another challenge students may face is estimating the location of the vertex. Point out the graph of \(h\) and ask them how the vertex relates to the horizontal intercepts. It is not expected that students will compute the precise location by averaging \(\frac{-1}{16}\) and 4. Encourage them to use the number between 0 and 4 as a good estimate of the \(t\)-coordinate of the vertex. Encourage struggling students to use technology to graph \(g\) to check their thinking.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their responses and reasoning. If not mentioned in students' explanations, highlight the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li> To determine which baseball stayed in flight longer, we can compare where the graphs intersect the horizontal axis or the zeros of the functions, which tell us when the baseball hits the ground. </li>
<ul>
<li> The graph of function \(h\) intersects the horizontal axis around 5. </li>
<li> Function \(g\) is given in factored form, so one zero will be a very small negative number (about \(\frac{-1}{16}\)), and the other zero will be 4. </li>
</ul>
<li> The maximum height of Player A's baseball (function \(h\)) is shown in the graph. For Player B (function \(g\)), we can approximate the halfway point between the horizontal intercepts, which is around \(t=2\), and then find \(g(2)\). </li>
<li> The baseball was hit at \(t=0\), so to find the height we would look at the vertical intercept (\(y\)-intercept). </li>
<ul>
<li> For function \(h\), this point is shown on the graph. </li>
<li> For function \(g\), it is not immediately apparent because the equation is in factored form. If it was in standard form, the constant term is the vertical intercept. We can either expand the \((-16t-1)(t-4)\) and write an equivalent expression in standard form, or find \(g(0)\). </li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>Comparing the Graphs and Equations of Quadratic Functions</h4>
<p>Jai kicks a football. The graph that represents the height of the football, \(h\), as a function of time, in seconds, is below.</p>
<p><img alt class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="261" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/d10667556156ef8039bcaf02b8679ef27a889a6f" width="259"></p>
<p>Kellan kicks a football and the height in feet, \(h\), is represented by the function \(h(t)=(-16t-1)(t-6)\).</p>
<p>Which player&rsquo;s football stayed in the air longer?</p>
<p>Jai&rsquo;s football landed after 4 seconds since the zero is at \(x=4\). The other zero, where \(x\) is negative, does not make sense in this problem.</p>
<p>Looking at the function of Kellan&rsquo;s ball, find the zeros by setting each factor equal to zero.</p>
<ul>
<li> \(-16t-1=0\) becomes \(t=\frac{-1}{16}\). A negative time does not make sense in this problem. </li>
<li> \(t-6=0\) becomes \(t=6\). </li>
</ul>
<p>Kellan&rsquo;s ball was in the air for 6 seconds, so his ball stayed in the air 2 seconds longer than Jai&rsquo;s.</p>
<h4>Try It: Comparing the Graphs and Equations of Quadratic Functions</h4>
<p>Using the same information above, which player&rsquo;s football reached a higher height?</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to determine whose ball went higher:</p>
<p>Looking at the graph of Jai&rsquo;s football, his football went about 70 feet high.</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  For Kellan&rsquo;s football, find the vertex.<br>
  The vertex is halfway between the zeros. Since \(\frac{-1}{16}\) is near 0 and the other \(x\)-intercept is at 6, we can use 3 as an estimate for the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex.</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Substitute this into the function:<br>
  \(h(t)=(-16(3)-1)((3)-6)=(-49)(-3)=147\).</p>
<p>Kellan&rsquo;s ball went 147 feet into the air so his football went higher.</p>
