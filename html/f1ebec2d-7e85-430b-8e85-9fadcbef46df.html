<h4>Making Predictions Using a Quadratic Model</h4>
<p>A filtration system is being tested in a new aquarium. A pollutant is continuously added to the aquarium, and the filtration system is turned on until it has removed all of the pollutant from the water.</p>
<p>The following data set shows the milliliters (mL) of pollutant present, \(y\), corresponding to the number of minutes that have passed, \(x\), since the experiment started.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s enter the instruction line, \(y_1 \sim ax_1^2+bx_1+ c\), to find the curve of best fit.</p>

<p>The curve of best fit is determined to be \(y = -0.29x^2+ 37.74x + 95.95\).</p>
<p>We can use this curve of best fit to answer questions and make predictions about the amount of pollutant that will be in the water (mL) and the time it takes to completely clean the tank of pollutant.</p>
<p>How many mL of pollutant will be in the water after 12 minutes?</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> To answer this question, we want to know the \(y\)-value on the curve of best fit when the \(x\)-value is 12. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> We can graph the line \(x = 12\) and see where it intersects with the curve of best fit. </li>
</ul>

A VERTICAL LINE IS DRAWN THROUGH X EQUALS 12, WITH THE POINT (12, 507.492) LABELED." height="296" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c0cf9e0de60c8680edd67e2edee49e7ef614fe35" width="624"></p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> By moving the cursor over the intersection point, we see that the \(y\)-value is approximately 507.49. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> This means that after 12 minutes, there will be approximately 507.49 mL of pollutant in the water. </li>
</ul>
<p>At what time(s) will there be 1000 mL of pollutant in the water?</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> To answer this question, we want to know the \(x\)-value on the curve of best fit when the \(y\)-value is 1000. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> We can graph the line \(y = 1000\) and see where it intersects with the curve of best fit. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="A QUADRATIC REGRESSION THAT CLOSELY APPROXIMATES THE 6 PLOTTED POINTS. R-SQUARED IS APPROXIMATELY 0.99. THE OUTPUT SUMMARY SHOWS THAT A, B, AND C ARE APPROXIMATELY NEGATIVE 0.29, 37.74, AND 95.95, RESPECTIVELY. A HORIZONTAL LINE IS DRAWN THROUGH Y EQUALS ONE THOUSAND, WITH THE POINTS (31.508, 1000) AND (99.913, 1000) LABELED." height="272" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/9acf6d93d76789a2ee4808e96d3f123c2099fd16" width="624"></p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> The line \(y = 1000\) intersects with the curve of best fit at two points. This means there are two times when there is 1000 mL of pollutant. We see that the \(x\)-values are approximately 31.51 and 99.91. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> In other words, there will be 1000 mL of pollutant at approximately 31.51 minutes and again at approximately 99.91 minutes after the experiment starts. </li>
</ul>
<p>How long after the experiment has started will the filtration system have removed all of the pollutant from the aquarium?</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> To answer this question, we want to know the \(x\)-value of the \(x\)-intercept of the curve of best fit. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> If we graph \(y = 0\), we can click on the intersection point to find its coordinates. The \(x\)-intercept of the curve of best fit is \((133.92, 0)\). </li>
</ul>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> So, approximately 133.92 minutes after the experiment starts, there will be no pollutant left in the water. </li>
