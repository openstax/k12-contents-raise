<p>The purpose of this lesson is for students to understand what is meant by a minimum or maximum value of a function and ways to approach finding a maximum or minimum value given a function expressed in any form. Display this expression for all to see: \(-x^2&minus;6x&minus;2\).</p>
<p>Ask students to consider how they would go about deciding whether the function had a maximum or minimum value, and how they would determine what the maximum or minimum value is. It is not necessary to actually determine this value for the example. After a few minutes of quiet time to think individually, invite them to share their approach with a partner. Time permitting, select a few students to share with the class. Some possible approaches are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Since the coefficient of \(x^2\) is negative, I know the graph of the function opens downward, so the function has a maximum value. </li>
  <li> I could use technology to graph the function and see if the graph has a largest \(y\)-coordinate, so the function has a maximum value, or a smallest \(y\)-coordinate, so the function has a minimum value. </li>
  <li> I could use the quadratic equation to find the zeros, and since I know the vertex is exactly in between the zeros, I could determine the value of the midpoint of the two zeros and then substitute that value into the function to determine its output. Then I could compare this output to any other output value and see if it was larger or smaller. </li>
  <li> I could rewrite the expression in vertex form to see the coordinates of the vertex. Then, I could think about \(x\)-values on either side, and whether their corresponding \(y\)-values were greater than or less than the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex. </li>
</ul>
