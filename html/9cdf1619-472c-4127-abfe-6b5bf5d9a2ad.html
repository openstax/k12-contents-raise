<h3>Activity (10 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity gives students a chance to use mathematical language to describe relationships that are functions and
  to practice sketching a graph of a function given a description. The context is the same as in the previous activity,
  but the quantities are different.</p>
<p>Deciding on which variable is independent and which is dependent, as well as sketching a graph of the relationship,
  engages students in aspects of modeling. These activities require students to make sense of quantities, consider how
  they are related, and think about what values are reasonable. Using the language of functions to articulate the
  relationship between variables is an opportunity to attend to precision.</p>
<p>When sketching a graph for the function that defines the number of barks, students are likely to create either a
  discrete graph or a continuous graph. (Because the total number of barks cannot be fractional, creating a step graph
  would most accurately represent it as a function of time, but students are not expected to do so at this point.)
  Identify students who sketch each kind of graph. If time permits, select them to share their thoughts during class
  discussion.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Tell students their task is to analyze two pairs of quantities from a familiar
  situation. Ask partners to each choose a different pair of quantities. Give students a few minutes of quiet work time,
  and then give time for partners to take turns sharing their functions and representations.</p>
<p>Tell students that the partner who is listening should listen for the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How did their partner decide which quantity is independent (the input) and which is dependent (the output)?</li>
  <li>How did they decide what makes ____ a function of ____?</li>
  <li>How does the graph represent the relationship between ____ and ____?</li>
  <li>On the graph, how was the scale for each axis determined?</li>
</ul>
<p>Encourage students to notice any part of their own or their partner&rsquo;s statement or graph that may not seem
  reasonable in the situation, and then think about what might be more reasonable. (For instance, it is not reasonable
  for a dog to bark 1,000 times in 2 minutes.)</p>
<p>Leave 1&ndash;2 minutes for a whole-class discussion.</p>

<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>In a function, there are two quantities called <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0"
    data-store="glossary-tooltip">variables</span>. The <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0"
    data-store="glossary-tooltip">independent variable</span> is the input, while the <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip"
    data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">dependent variable</span> is the output.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are two pairs of quantities from a situation you&rsquo;ve seen in this lesson. Each pair has a relationship that
  can be defined as a function.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Time, in seconds, since the dog owner left and the total number of times the dog has barked</li>
  <li>Time, in seconds, since the owner left and the total distance, in feet, that the dog has walked while waiting</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose one pair of quantities and express their relationship as a function.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>In that function, which variable is independent? Which one is dependent?</li>
  <p> <strong>ANSWER: </strong> The time, in seconds, since the owner left is independent. The total number of times the
    dog has barked is dependent.<br>The time, in seconds, since the owner left is independent. The total distance, in
    feet, the dog walked while waiting is dependent.</p>
  <li>Write a sentence of the form &ldquo;____ is a function of ____.&rdquo;</li>
  <p><strong>ANSWER: </strong> The total number of times the dog has barked is a function of the time, in seconds, since
    the owner left.
    <br>The total distance, in feet, is a function of time, in seconds, since the owner left.
  </p>
  <li>Sketch a possible graph of the relationship on the coordinate plane. Be sure to label and indicate a scale on each
    axis, and be prepared to explain your reasoning.

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Because we often identify the input of a function first, some students may think that the independent variable always
  goes first in the statement &ldquo;___ is a function of ____.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Explain that we can think of the phrase &ldquo;is a function of&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;depends on.&rdquo; Suggest that
  they use &ldquo;depends on&rdquo; to describe the relationship between the quantities both ways and see which one
  makes more sense. For example, &ldquo;The dog&rsquo;s distance from the post depends on the time since the owner
  left,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the time since the owner left depends on the dog&rsquo;s distance from the post.&rdquo; The
  former makes more sense, so we can say, &ldquo;The dog&rsquo;s distance from the post is a function of time since the
  owner left.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>For each situation, select 1&ndash;2 students who drew different graphs to display them for all to see. Ask the
  students to briefly explain how they decided which quantity should be the input and which should be the output, as
  well as what the graph should look like.</p>

<h4>Identifying if a Relationship Is a Function</h4>
<p>A function is a relation in which each possible input value leads to exactly one output value. We say &ldquo;the
  output is a function of the input.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Given a relationship between two quantities, determine whether the relationship is a
  function.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Identify the input values.</li>
  <li>Identify the output values.</li>
  <li>If each input value leads to only one output value, classify the relationship as a function. If any input value
    leads to two or more outputs, do not classify the relationship as a function.</li>
</ol>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 1:</p>
<p>The coffee shop menu, shown below, consists of items and their prices.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
  <li>Is price a function of the item?</li>
  <li>Is the item a function of the price?</li>
</ol>
<p><img

<br>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
  <li>Let&rsquo;s begin by considering the input values as the items on the menu. The output values are then the prices.
    Each item on the menu has only one price, so the price is a function of the item.</li>
  <li>Two items on the menu have the same price. If we consider the prices to be the input values and the items to be
    the output, then the same input value could have more than one output associated with it. See the image below.
    Therefore, the item is a not a function of price.</li>

<br>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>For any percent grade earned, there is an associated grade point average, so the grade point average is a function of
  the percent grade. In other words, if we input the percent grade, the output is a specific grade point average.</p>
<p>In the grading system given, there is a range of percent grades that correspond to the same grade point average. For
  example, students who receive a grade point average of 3.0 could have a variety of percent grades ranging from 78 all
  the way to 86. Thus, percent grade is not a function of grade point average.</p>
