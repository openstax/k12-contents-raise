<h4>Activity (10 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity allows students to practice finding and interpreting average rates of change in a different context. No tables of values are given here, so students will need to estimate the coordinates on the graph to compute the average rates of change.</p>
<p>Students reason quantitatively and abstractly as they extract contextual information from a graph, manipulate it symbolically, and then interpret the numerical results in context. To interpret the average rates of change, students need to pay attention to the units used to measure the input (years) and output (people in millions). This is a chance to practice attending to precision.</p>

<h4>Student Activity </h4>
<p>The graphs show the populations of California and Texas over time.</p>
<p><img alt="Graph of the populations of two states over time on a coordinate plane." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/127fe8074872a6c9489127ecd8679d6c4f86ec31"></p>

<!-- Question 1 -->
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>Estimate the average rate of change in the population in California between 1970 and 2010. Be prepared to show your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The population of California was about 20 million in 1970 and 37 million in 2010. The average rate of change is: \(\frac{37-20}{2010-1970}=\frac{17}{40}=0.425\) million per year.</p>

<!-- Question 2 -->
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>In this situation, what does the rate of change mean for California?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> On average, the population of California was growing by 425,000 people per year.</p>

<!-- Question 3 -->
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>Estimate the average rate of change in the population in Texas between 1970 and 2010. Be prepared to show your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The population of Texas was about 11 million in 1970 and 25 million in 2010. The average rate of change is \(\frac{25-11}{2010-1970}=\frac{14}{40}=0.35\) million per year.</p>

<!-- Question 4 -->
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>In this situation, what does the rate of change mean for Texas?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> On average, the population of Texas was growing by 350,000 people per year.</p>

<!-- Question 5 -->
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>Which stateâ€™s population grew more quickly between 1900 and 2000? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> California is growing more quickly. For example: If we connect each pair of points representing the population of each state in 1900 and 2000, the segment for California has a greater slope, so it has a greater average rate of change.</p>

<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>The interpretation of the slope is the most difficult part of this section. It&rsquo;s often hard for students to think about the points on the graph as meaningful pieces of data. Try to talk about each coordinate as the data value it represents. Again remind students that the \(y\)-values are on top of the average rate of change formula, so the meaning of the slope is always \(y\) units per&nbsp;\(x\) unit. Sometimes it helps to point out slope as a unit rate, or the rate of change over 1 \(x\)-axis unit.</p>
<h4> Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>When calculating average rates of change for the populations of California and Texas between 1970 and 2010, students are likely to get slightly different results from one another. Discuss why this might be. If not mentioned by students, point out that it is most likely due to differences in how they estimated the populations from the graphs.</p>
<p>Invite students to share their response to the last question. Make sure students recognize that it is not always necessary to compute average rates of change or slopes of lines to compare the trends of two functions. We can visually compare the steepness of the lines connecting the endpoints of each graph.</p>

The listener should press for detail and precision in language by asking: &ldquo;Can you say that a different way?&rdquo;; &ldquo;Does your method work using a different time interval?&rdquo;; or &ldquo;Besides computing the average rate of change, can you think of another way to determine this?&rdquo; Invite students to go back and revise or refine their written explanation based on the feedback from peers.

        Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: 3.6 is the change in distance. When finding the average rate of change, you need to find the change in the distance and the change in the time.

<h4>Interpreting Slope</h4>
<p>A Mars rover collected the following temperature data over 1.6 Martian days. A Martian day is called a Sol. Use the graph to answer the following questions.</p>
<p><img alt="A GRAPH THAT SHOWS THE POPULATION IN MILLIONS FROM 1900 TO 2010 FOR THE STATES OF CALIFORNIA AND TEXAS." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/f26a0f890b9bda1d224b42d76a95bfc7be558b8a" width="800"></p>
<p>Which had a greater average rate of change between 10.2 and 10.4 Sol, ground temperature or air temperature? What is the meaning of each rate change?</p>
<p>Since ground temperature has a greater slant or slope, it has a greater rate of change. Slope is another word for the rate of change of a graph.</p>
<p>To find the average rate of change, first you need to find Sol on the graph (which is what a day is called on Mars). Find the values of 10.2 and 10.4 on the \(x\)-axis. Find the corresponding \(y\)-values of the points for both the ground temperature and air temperature graphs. By finding the average rate of change, you will be able to determine exactly one was greater.</p>
<p>Ground Temperature: \((10.2, -90)\) \((10.4, -20)\)</p>
<p>Air Temperature: \((10.2, -70 )\) \((10.4, -40)\)</p>
<p>Substitute each set of points into the average rate of change formula:</p>
<p>Ground Temperature = \(\frac{-20-(-90)}{10.4-10.2}=\frac{70}{0.2}=350\)</p>
<p>Air Temperature = \(\frac{-40-(-70)}{10.4-10.2}=\frac{30}{0.2}=150\)</p>
<p>Remember that to interpret the meaning of the rate of change, you need to compare the axes. It is the change in the \(y\)-axis units divided by the change in the \(x\)-axis units, or \(\frac{\mathrm{change}\;\mathrm{in}\;\mathrm{temperature}\;\mathrm{in}\;\mathrm{degrees}\;\mathrm{celsius}}{\mathrm{change}\;\mathrm{in}\;\mathrm{Sol}}\). That means that each average rate of change of each can be interpreted as:</p>
<p>Ground Temperature&rsquo;s average rate of change is 350 degrees celsius per Sol (or day on Mars).</p>
<p>Air Temperature&rsquo;s average rate of change is 150 degrees celsius per Sol (or day on Mars).</p>
<h4>Try It: Interpreting Slope</h4>

<p>Which had a greater average rate of change between 10.6 and 11 Sol, ground temperature or air temperature? What is the meaning of each rate change?</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Here is how to find the average rate of change:</p>
<p>To find the average rate of change, first you need to find Sol on the graph (which is what a day is called on Mars). Find the values of 10.6 and 11 on the \(x\)-axis. Find the corresponding \(y\)-values of the points for both the ground temperature and air temperature graphs. By finding the average rate of change, you will be able to determine&nbsp; which one was greater.</p>
<p>Ground Temperature: \((10.6, -3 )\) \((11, -85 )\)</p>
<p>Air Temperature: \((10.6, -5 )\) \((11, -65 )\)</p>
<p>Substitute each set of points into the average rate of change formula:</p>
<p>Ground Temperature = \(\frac{-85-(-3)}{11-10.6}=\frac{-82}{0.4}=-205\)</p>
<p>Air Temperature = \(\frac{-65-(-5)}{11-10.6}=\frac{-60}{0.4}=-150\)</p>
<p>Remember that to interpret the meaning of the rate of change, you need to compare the axes. It is the change in the \(y\)-axis units divided by the change in the \(x\)-axis units, or \(\frac{\mathrm{change}\;\mathrm{in}\;\mathrm{temperature}\;\mathrm{in}\;\mathrm{degrees}\;\mathrm{celsius}}{\mathrm{change}\;\mathrm{in}\;\mathrm{Sol}}\). That means that each average rate of change of each can be interpreted as:</p>
<p>Ground Temperature&rsquo;s average rate of change is &ndash;205 degrees celsius per Sol (or day on Mars).</p>
<p>Air Temperature&rsquo;s average rate of change is &ndash;150 degrees celsius per Sol (or day on Mars).</p>
<p>The ground temperature had a greater rate of decrease per Sol.</p>
