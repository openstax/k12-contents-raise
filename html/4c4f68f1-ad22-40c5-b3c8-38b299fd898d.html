<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity prompts students to look at how horizontal dilations (stretches or compressions) affect the graph of a linear function. Circulate to ensure students are graphing their lines properly. If necessary, partner students during the graphing process.</p>
<p>In pairs, students should discuss the horizontal changes to the parent function, \(ùëì(ùë•)=ùë•,\) to graph the new functions.</p>
<h5>Launch</h5>
<p>Ask students if they have ever squished a jumbo marshmallow with their fingers or pulled one apart. Students may have similar experiences with play doh, silly putty, clay, etc. You may choose to provide students with one of these types of manipulative. </p>
<p>Have students discuss what happens to the marshmallow when they squish it horizontally from the sides (the top and bottom expand - or it grows ‚Äúout‚Äù in the vertical direction). </p>
<p>Next, have students discuss what happens to the marshmallow as they pull it horizontally from the sides (the sides grow out horizontally and the top/bottom kind of retract). </p>
<p>As you circulate during the activity, refer back to this experience to help students understand the impacts that horizontal dilations have on graphs of functions. </p>
<p>Allow students to work in pairs to check each other‚Äôs graphs and discuss the relationships to answer the questions. During class discussion, solicit a pair for each question to describe the effects the applied transformations have on the graphs.</p>
<p>For students who can benefit from a more accessible model, use geoboards and rubber bands. Use one color rubber band for the \(ùë•-\) and \(ùë¶\)-axes. Use a different color for each line graphed. Work with students to count spots on the geoboard and discuss the graphs and their relationships.</p>

<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>Now that students have learned about the 4 different transformations that may be applied to functions, pose the following question: Can we sketch a graph by reversing the order of the transformations?</p>
<p>Have students work in pairs to develop their arguments and displays. Encourage students to use tables, arrows, and other annotations to support their visual explanations. </p>
<p>To differentiate the task, assign some groups to explore the question using two, three, or all four of the transformations. </p>
<p>As you circulate around the room, select which groups should present and sequence their presentation order. Be sure the groups you select help to uncover the fact that the order of the transformations follows the order of operations. So, no, the order cannot be reversed. You must perform a vertical dilation before applying a vertical shift. Similarly, a horizontal shift must be performed prior to making a vertical shift. </p>
<p>After the selected groups have finished their presentations, ask each student to write their final answer to the question.</p>
<p>Explain to students that graphing linear functions using transformations will assist them as you move to graphing different function families in the future.</p>

<h4>4.11.5: Additional Resources</h4>
<h4>Horizontal Transformations of Linear Functions</h4>
<p>Horizontal transformations are the result of altering the input values before applying the function rule. Vertical transformations result from altering the output values after the function rule has been applied.</p>
<h4>Example 1</h4>
<p>Describe how \( f(x) \) is transformed into \( f(x - 3) \).</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>First, graph the given function, \( f(x) \), the parent linear function.</p>
<br/><img alt="A thick, red dashed line with a positive slope passes through the origin on an x-y grid, extending from the lower left to the upper right. Both axes are labeled and ticked from negative 4 to 5 for x and negative 4 to 7 for y." height="400" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/61cfb03b386e5266f81b2e3ca27eea9b9ffc4262"/><br/>
<p>Now, let‚Äôs examine an input value of \(x=2\) using \(f(x)\).</p>
<ul>
<li>For the parent function \(f(x)\), all points on the line are represented by \((x, f(x))\).</li>
<li>So, when \(x = 2\), then \(f(x)\) becomes \(f(2)\).</li>
<li>That means this point is located at \((2, f(2))\) or \((2, 2)\).</li></ul>
<p>In order to get the same output value for \(f(x-3)\) as we had for \(f(x)\), we need to figure out how to change the input value. 
<ul>
<li>Because our transformed equation is subtracting three from what we input, we have to increase the prior input value by 3 units to yield the same output as \(f(x)\).</li>
<li>The input value that is 3 units larger than \(x = 2\) is 5. In the transformed equation, we must use \(x=5\).</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in the original equation where \(x = 2\) resulted in \(f(2) = 2\), in the transformed equation, we have to use \(x = 5\) in order for \(f(x-3) = f(5-3) = f(2)\).</p>
<br/><img alt="A graph shows two lines: a red dashed line with open circles at (2,2), and a blue solid line passing through the points (2, negative 1) and (5,2) with an open circle." height="400" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/8f9d902064d1fc2e5f2f3ae3446228943b50a051"/><br/>
<p>On the graph, \(x = 5\) is located 3 units to the right of \(x = 2\). So, the transformed equation of \(f(x-3)\) is 3 units to the right of \(f(x)\).</p>
<p>Horizontal transformations are represented by the rule \(f(x - c)\) where \(c\) indicates the number of units to the right or left that the graph is shifted.</p>
<h4>Example 2</h4>
<p>Graph \( f(x + 2) \) when \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x - 3 \). Then, determine the equation of the transformed function.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1 - </strong>Graph the given function, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x - 3 \).</p>
<p>
    The \(y\)-intercept is (0, -3) and the slope is \(\frac{1}{2}\).
    <br/>
    For horizontal shifts, it is helpful to identify the \(x\)-intercept. On our graph, the \(x\)-intercept or zero is located at (6,0). 
</p>
<br/><p><img alt="A graph with a dashed red line with a positive slope. There is a white open circle on the line at the point (6, 0)." height="400" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/7c298488a153cf8edefee6e5013ed6689356bb41" title="RAISE 4.11.5 AR Ex0 graph"/></p><br/>
<p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Apply the designated transformation. Remember that the rule for a horizontal shift is \( f(x - c) \). If we rewrite \( f(x + 2) \) in an equivalent form, we can make it is easier to see \( x - c \).</p>
<p>\( f(x + 2) = f(x - (-2)) \) That means \( c = -2 \).</p>
<p>So, \( f(x + 2) \) represents a horizontal shift of two units to the left. On our graph, we move the \(x\)-intercept two units left from (6, 0) to (4, 0).</p>
<br/><p><img alt="A graph with a solid blue line and a dashed red line are parallel on a grid. The blue line passes through points (4, 0), and (6,0), which are marked with open circles. Axes range from -2 to 8 on x and -5 to 6 on y." height="400" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/7001e55a2d1f2cc14391c9d6c025175e4db07cb5"/></p><br/>
<p>The orange dashed line is the graph of the original function and the blue solid line is the transformed function.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 - </strong>Determine the equation of the transformed function.</p>
<p>The \(y\)-intercept of the transformed line is (0, -2) and the slope of the line is \(\frac{2}{4}\) or \(\frac{1}{2}\).</p>
<p>That means the equation \( f(x + 2) = \frac{1}{2}x - 2 \)</p>
<p>Want to check your work? We can check our equation algebraically by substituting \( x + 2 \) into \( f(x) \).</p>
<p>\( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x - 3 \)</p>
<p>\( f(x+2) = \frac{1}{2}(x + 2) - 3 = \frac{1}{2}x + 1 - 3 = \frac{1}{2}x - 2 \) ‚úî</p>
<h4>Example 3</h4>
<p>Graph \( f(4x) \) when \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x - 3 \). Then, determine the equation of the transformed function.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 - </strong> Graph the given function, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x - 3 \).</p>
<p>The \(y\)-intercept is (0, -3) and the slope is \(\frac{1}{2}\).</p>
<p>For horizontal shifts, it is helpful to identify the \(x\)-intercept. On our graph, the \(x\)-intercept or zero is located at (6,0).</p>
<br/>
<p><img alt="A graph with a dashed red line with a positive slope. There is a white open circle on the line at the point (6, 0)." height="400" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/7c298488a153cf8edefee6e5013ed6689356bb41"/></p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Apply the designated transformation. Remember that the rule for a horizontal shift is \( f(bx) \). And, when the value of \( b \) is greater than 1, the function experiences a horizontal compression.</p>
<p>As a result of the horizontal compression, the linear function should look steeper because it is being compressed by a scale factor of 4.</p>
<p>On our graph, this means the \(x\)-intercept is compressed from (6, 0) to (1.5, 0).</p><br/>
<p><img alt="A graph showing a blue line with positive slope crossing the y-axis at -3, and a red dashed line with positive slope crossing the y-axis at negative 3. The lines intersect at point (0, negative 3) with an open white circle.

<p>The orange dashed line is the graph of the original function and the blue solid line is the transformed function.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 - </strong>Determine the equation of the transformed function.</p>
<p>The \(y\)-intercept of the transformed line is (0, -3) and the slope of the line is 3/1.5 or 2.</p>
<p>That means the equation \( f(4x) = 2x - 3 \).</p>
<p>Want to check your work? We can check our equation algebraically by substituting 4x into \( f(x) \).</p>
<p>\( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x - 3 \)</p>
<p>\( f(4x) = \frac{1}{2}(4x) - 3 = 2x - 3 \) ‚úî</p>
<h4>Try It: Horizontal Transformations of Linear Functions</h4>
<p>Name the transformation to go from the parent function, \( f(x) = x \), to \( f(x - 1) \).</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the solution button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Here is how to determine the transformation:</p>
<p>Because \( f(x - c) \) defines a horizontal shift, the transformation \( f(x - 1) \) moves the parent function 1 unit to the right.</p>
