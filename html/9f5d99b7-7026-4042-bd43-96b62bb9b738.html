<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm up revisits the idea that the vertex of a quadratic can be found from vertex form. Students begin by changing a quadratic function from standard to vertex form using completing the square. They will then identify the vertex. To confirm their work, they will then graph the function in both standard and vertex form using graphing technology to identify the vertex as a maximum or minimum value. This helps connect skills from unit 7 to unit 9.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Allow students to answer question 1 on their own, then check their steps for completing the square with their partner before moving on to question 2.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Write the quadratic function \(f(x)=x^2+6x+13\) in vertex form. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(f(x)=(x+3)^2+4\)</p>
<p>\((\frac{b}{2})^2=(\frac{6}{2})^2=\frac{36}{4}=9\)<br>
\(f(x)=x^2+6x+9+13-9\)<br>
\(f(x)=x^2+6x+9+4\)<br>
\(f(x)=(x+3)^2+4\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li> Using the vertex form of the quadratic found in question 1, what is the vertex? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \((-3, 4)\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li> Graph both equations from question 1 (in standard form and vertex form). (Students have access to Desmos). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>[INSERT IMAGE HERE]</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li> Determine if the vertex for the quadratic function is a maximum or minimum. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> minimum</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li> What is the axis of symmetry? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(x = -3\)</p>
<br>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Ask students to describe what completing the square does in their own words. For example, it creates a perfect square.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Some students may think the vertex is \((3, 4)\). Remind them that that formula is \(f(x)=(x-h)^2+k\) where \((h, k)\) is the vertex. </li>
</ul>
<p>This is also a great place to revisit parent functions.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Ask students to determine what the parent function is, \(f(x)=x^2\), and the transformations needed to get to the function for questions 1–5. Facilitate the connection to the vertex and the transformation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, ask students to define the axis of symmetry in their own words.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Ask: What are some ways knowing the axis of symmetry can help you? One possible answer—if they know the axis of symmetry and a point on the quadratic, they know there will be another point equidistant from the axis of symmetry on the other side of the quadratic. </li>
</ul>
