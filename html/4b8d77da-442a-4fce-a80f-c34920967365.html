<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>The function \(f\) is given by \(f(x)=10x+3\), and the function \(g\) is given by \(g(x)=2^x\). For each question, show your reasoning.</p>
<ol>
  <li> Which function reaches 50 first? <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(f(5)=53\) and \(g(5)=32\), so \(f\) reaches 50 first. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> Which function reaches 100 first? <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Answer</strong><strong>:</strong>

    \(f(7)=73\) and \(g(7)=128\), so \(g\) reaches 100 first.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5>Points to emphasize</h5>
<p>Take a few minutes in the next lesson to discuss a few approaches to estimate values to compare the two functions.</p>
