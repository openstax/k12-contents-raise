<p>Prior to this unit, students have studied quadratic functions. They analyzed and represented quadratic functions using expressions, tables, graphs, and descriptions. Students also evaluated the functions and interpreted the input and the output values in context. They encountered the terms &ldquo;standard form,&rdquo; &ldquo;factored form,&rdquo; and &ldquo;vertex form&rdquo; and examined the advantages of each form. They also rewrote expressions from factored form and vertex form to standard form.</p>
<p>In this unit, students interpret, write, and solve quadratic equations. They see that writing and solving quadratic equations enables them to find input values that produce certain output values. Suppose the revenue of a theater is a function of the ticket price for a performance. At what ticket price would the theater earn $10,000? Previously, students were only able to solve such problems by observing graphs and estimating or by guessing and checking. Here, they learn to answer such questions algebraically.</p>
<p>Students begin solving quadratic equations by reasoning. For instance, to solve \(x^2 + 9 = 25\), they think: Adding 9 to a squared number makes 25. That squared number must be 16, so \(x\) must be 4 or &minus;4. Along the way, students see that quadratic equations can have 2, 1, or 0 solutions.</p>
<p>Next, students learn that equations of the form \((x &minus; m)(x &minus; n) =0\) can be easily solved by applying the zero product property, which says that when two factors have a product of 0, one of the factors must be 0. When the equations are not in factored form, students rearrange them so that one side is 0, and they rewrite the expressions from standard form to factored form.</p>
<p>Finally, students write quadratic equations given real solutions and solve problems using technology to find the quadratic regression model.</p>
