<h4>Finding Relationships between Quantities</h4>
<p>There are times when the relationship between quantities may not be obvious. In some cases, the relationship between
  quantities might take a bit of work to figure out, by doing calculations several times or by looking for a
  pattern.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are two examples.<br></p>
<p>1. A plane departed from New Orleans and is heading to San Diego. The table shows its distance from New Orleans, \( x
  \), and its distance from San Diego, \( y \), at some points along the way.</p>
<table class="os-raise-midsizetable">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">miles from New Orleans</th>
      <th scope="col">miles from San Diego</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>100</td>
      <td>1,500</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>300</td>
      <td>1,300</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>500</td>
      <td>1,100</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><br></td>
      <td>1,020</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>900<br></td>
      <td>700</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1,450</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\( x \)</td>
      <td>\( y \)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<p><br>What is the relationship between the two distances? Do you see any patterns in how each quantity is changing? Can
  you find out what the missing values are?<br></p>
<p>Notice that every time the distance from New Orleans increases by some number of miles, the distance from San Diego
  decreases by the same number of miles, and that the sum of the two values is always 1,600 miles.</p>
<p>The relationship can be expressed with any of these equations:</p>
<p>\( x+y=1,600 \)<br>\(y=1,600-x\)<br>\(x=1,600-y \)</p>
<p>2. A company decides to donate $50,000 to charity. It will select up to 20 charitable organizations, as nominated by
  its employees. Each selected organization will receive an equal donation amount.</p>
<p>What is the relationship between the number of selected organizations, \(n\), and the dollar amount each of them will
  receive, \( d \)?</p>
<ul>
  <li>If 5 organizations are selected, each one receives $10,000.</li>
  <li>If 10 organizations are selected, each one receives $5,000.</li>
  <li>If 20 organizations are selected, each one receives $2,500.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you notice a pattern here?&nbsp;10,000 is \( \frac{50,000}{5} \), 5,000 is \( \frac{50,000}{10} \), and 2,500 is
  \( \frac{50,000}{20} \).</p>
<p>We can generalize that the amount each organization receives is 50,000 divided by the number of selected
  organizations, or&nbsp;\( d=\frac{50,000}{n} \).</p>
<h4>Try It: Finding Relationships between Quantities</h4>
<p>A local business is going to hand out $20,000 in scholarships to students at local high schools.</p>
<p>What is the relationship between the number of students, \( s \), and the dollar amount each student will receive, \(
  d \)?</p>
<ul>
  <li>If there are 2 students selected, each student will receive $10,000.</li>
  <li>If there are 5 students selected, each student will receive $4,000.</li>
  <li>If there are 10 students selected, each student will receive $2,000</li>
  <li>If there are 20 students selected, each student will receive $1,000.</li>
</ul>

  <p>Here is how to write a model for the relationship between the number of students receiving scholarships and the
    dollar amount they receive.</p>
  <p>There is a pattern:</p>
  <p>10,000 is \( \frac{20,000}{2} \)<br>4,000 is \( \frac{20,000}{5} \)<br>2,000 is \( \frac{20,000}{10} \)<br>1,000 is
    \( \frac{20,000}{20} \)</p>
  <p>The amount each student receives is $20,000 divided by the number of students or, \(d=\frac{20000}{s}\). The dollar
    amount each student receives, \( d \), varies inversely as the number of students, \( s \).</p>
