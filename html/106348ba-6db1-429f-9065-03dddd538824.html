<p>The phrases &ldquo;correlation, not causation&rdquo; or &ldquo;association, not causation&rdquo; are often used to refer to situations in which there is a relationship, but it is not a causal relationship. While <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">correlation</span> used to describe the strength of the relationship between variables, a <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">causal relationship</span> means that a change in one of the variables actually causes a change in the other variable.</p>
<p>Describe a pair of variables with each condition. Be prepared to show your reasoning.</p>

    <p>Amount of power produced by solar panels and the percentage of people wearing sunglasses while driving. These factors are probably strongly, positively related, but the cause is the amount of sunlight getting through to the ground for each variable rather than either one of the variables causing the other to increase directly.</p>

        Claim 1: There appears to be
        evidence for correlation because there was a control group, and the blood
        pressure was taken before and after drinking tea. However, there was no
        mention of how the groups were randomized or selected, so I am not sure
        if there is evidence for causation.

        Claim 2: The only evidence

        need to be done on antioxidants and health to show correlation or
        causation.

        Claim 3: There is no evidence for correlation or causation

    <p>To show that heartburn relief is correlated with or caused by drinking soda, I would have to randomly assign subjects to different treatment groups. One group would get soda, and the other would get a placebo. I would then need to collect and compare data about their heartburn symptoms to determine if there is correlation or causation.</p>
