<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>The phrases &ldquo;correlation, not causation&rdquo; or &ldquo;association, not causation&rdquo; are often used to refer to situations in which there is a relationship, but it is not a causal relationship. While <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">correlation</span> used to describe the strength of the relationship between variables, a <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">causal relationship</span> means that a change in one of the variables actually causes a change in the other variable.</p>
<p>Describe a pair of variables with each condition. Be prepared to show your reasoning.</p>

<p>Amount of power produced by solar panels and the percentage of people wearing sunglasses while driving. These factors are probably strongly, positively related, but the cause is the amount of sunlight getting through to the ground for each variable rather than either one of the variables causing the other to increase directly.</p>

<h4>Making a Real-World Connection</h4>
<p>1. Look through news articles or
      advertisements for claims of causation or correlation. Find 2 or 3 claims
      and read or watch the articles or the advertisements. Answer these
      questions for each of the claims.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
<li>
<p>What is the claim?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What evidence is provided for the claim?</p>

<li>
<p>Does there appear to be evidence for causation or correlation? Explain your thinking.</p>

<p>Claim 1: Green tea lowers blood pressure. Claim 2: Chocolate improves health. Claim 3: Soda helps with heartburn.</p>

<p>Claim 1: Study groups were
          given either green tea or a drink that was colored like green tea for
          several weeks, and their blood pressure was taken before and after the
          study. Claim 2: They analyzed the number of antioxidants in chocolate as
          compared to fruit. Claim 3: No evidence was provided other than that it
          seemed to work for some people.</p>

<li>
<p>Claim 1: There appears to be
          evidence for correlation because there was a control group, and the blood
          pressure was taken before and after drinking tea. However, there was no
          mention of how the groups were randomized or selected, so I am not sure
          if there is evidence for causation. Claim 2: The only evidence
          provided is the quantity of antioxidants chocolate contains, so a study would
          need to be done on antioxidants and health to show correlation or
          causation. Claim 3: There is no evidence for correlation or causation
          because only a testimonial is provided.</p>

<p>To show that heartburn relief is correlated with or caused by drinking soda, I would have to randomly assign subjects to different treatment groups. One group would get soda, and the other would get a placebo. I would then need to collect and compare data about their heartburn symptoms to determine if there is correlation or causation.</p>
