<p>Nafy&rsquo;s company makes healthy drinks and snack mixes. To make sure the snacks are nutritious, she can use constraints to represent the upper and lower limits of weight, cost, and nutritional values of the ingredients. She can represent those constraints using inequalities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this section, you will revisit the meaning of the solutions to an inequality in one variable and recall that the solution set is a range of values. You will write and solve inequalities to answer questions about a situation. You will investigate different ways to find the solution set to an inequality by</p>
<ul>
  <li>reasoning about the quantities and relationships in context;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>guessing some values, substituting them into the inequality, and checking them to see if they make an inequality true;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>first solving a related equation and testing values greater than and less than the solution; and</li>
  <li>using properties of inequality.</li>
</ul>
<p>This section includes 3 lessons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Representing Situations with Inequalities</li>
  <li>Solutions to Inequalities in One Variable</li>
  <li>Writing and Solving Inequalities in One Variable</li>
