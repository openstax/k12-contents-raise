<p>Ozzy Gamez and Juan Quezada were motivated by their mutual love of plants to open a business, Plant Shop Chicago. They had a vision that it would be a place where people could come and enjoy nature and perhaps find a plant that matches their personality. An important part of owning a business is understanding how much you are spending and how much you are making. Polynomials can be used to represent cost and revenue. Profit is revenue minus costs, so understanding operations with polynomials can help Ozzy and Juan make decisions to help their operation run smoothly.</p>
<p>In this section, you will classify polynomials based on the number of terms and the degree of exponents. You will add and subtract polynomials by combining like terms. In the second lesson, you will use the properties of exponents and the Distributive Property to multiply polynomials. The last lesson of the section continues your exploration of operations with polynomials by introducing division by monomials using the Quotient Property. You will divide a polynomial by another polynomial using long division as you have previously learned using numbers.</p>
