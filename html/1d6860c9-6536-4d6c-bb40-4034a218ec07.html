<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>In earlier lessons, students saw that the quadratic formula can be used to solve any quadratic equation, but also that it might not be the most practical approach for all equations. Here, students deepen their understanding about the merits and potential drawbacks of using the quadratic formula. They pay close attention to each step in the solving process and analyze errors commonly made when applying the formula. Students also consider how to verify that the solutions they obtained with the quadratic formula are correct.</p>
<p>In analyzing the solution process and checking their work and the work of others, students practice attending to precision and critiquing the reasoning of others.</p>
<p>Technology isn't required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems. Consider making technology available.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Analyze and critique (orally and in writing) solutions to quadratic equations that are found using the quadratic formula. </li>
  <li> Determine whether a given value is a solution to a quadratic equation. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Identify common errors when using the quadratic formula. </li>
  <li> Describe some ways to tell if a number is a solution to a quadratic equation. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners
</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment 
  </li>
  <li>A2(I) demonstrate listening comprehension of increasingly complex spoken English by following directions, retelling or summarizing spoken messages, responding to questions and requests, collaborating with peers, and taking notes commensurate with content and grade-level needs
  </li>
  <li>A3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions 
  </li>
  <li>A3(G) express opinions, ideas, and feelings ranging from communicating single words and short phrases to participating in extended discussions on a variety of social and grade-appropriate academic topics
