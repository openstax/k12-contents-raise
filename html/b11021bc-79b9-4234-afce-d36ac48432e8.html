<h2>Activity (15 minutes)</h2>
<div class="body">
  <p>In this activity, students examine simple relationships that can each be expressed with many equations. Writing multiple equations for the same relationship and doing so in context prepares students to later consider more rigorously what makes equations equivalent.</p>
  <p>As students write equations for the first relationship, identify students who use all numbers and those who use both numbers and variables.</p>
  <p>For the second question, students may explain Tyler&rsquo;s claim concretely (using values of <span class="math math-repaired">\( m \)</span> and <span class="math math-repaired">\( y \)</span>) or more abstractly (using the structure of the equations). For instance, they may reason that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When the middle child is 12, the youngest child is 7, and substituting <span class="math math-repaired">\( m=12 \)</span> and <span class="math math-repaired">\( y=7 \)</span> to <span class="math math-repaired">\( 2m-2y \)</span> gives <span class="math math-repaired">\( 2(12) - 2(7) \)</span> or <span class="math math-repaired">\( 24 - 14 \)</span>, which is 10. At all other ages of the two children, the expression <span class="math math-repaired">\( 2m-2y \)</span> always has a value of 10.</li>
    <li>
      <span class="math math-repaired">\( 2m-2y=10 \)</span> is twice&nbsp;<span class="math math-repaired">\( m-y=5 \)</span>. If the difference between <span class="math math-repaired">\( m \)</span> and <span class="math math-repaired">\( y \)</span> is 5, then twice the difference between <span class="math math-repaired">\( m \)</span> and <span class="math math-repaired">\( y \)</span> must be twice 5, which is 10, so the two equations are still describing the same relationship.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Identify students who reason in these ways so they can share later.</p>
</div>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<div class="body">
  <p>Give students a couple of minutes to answer the first question and ask them to pause for a discussion before moving on.</p>
  <p>Invite students to share their equations. Record and display the equations for all to see. Along the way, consider organizing them into categories (numerical equations, equations in one variable, and equations in two variables).</p>
  <p>Solicit from students some thoughts on the following questions. (It is not necessary to resolve the questions at the moment.)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&ldquo;Consider the equations you wrote for each situation. Are they all equivalent? Why or why not?&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&ldquo;What do you think it means for two equations to be equivalent?&rdquo;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some students might say that each equation accurately represents the same relationship between the ages, so the equations must be equivalent. Those who wrote variable equations might say that the equations are equivalent because the same value for the variable makes each equation true. </p>
  <p>After students have had a chance to consider these questions, prompt them to complete the remaining questions.</p>

      <h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>

        <p>Some students may say that <span class="math math-repaired">\( 2m-2y=10 \)</span> doesn&rsquo;t describe the relationship between the ages because it doesn&rsquo;t involve the number 5. Encourage students to think of some values for <span class="math math-repaired">\( m \)</span> and <span class="math math-repaired">\( y \)</span> that <em>do</em> make the equation true. After they find some pairs of <span class="math math-repaired">\( m \)</span> and <span class="math math-repaired">\( y \)</span>, ask them what they notice about the pairs.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
      <div class="body">
        <p>Select previously identified students to share their explanation of why Tyler&rsquo;s claim is true, in the order shown in the Activity Narrative. If no students mention the last approach, bring it up.</p>
        <p>Next, emphasize two main points:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span><span>Equivalent equations</span> </span>have identical solutions, or identical values that make each of the equations true. All of the equations in the last question are equivalent because they have 3 as the solution and they all have no other solutions.
          </li>
          <li>Suppose we start with a true equation, where the two sides are equal. If we perform the same operation to both sides of the equation and get a new equation where the two sides are also equal, we can say that the two equations are equivalent. For instance:
            <ul>
              <li>Subtracting 6 from both sides of <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3a + 6 = 15 \)</span>&nbsp;gives <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3a=9 \)</span>. If <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3a+6 \)</span> and 15 are equal, then the expressions or numbers we get by subtracting 6 from each one are also equal. We can conclude that <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3a+6=15 \)</span> and <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3a=9 \)</span> are equivalent.</li>
              <li>Dividing both sides of <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3a + 6 = 15 \)</span> by 3 gives <span class="math math-repaired">\( a + 2 = 5 \)</span>. If <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3a+6 \)</span> is equal to 15, the result of dividing <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3a+6 \)</span> by 3 is equal to dividing 15 by 3. We can conclude that <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3a+6=15 \)</span> and <span class="math math-repaired">\( a + 2 = 5 \)</span> are equivalent.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ask students:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>&ldquo;How can we show that <span class="math math-repaired">\( \frac13a = 1 \)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3a = 9 \)</span>?&rdquo; (Multiplying both sides of <span class="math math-repaired">\( \frac13a = 1 \)</span> by 9 gives <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3a=9 \)</span>.)</li>
          <li>&ldquo;How can we show that <span class="math math-repaired">\( a + 2 = 5 \)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math math-repaired">\( \frac13a = 1 \)</span>?&rdquo; (Subtracting 2 from both sides of <span class="math math-repaired">\( a + 2 = 5 \)</span> and then multiplying both sides of the resulting equation, <span class="math math-repaired">\( a=3 \)</span>, by <span class="math math-repaired">\( \frac13 \)</span> gives <span class="math math-repaired">\( \frac13a = 1 \)</span>.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If no students notice that we have made these moves when solving equations, bring it to their attention. Highlight that solving an equation essentially involves writing a series of equivalent equations that eventually isolates the variable on one side.</p>
