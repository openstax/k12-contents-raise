<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>At the beginning of this unit, students compared linear and exponential growth. They return to this comparison in this lesson. This warm-up aims to show that, visually, it could be very difficult to distinguish linear and exponential growth for some domain of the function. While any exponential function eventually grows very quickly, it also can look remarkably linear over a portion of the domain.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here is a graph.</p>
<p><img alt="Graph of line, origin O. Horizontal axis 0 to 7, by 1&rsquo;s, labeled x. Vertical from 0 to 150, by 50&rsquo;s, labeled y. Starts at 0 comma 120, appears to pass through 1 point 5 comma 125 and 7 comma 150.  &nbsp;" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/bad0b52014f58b56c36d99212daa7f56596f8dba"></p>
<ol>
<li> Which equation do you think the graph represents? Use the graph to support your reasoning. </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li> \(y=120+(3.7) \cdot x\) </li>
<li> \(y=120 \cdot (1.03)^x\) </li>
<br>
<strong>Answer: </strong>All answers are acceptable if backed up by a reasonable explanation. Sample responses:
  <ul>
<li>The graph is for \(y=120+3.7x\) because it appears linear. On the graph, when \(x=7\), the value of \(y\) appears to be a little less than 150. When \(x=7\), \(120+(3.7) \cdot 7=145.9\), so the slope of the line could be 3.7.</li>
<li>The graph is for \(y=120 \cdot (1.03)^x\). Multiplying 100 by 1.03 seven times, or \(100 \cdot (1.03)^7\), gives approximately 147.6, which more or less concurs with what is on the graph.</li>
<li>It is hard to tell. I tried finding the \(y\)-coordinate values for different values of \(x\) using both equations, and they more or less agree with what is on the graph.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>What information might help you decide more easily whether the graph represents a linear or an exponential function? <br>
<br>
<strong>Answer: </strong> Sample responses:
  </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Exact coordinates of points on the graph with whole-number \(x\)-values </li>
<li>A larger graphing window showing larger domain values so that the behavior of the function can be more visible </li>
</ul>
<h4> Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share the rationales for their decision and their ideas for improving the clarity of the graph.</p>
<p>Help students understand that the graph of a linear function always looks like a line, regardless of the domain where it is plotted. An exponential function, however, can look linear depending on the domain and range. Graphs are very helpful for seeing the general behavior of a function but not always for determining what kind of function is being graphed.</p>
<p>Consider showing students this image of the graph showing a larger domain and range as well as the original window (the red rectangle in the lower left).</p>

<p>Or show a dynamic graph of \(y=120 \cdot (1.03)^x\), starting with a small window where the graph looks linear and then zooming out until the curve is visible</p>
