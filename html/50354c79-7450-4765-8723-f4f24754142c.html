<div class="synthesis">
<p>Now that students have an additional strategy for solving systems in their toolkit, invite students to reflect on three systems seen in the synthesis of a previous lesson, in which they made a case for solving one by substitution.</p>

<div class="g--col-2 g--column g--content g--one-third g--row-1">
<p>System 2</p>
<p><span class="math math-repaired">\( \begin {cases} 4x + y = 1\\y = -2x+9 \end {cases} \)</span></p>
</div>
<div class="g--col-3 g--column g--content g--one-third g--row-1">
<p>System 3</p>
<p><span class="math">\( \displaystyle \begin{cases} 5x+4y=15 \\ 5x+11y=22 \end{cases} \)</span></p>

<p>Ask students to discuss the following questions with a partner and be prepared to report their partner&rsquo;s responses:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Look at a system that you would have chosen to solve by substitution. Would you still choose to solve it by substitution now? Why or why not?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Look at a system that you would <em>not</em> have chosen to solve by substitution. Would it help to solve by elimination? Why or why not?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>With a little bit of rearranging (of the equations), all of these systems could be solved by substitution or elimination. Students should at least recognize that systems 1 and 3 can be solved efficiently by elimination, while system 2 can be solved efficiently by substitution.</p>
