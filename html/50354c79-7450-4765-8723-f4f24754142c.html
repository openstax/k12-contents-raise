<p>Now that students have an additional strategy for solving systems in their toolkit, invite students to reflect on three systems seen in the synthesis of a previous lesson, in which they made a case for solving one by substitution.</p>
<p>System 1</p>
<p>\( \begin {cases} 3m + n = 71\\2m-n =30 \end {cases} \)</p>
<p>System 2</p>
<p>\( \begin {cases} 4x + y = 1\\y = -2x+9 \end {cases} \)</p>
<p>System 3</p>
<p>\( \displaystyle \begin{cases} 5x+4y=15 \\ 5x+11y=22 \end{cases} \)</p>
<p>Ask students to discuss the following questions with a partner and be prepared to report their partner&rsquo;s responses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Look at a system that you would have chosen to solve by substitution. Would you still choose to solve it by substitution now? Why or why not?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Look at a system that you would <em>not</em> have chosen to solve by substitution. Would it help to solve by elimination? Why or why not?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>With a little bit of rearranging (of the equations), all of these systems could be solved by substitution or elimination. Students should at least recognize that systems 1 and 3 can be solved efficiently by elimination, while system 2 can be solved efficiently by substitution.</p>

<h3>Closing the Lesson</h3>
<p>After completing the Lesson Synthesis, wrap up the class by directing students to the Lesson Summary in their student textbook. In this section, students review the dayâ€™s learning targets, read summaries about the key takeaways from each activity, and then respond to a reflection question regarding their confidence with the material. </p>

<p>For more on the benefits of using this type of metacognitive reflection, see the Research in Practice section of the course. </p>
