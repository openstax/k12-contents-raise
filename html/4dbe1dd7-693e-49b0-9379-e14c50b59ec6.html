<p>For questions 1 - 2 , use the following prompt and image.</p>
<blockquote> The image shows the battery usage of a cell phone 9 hours after it was fully charged. It also shows a prediction that the battery would last 8 more hours.</blockquote>
<p><img alt="A smartphone screen displays Advanced battery usage. The battery level is at 52% with a descending graph, and the data is from 9 hours ago. The screen has a blue border and icons at the top." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/878a59b47b031b568820dd2669e635e32855b6a1" width="300"/></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li> Write an equation for a model that fits the data in the image and gives the percent of battery power as a function of time since the phone was fully charged. Be prepared to show your reasoning.
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<li> Based on your function, what percentage of power would the battery have 4 hours after this image was taken? What about 5 hours after the image was taken? Be prepared to show your reasoning. </li>
</ol>
<p>For questions 3 - 5, use the following prompt and images.</p>
<blockquote>Here are two more images showing the battery usage at two later times, before the battery was charged again. </blockquote>
<p><img alt="Side-by-side smartphone screens show battery usage graphs: left screen at 29% with 4 hours left, right screen at 7% with 29 minutes left. Both display descending battery percentage over time." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/e759b18e61a284924951bc44fec6d6c6471b4fe9" width="550"/></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
<li> How well did the function you wrote predict the battery power 4 and 5 hours after the first image was taken (that is, 13 and 14 hours after the battery was fully charged)? Be prepared to show your reasoning. </li> <br/>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
<li> What do you notice about the change in the prediction between \( t=13 \) and \( t=14 \)?</li> <br/>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
<li> Write a new equation for a function that would better fit the data shown in the last image. </li>
</ol>
