<h3>Activity: P4.3: Write an Equation to Model Data</h3>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" >
  <li> The image shows the battery usage of a cell phone 9 hours after it was fully charged. </li>
</ol>
<p>It also shows a prediction that the battery would last 8 more hours.</p>

<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="2" >
  <li> Write an equation for a model that fits the data in the image and gives the percent of battery power as a function of time since the phone was fully charged. Be prepared to show your reasoning.
    If you get stuck, consider creating a table of values or a scatter plot of the data. </li>
</ol>
<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li> Based on your function, what percentage of power would the battery have 4 hours after this image was taken? What about 5 hours after the image was taken? Be prepared to show your reasoning. </li>
</ol>
<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li> Here are two more images showing the battery usage at two later times, before the battery was charged again. </li>
</ol>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="5" >
  <li> How well did the function you wrote predict the battery power 4 and 5 hours after the first image was taken (that is, 13 and 14 hours after the battery was fully charged)? Be prepared to show your reasoning. </li>
