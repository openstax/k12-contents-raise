<h4>Recognize the Relation Between the Solutions of an Inequality and its Graph</h4>
<p>Now, we will look at how the solutions of an inequality relate to its graph. Let’s think about the number line shown previously again. The point \(x = 3\) separated that number line into two parts. On one side of 3 are all the numbers less than 3. On the other side of 3 all the numbers are greater than 3. See the figure below.
</p>
<img alt="A number line from negative 5 to 5 with arrows above it. On the number line, there is an open parenthesis at 3 with the numbers to the right of 3 shaded. Above the number line is a set of arrows. One arrow points left from 3 and is labeled numbers less than 3. The other arrow above the number line points right from 3 and is labeled numbers greater than 3." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="72" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/5d0288de5ccd152c0943577dea1e3e7902515d40" width="450"/><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>The solution of \( x&gt;3 \) is the shaded part of the number line to the right of \( x = 3 \)</p>
<p>Similarly, the line \(y = x + 4\) separates the plane into two regions. On one side of the line are points with \( y &lt; x + 4\) . On the other side of the line are the points with \( y &gt; x + 4 \). We call the line \( y = x + 4 \) a <strong>boundary line. </strong></p>

          The line with equation \( Ax + By = C \) is the boundary line that separates the region where \( Ax + By &gt; C \) from the region where \( Ax + By &lt; C \). </p>
</div>
<br/>
<p>For an inequality in one variable, the endpoint is shown with a parenthesis or a bracket depending on whether or not \( a \) is included in the solution: </p>

<br/>
<p>Similarly, for an inequality in two variables, the boundary line is shown with a solid or dashed line to show whether or not it the line is included in the solution. </p>

<p>Now, let’s take a look at what we found in the example above. We’ll start by graphing the line \( y = x + 4 \), and then we’ll plot the five points we tested, as shown in the graph. See the figure below.
</p>
<img alt="The graph of y equals x plus four on a coordinate plane. Five additional points are plotted on the plane at (0, 0), (1, 6), (2, 6), (negative 5, negative 15), and (negative 8, 12)." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="606" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/e779e442c4198dc4bd5d2014d08e1bff3b30c48d" width="400"/><br/>
<br/>
<p>In the previous example, we found that some of the points were solutions to the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \) and some were not.
</p>
<p>Which of the points we plotted are solutions to the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \)? </p>
<p>The points \( (1, 6) \) and \( (-8, 12) \) are solutions to the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \). Notice that they are both on the same side of the boundary line \( y &gt; x + 4 \). </p>
<p>The two points \( (0, 0) \) and \( (-5, -15) \) are on the other side of the boundary line \( y = x + 4 \), and they are not solutions to the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \). For those two points. \( y &lt; x + 4 \). </p>
<p>What about the point \((2,6)\)? The point \((2,6)\) is a solution to the boundary line equation \(y=x+4\), because \(6=2+4\).  However, \((2,6)\) is not a solution to the inequality, because the boundary line is not included in the solution to the inequality \(y &gt; x+4\).</p>
<p>Let's take another point above the boundary line and test whether or not it is a solution to the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \). The point \( (0, 10) \) clearly looks to above the boundary line, doesn't it? Is it a solution to the inequality? </p>
<p>\( y &gt; x + 4 \)<br/>
  \( 10 &gt; 0 + 4 \)<br/>
  \( 10 &gt; 4 \)</p>
<p>So, \( (0, 10) \) is a solution to \( y &gt; x + 4 \). </p>
<p>Any point you choose above the boundary line is a solution to the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \). All points above the boundary line are solutions. </p>
<p>Similarly, all points below the boundary line, the side with \( (0, 0) \) and \( (−5, −15) \), are not solutions to \( y &gt; x + 4 \), as shown in the figure below.
</p>

The half plane above the line and to the left is labeled as y greater than x plus 4. The region below the line and to the right is labeled as y less than x plus 4." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="606" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/2b394e6ec6217d6bafaf36078cbf643155b0c85b" width="400"/><br/>
<br/>
<p>The graph of the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \) is shown in below. </p>
<p>The line \( y = x + 4 \) divides the plane into two regions. The shaded side shows the solutions to the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \). </p>
<p>The points on the boundary line, those where\( y = x + 4 \), are not solutions to the inequality \( y &gt; x + 4 \), so the line itself is not part of the solution. We show that by making the line dashed, not solid. </p>
