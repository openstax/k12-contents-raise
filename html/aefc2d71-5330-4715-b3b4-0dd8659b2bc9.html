<h4>Classifying and Rewriting Systems of Equations</h4>
<p>Find a solution to the system of equations using the&nbsp;addition method.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<div>
<p>With the addition method, we want to eliminate one of the variables by adding the equations. In this case, let&rsquo;s focus on eliminating x. If we multiply both sides of the first equation by&nbsp;&minus;3 then we will be able to eliminate the&nbsp;x-variable.</p>
<p id="fs-id1165135612011">\(x+3y=2\)<br>\((-3)(x+3y)=(-3)(2)\)<br>\(-3x-9y=-6\)</p>
<p>Now add the equations.</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{r}-3x-9y=-6\\+3x+9y=6\\\hline0=0\end{array}\)</p>
<p id="fs-id1165133188516">We can see that there will be an infinite number of solutions that satisfy both equations.</p>

<p><span lang="EN">\(x = 5 - 3y\)</span></p>
<p><span>Substitute

<p><span lang="EN">\(15&nbsp;&ne; 6\)</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Since
