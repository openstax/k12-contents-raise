<p>In this lesson, you will learn that equivalent equations are equations with identical solutions. Specifically, you will explore how applying properties of real numbers can create equivalent equations. Additionally, you will use context to interpret the solution to equivalent equations.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Tell whether two expressions are equivalent and explain why or why not.</li>
  <li>Identify the moves that can be made to transform an equation into an equivalent one.</li>
  <li>Explain what it means for two equations to be equivalent and how equivalent equations can be used to describe the same situation in different ways.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
