<img alt='Illustration of a vibrant pumpkin patch with scattered pumpkins, a wheelbarrow, and a "Pumpkin" sign. In the background, barns and a windmill stand under cloudy skies.' src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/7536812b8dcff5334ed90bc5fda8a2a19521a7a2" width="200px"/>
<p>Anna's class entered a contest where they had to build a catapault and use it to launch a pumpkin at a distant target. But when Anna's class shot their pumpkin for the first time, it went wildly off course.</p>
<p>Anna thought about their problem and came up with a solution. If Anna's class used a quadratic equation, they could mathematically find the best place and angle for their pumpkin catapault. It worked! Their accuracy went from 2% to 99%. </p>
<p>You can use quadratic equations for any object that travels in a curved path, like footballs, frisbees, and golf balls. </p>
