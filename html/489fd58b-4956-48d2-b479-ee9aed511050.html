<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students represent a situation using a table of values, a graph, and an equation. From the exponential equation, it is a short step to thinking of the relationship between the quantities as a function.</p>
<p>Note that it is possible and acceptable to think of time as a function of area, but expressing this using an equation is out of the scope of this course. Students could, however, represent such a function with a graph, table, or description.</p>
<p>Making graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically.</p>

  <p>Represent the same information through different modalities by drawing a diagram. Encourage students who are unsure where to begin to sketch a diagram of a slice of bread on graph paper and to shade the area that is covered in mold after 1 day, then 2 days . . . until they reach the day when the slice of bread is completely covered in mold.</p>
</div>
<br>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Clare noticed mold on the last slice of bread in a plastic bag. The area covered by the mold was about 1 square millimeter. She left the bread alone to see how the mold would grow. The next day, the area covered by the mold had doubled, and it doubled again the day after that.</p>
<ol>
  <li> If the doubling pattern continues, how many square millimeters will the mold cover 4 days after she noticed the mold? Show your reasoning. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>ANSWER:</strong> 16 square millimeters. \(2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2\) or \(2^4\) is 16. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> Represent the relationship between the area \(A\), in square millimeters, covered by the mold and the number of days \(d\)&nbsp;since the mold was spotted using: </li>
  <ol>
    <li> A table of values, showing the values from the day the mold was spotted through 5 days later. </li>

  <li> Discuss with your partner: Is the relationship between the area covered by mold and the number of days a function? If so, write ____ is a function of ____. If not, explain why it is not. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>ANSWER:</strong> Yes. Sample responses: <br>
    <br>
    The area covered by mold is a function of the number of days that have passed. At any given time since mold was spotted, there is a certain area of the bread that is covered in mold.<br>
    <br>
    The number of days that have passed is a function of the area covered by the mold up to a certain point (e.g., when the entire bread is already completely covered, the area of mold would correspond to more than one day). We do not have a way to write this relationship using an equation, but we could use a table or a graph to show the relationship.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Student-Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>What do you think is an appropriate domain for the mold area function \(A\)? Explain your reasoning.</p>
<h4>Extension Student Response</h4>
<p>Answers vary. For example: Some negative values of \(t\) could be relevant, but we don&rsquo;t know how the mold was growing before Clare started watching. Positive values of \(t\) will not be valid indefinitely because the bread will soon be completely covered by mold. If a piece of bread is 10 cm by 10 cm, that&rsquo;s 10,000 square mm. An appropriate domain would be \(0 \leq d \leq 14\).</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may have trouble understanding how to account for time in the first question. They may benefit from writing the area after 1 day has passed, after 2 days have passed, etc. A table is a convenient way to gather this information.</p>
<h4> Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Discuss why the area covered by mold is a function of the number of days that have passed. Attend explicitly to language students learned in the prior unit on functions: The area of the mold \(A\) is a function of the number of days \(d\) since the mold was spotted, \(A=f(d)\). The function \(f\)<em>&nbsp;</em>expressing the mold relationship can be written as \(f(d)=1 \cdot 2^d\), where \(d\)&nbsp;measures days since the mold was spotted and \(f(d)\) gives the area covered by the mold in square millimeters.</p>
<p>Discuss whether a discrete graph or a curve is more appropriate and what domain would be suitable in this context. Ask questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Can the independent variable be something like 1.5, a number that is not a whole number? Is there an area that is associated with 1.5 days?&rdquo; (Yes, some areas of the bread are covered by mold at any point in time. The mold doesn&rsquo;t disappear after being spotted and then reappear at exactly 1 full day, 2 full days, etc.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;What would be the meaning of a point on the graph where the value of \(d\) is, for instance, between 2 and 3?&rdquo; (It would mean the area covered by mold at some point longer than 2 days but less than 3 days after mold was spotted.) </li>
  <li>&ldquo;What domain would be appropriate for this function? Can the mold grow indefinitely?&rdquo; (Since the area of the bread (the range) is limited, the exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely. By the end of one week, more than 1 square cm will be covered and, by the end of the second week, the values of the function will be close to or will exceed the total area of the bread.) </li>
</ul>
<p>Students using paper and pencil may decide that it makes sense to connect the points on the graph, but they will not yet know how to do so. Consider stating that they are connected (in a very specific way), and their properties will be studied later.</p>
<p>Students using the digital version (or graphing technology along with the paper and pencil version) will see the continuous graph. If desired, you may want to demonstrate how using function notation to write the equation like \(f(d)=1 \cdot 2^d\) can be put to use. Try typing \(A(2)\) or \(A(-1)\).</p>
<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<div>
  <p>During the discussion, listen for and collect the language students use to describe the situation as a function. Call students&rsquo; attention to language such as &ldquo;independent or dependent variable&rdquo; or &ldquo;input or output value.&rdquo; Write the students&lsquo; words and phrases on a visual display and update it throughout the remainder of the lesson. Remind students to borrow language from the display as needed. This will help students use mathematical language for describing an exponential function and determining which variable is a function of the other.</p>
