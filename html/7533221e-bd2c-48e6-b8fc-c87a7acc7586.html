<h3><span>Activity (</span>20 minutes)</h3>
<p dir="ltr">In this activity, students use their insights from the unit to analyze and interpret a set of mathematical models and a set of data in context. Each situation involves more than two constraints, and can therefore be represented with a system with more than two inequalities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Interpreting and connecting the inequalities, the graphs, and the data set (which involves decimals) prompts students to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them, and to reason quantitatively and abstractly.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Give students a moment to skim through the task statement and familiarize themselves with the given information. Ask them to be prepared to share one thing they notice and one thing they wonder. Invite students to share their observations and questions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then, to help students interpret the variables in the given inequalities as representing the number of grams of each ingredient, ask them to use the table to write an expression to represent the total amount of fiber if they had a grams of almonds and b grams of raisins. Students should see that the expression is \(0.07a+0.05b\).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Next, ask for an expression representing the total amount of sugar for the same amounts of almonds and raisins \((0.21a+0.60b)\).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Arrange students in groups of 2. Ask them to analyze and answer the questions about one student's trail mix (either Tyler's or Jada's). If time permits, the groups could analyze the other trail mix.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Give students a few minutes of quiet work time and time to share their thinking with their partner. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>
<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Representation: Internalize Comprehension.</em> Demonstrate and encourage students to use color coding and annotations to highlight connections between representations in a problem. For example, highlight values from the table, equations, and graphs in corresponding colors as they discover the connections. Encourage students to label regions of the graph and label variables in addition to color coding to reinforce connections.<br><em>
    Supports accessibility for: Visual-spatial processing</em></p>

<p>Tyler and Jada each designed their own custom trail mix using two of these ingredients. They wrote inequalities and created graphs to represent their constraints.</p>

<li>\(0.67x + 0.07y &lt;30\)</li>

<p>Use the inequalities and graphs to answer these questions about each student's trail mix. Be prepared to explain your reasoning.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>Which two ingredients did they choose?</li>
<li>What do their variables represent?</li>
<li>What does each constraint mean?</li>
<li>Which graph represents which constraint?</li>
<li>Name one possible combination of ingredients for their trail mix.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<p>Tyler:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li><span>Chocolate pieces and shredded coconut</span></li>
<li>x represents grams of chocolate pieces and y represents grams of coconut.</li>
<li>The trail mix contains more than 50 grams of ingredients, a maximum of 400 calories, and less than 30 grams of sugar. The amounts of chocolate pieces and shredded coconut are both positive.</li>
<li>The region with a dashed boundary and sparser line shading represents \(x+y&gt;50\_. The region with a solid boundary and denser line shading represents \(4.76x+6.67y\leq400\). The region with a dashed boundary and blue shading represents \(0.67x+0.07y&lt;30\).</li>
<li>For example: 20 grams of chocolate pieces and 40 grams of shredded coconut</li>
</ol>
<p>Jada:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>Walnuts and dried cherries or walnuts and raisins</li>
<li>w represents grams of walnuts and z represents grams of dried cherries.</li>
<li>The trail mix contains more than 50 grams of ingredients, more than 4 grams of protein, and no more than 15 grams of fat. The amounts of walnuts and dried cherries are both positive.</li>
<li>The region with a dashed boundary and denser line shading represents \(w+z&gt;50\). The region with a dashed boundary and sparser line shading represents \(0.14w+0.03z&gt;4\). The region with a solid boundary and blue shading represents \(0.61w+0z\leq15\).</li>
<li>For example: 22 grams of walnuts and 50 grams of dried cherries</li>
</ol>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Focus the discussion on the connections between the graphs and the inequalities, and on the inequalities \(x&gt;\) and \(y&gt;0\). Ask questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>"How did you know which ingredients each person used?" (By matching the coefficients in two of the inequalities to the nutritional values in the table.)</li>
<li>"The table shows the same values for some nutrients. How can you tell which one Tyler or Jada chose?" (The coefficients of x and y in one inequality and those in the other inequality must be for the same two ingredients.)</li>
<li>"Why do you think Jada and Tyler both included the inequalities \(x&gt;0\) and \(y&gt;0\)?" (There cannot be only one ingredient, so both x and y must be greater than 0.)</li>
<li>"How do those inequalities affect the graph of the solution region?" (They limit the solution region to the first quadrant.)</li>
<li>"Jada and Tyler each wrote five inequalities. Could all five form a single system?" (Yes) What does it mean to have a system with five inequalities?" (There are five constraints that must be met. The solutions to the system satisfy all five constraints simultaneously.)</li>
</ul>
<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<div>
<p>As students discuss their strategies, listen for and collect the language students use to identify and describe the boundary line or shading in their inequalities. Write the students' words and phrases on a visual display and update it throughout the remainder of the lesson. Remind students to borrow language from the display as needed. This will help students read and use mathematical language during their partner and whole-group discussions.</p>
