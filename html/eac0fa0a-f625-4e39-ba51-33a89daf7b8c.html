<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>This activity prompts students to contrast quantities that grow exponentially and quadratically by writing equations
  and creating tables of values. Before students begin working, they are asked to make an estimate of the number of
  squares in each pattern at Step 5 and Step 10. Making a reasonable estimate and comparing a computed value to
  one&rsquo;s estimate is often an important aspect of making sense of problems. Later, from the tables, students notice
  that the output of the exponential function eventually outgrows that of the quadratic function. In the next activity,
  they will think further about whether this is always the case.</p>
<p>If students opt to use spreadsheet or graphing technology, they practice choosing appropriate tools strategically.
</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Display the image of the patterns for all to see and ask students to read the description of how the patterns grow.
  Ask students to predict which pattern will have more small squares in Step 5.</p>
<p>Then, ask students to predict which pattern will have more small squares in Step 10. Poll the class to collect their
  predictions. Display the number of students who think Pattern A will have more small squares and the number who think
  Pattern B will have more small squares.</p>
<p>Arrange students in groups of two. If time is limited, ask partners to each complete the questions for one pattern
  and then work together to compare the patterns and make observations.</p>
<p>Some students may choose to use a spreadsheet tool to study the pattern, and subsequently to use graphing technology
  to plot the data. Others may wish to use a calculator to compute growth factors. Provide access to devices that can
  run a spreadsheet tool, graphing technology, or a scientific calculator.</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>How would the two patterns compare if they continue to grow? Make one to two observations.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>The number of small squares in Pattern B grows much more quickly than the number of squares
  in Pattern A once \(n\) is greater than \(5\). The patterns have the same number of squares when \(n=2\) and when
  \(n=4\).</p>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Some students may write the equation for Pattern B as \(g(n)=2n\). Point out that Pattern B is doubling the number of
  small squares. Step 3 would have \(4\) small squares. Prompt students to test their equation when \(n=3\) to see if it
  gives the correct output. \(g(3)=2(3)=6\), not \(4\), so a linear function does not work. Since Pattern B is doubling,
  the function is exponential, not linear. A linear pattern such as \(2n\) would add \(2\) small squares at each step
  rather than double the number of small squares.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students to share their equations and to display their tables for all to see. Invite others to share their
  observations about the values in the tables.</p>
<p>To help students understand why the value of the exponential function outgrows that of the quadratic function,
  consider showing tables that contrast the output values of \(f\) and \(g\) and amending each with a third column that
  shows their growth factors as \(n\) goes up by \(1\).</p>

<p>Highlight the fact that a fundamental feature of an exponential function is that it changes by equal factors over
  equal intervals. In this exponential function, the output increases by a factor of \(2\) at each step.</p>
<p>In the quadratic function, we can see that the output changes by a factor of \(4\), then \(2\frac {1}{4}\), then \(1
  \frac{7}{9}\), and so on. Even though it started out growing faster than the exponential function, the growth factor
  of the quadratic function decreases at each step and falls below \(2\) after a couple of steps. In the meantime, the
  growth factor of the exponential function stays at \(2\).</p>

<p>Also consider showing the graphs representing the two functions to help students visualize the data in the tables.
  This graph plots the outputs of \(f\) and \(g\) at whole-number inputs.</p>
<p>Discuss how the graphs representing both quadratic and exponential functions curve upward. The two are very close
  together for small values of \(x\). As \(x\) continues to grow, however, the values of \(g\) become much greater than
  those of \(f\) and continue to increase more quickly.</p>
