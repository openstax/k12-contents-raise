<h3> Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>This warm-up is an opportunity to practice interpreting statements in function notation. It also draws attention to statements that correspond to the intercepts of a graph of a function (for instance, \(d(0)\) and \(d(m)=0\)), preparing students to reason about them in the lesson (particularly in the second activity).</p>
<h4>Student Facing Statement</h4>
<p>Diego is walking home from school at a constant rate. This graph represents function \(d\), which gives his distance from home, in kilometers, \(m\) minutes since leaving the school.</p>
<p>Use the graph to find or estimate:</p>
<p><img alt="Graph of line. Horizontal axis, 0 to 24 by 4&rsquo;s, minutes since leaving school. Vertical axis, 0 to 3 by point&nbsp;5&rsquo;s, kilometers from home. Line starts at about 0 comma 2 point 2 5, and ends at 20 comma 0." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/e1edaa833b2861d34842791bee74f5475acd6954"></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>What is \(d(0)\), and what does it represent in the situation?<br></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong> \(d(0)=2.25\); The moment Diego is leaving school, he is 2.25 kilometers from home (or Diego&rsquo;s school is a little more than 2 kilometers from his house).<br></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>\(d(12) =\)<br></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong> \(d(12)=0.9\)<br></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>What does \(d(m)=1\) mean in this context, and what is the value of \(m\)?<br></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong> \(m\) is approximately 10.5. At approximately 10.5 minutes, Diego is 1 kilometer from home.<br></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>What does \(d(m)=0\) mean in this context, and what is the value of \(m\)?<br></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong> \(m\) is 20. At 20 minutes, Diego is at home (or it takes Diego 20 minutes to walk the 2.25 kilometers home from school).<br></p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Ask students to interpret each statement in function notation before soliciting their response to each question. Make sure students understand, for instance, that \(d(0)\) represents Diego&rsquo;s distance from school at the time of leaving (or at 0 minutes), and \(d(m)=0\) represents his distance from school being 0 km, \(m\) minutes after leaving his house.
</p>
<p>If time permits, discuss with students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Is the relationship between Diego&rsquo;s distance from school and time a linear function? How can we tell?&rdquo; (Yes. The graph is a line, which means the function&rsquo;s value changes at a constant rate.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Can we tell from the graph how far away Diego&rsquo;s house is from school? How?&rdquo; (Yes. From the graph, we can see that at the time he leaves school, he 2.25 km from home.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Can we tell from the graph how long it took Diego to get home? How?&rdquo; (Yes. From the graph, we can see the distance reaching 0 when the time is 20 minutes.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Why does the graph slant downward (or have a negative slope)?&rdquo; (As the input, \(m\),&nbsp;increases, the output, \(d(m)\), decreases.)</li>
</ul>
