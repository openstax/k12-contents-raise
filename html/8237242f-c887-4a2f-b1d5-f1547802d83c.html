<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>A function \(A\), defined by \(p(600&minus;75p)\), describes the revenue collected from the sales of tickets for Performance A, a musical.</p>
<p>The graph represents a function \(B\) that models the revenue collected from the sales of tickets for Performance B, a Shakespearean comedy.</p>

<p>In both functions, \(p\) represents the price of one ticket, and both revenues and prices are measured in dollars.</p>

  <p>Compare your answer:</p>
  <p>Performance A.</p>
  <ul class="os-raise-indent">
    <li> The maximum revenue for Performance B is $900 based on the <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">vertex (of a graph)</span> of its graph. For Performance A, the expression \(p(600&minus;75p)\) is in factored form, which tells us that the horizontal intercepts are \((0,0)\) and \((8,0)\). The horizontal coordinate of the vertex is halfway between 0 and 8, which is 4. Substituting 4 for \(p\) in \(p(600&minus;75p)\) gives 1200, so the vertex is at \((4,1200)\). 1200 is greater than 900. </li>
    <li> The maximum revenue for Performance B is $900 based on the vertex of its graph. The expression \(p(600&minus;75p)\) can be rewritten in <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">vertex form (of a quadratic expression)</span>: \(-75(p&minus;4)^2+1200\), which tells us that the vertex of a graph of the function is at \((4,1200)\) and that the maximum revenue is $1200. </li>
  </ul>
