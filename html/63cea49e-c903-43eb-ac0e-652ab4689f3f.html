<h4>Meanings in Functions </h4>
<p>Review the following examples to help you gain a better understanding of meanings in functions. </p>
<p><strong>Example 1 </strong></p>
<p>The number of cubic yards of dirt, \(D\), needed to cover a garden with an area of \(a\) square feet is given by \(D=g(a)\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="A">
  <li>A garden with area 5000 \(ft^2\) requires 50 \(yd^3\) of dirt. Express this information in terms of the function \(g\).
    <br>
    <strong>Solution:</strong>&nbsp;\(g(5000)=50\)<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Explain the meaning of the statement \(g(100)=1\).
    <br>
    <strong>Solution:</strong> The number of cubic yards of dirt required for a garden of 100 square feet is 1. <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Let \(f(t)\) be the number of ducks in a lake \(t\) years after 1990. Explain the meaning of each statement:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="A">
  <li>\(f(5)=30\)<br>
    <strong>Solution:</strong> In 1995 (5 years after 1990), there were 30 ducks in the lake.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>\(f(10)=40\)<br>
    <strong>Solution:</strong> In 2000 (10 years after 1990), there were 40 ducks in the lake.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Try It: Meanings in Functions</h4>
<p>The amount of garbage, \(G\), produced by a city with population \(p\) is given by \(G=f(p)\). \(G\) is measured in tons per week, and \(p\) is measured in thousands of people.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="A">
  <li>The town of Tola has a population of 40,000 and produces 13 tons of garbage each week. Express this information in terms of the function \(f\).</li>
  <li>Explain the meaning of the statement \(f(5)=2\).</li>
