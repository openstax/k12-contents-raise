<h4>Multiplying Binomials with Negative Numbers</h4>
<p>In a previous lesson, you learned how to square a binomial.</p>
<p>\((a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2\) and \((a-b)^2=a^2-2ab+b^2\)</p>
<p>You can use this to solve the following example.</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 1</p>
<p>Find the expression equivalent to \((x-3)^2\).</p>
<p>This means to multiply \((x-3)\) by \((x-3)\). So, \((x-3)^2=(x-3)(x-3)\).</p>
<p>Now, distribute. Remember, you can use FOIL.</p>

<p>Distribute the \(x\) to the second binomial, then distribute the \(– 3\) to the second binomial.</p>
<p>Then, combine like terms.</p>
<p>The expression becomes \(x^2-3x-3x+9=x^2-6x+9\).</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example 2</p>
<p>Find the expression equivalent to \((x-4)(x+2)\). </p>
<p>First, distribute. Remember, you can use FOIL.</p>
<p><img alt="A diagram showing the quantity of x minus 4 times the quantity of x plus 2. On the top, a blue arrow is going from x in the first binomial to x in the second binomial. Another blue arrow is going from x in the first binomial to 2 in the second binomial. On the bottom, in red, an arrow is going from negative 4 in the first binomial to x in the second binomial and then another arrow is going from negative 4 in the first binomial to 2 in the second binomial." height="82" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/02675aa79ce8960db9695bd5309df7a3e95c1b00" width="150"/></p>
<p>Multiply the \(x\) by \((x+2)\), then multiply the \(– 4\) by \((x+2)\) and combine like terms:</p>
<p>\(x^2+2x-4x-8=x^2-2x+8\).</p>
