<h4>Multiplying Binomials with Negative Numbers</h4>
<p>In a previous lesson, you learned how to square a binomial.</p>
<p>\((a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2\) and \((a-b)^2=a^2-2ab+b^2\)</p>
<p>You can use this to solve the following example.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Find the expression equivalent to \((x-3)^2\).</p>
<p>This means to multiply \((x-3)\) by \((x-3)\). So, \((x-3)^2=(x-3)(x-3)\).</p>
<p>Now, distribute. Remember, you can use FOIL.</p>

ON THE BOTTOM, IN BLUE, AN ARROW IS GOING FROM NEGATIVE 3 TO X. ANOTHER ARROW IS GOING FROM NEGATIVE 3 TO NEGATIVE 3." height="82" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/fe81cb9ca5c422b7f593af3c6569e81a494b6dc9" width="150"></p>
<p>Distribute the \(x\) to the second binomial, then distribute the \(&ndash; 3\) to the second binomial.</p>
<p>Then, combine like terms.</p>
<p>The expression becomes \(x^2-3x-3x+9=x^2-6x+9\).</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Find the expression equivalent to \((x-4)(x+2)\). </p>
<p>First, distribute. Remember, you can use FOIL.</p>
<p><img alt="DIAGRAM SHOWING X MINUS 4 MULTIPLIED BY X PLUS 2. ON THE TOP, IN RED, AN ARROW IS GOING FROM X TO X. ANOTHER ARROW IS GOING FROM X TO 2. ON THE BOTTOM, IN BLUE, AN ARROW IS GOING FROM NEGATIVE 4 TO X. ANOTHER ARROW IS GOING FROM NEGATIVE 4 TO 2." height="82" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/02675aa79ce8960db9695bd5309df7a3e95c1b00" width="150"></p>
<p>Multiply the \(x\) by \((x+2)\), then multiply the \(&ndash; 4\) by \((x+2)\) and combine like terms:</p>
<p>\(x^2+2x-4x-8=x^2-2x+8\).</p>

<p>Here is how to find an equivalent expression:</p>
<p>Distribute the \(x\) to \((x-3)\), and then distribute the \(5\) to \((x-3)\). Remember, you can use FOIL.</p>
