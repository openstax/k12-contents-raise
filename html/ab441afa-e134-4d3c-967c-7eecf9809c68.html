<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>Prior to this point, students have had multiple opportunities to interpret graphs of functions in terms of a situation. In most cases, students were given some information about the units of measurement of at least one quantity, which helped them reason about the functions being represented.</p>
<p>In this activity, students encounter graphs without units on either of the axes. They interpret the graphs in the context of raising a flag and make a case for whether the graphs are realistic (which may depend on the units chosen for the axes). Students also see for the first time a graph that is a vertical line and think about why this graph does not represent a function.</p>
<p>As students relate features of graphs to behaviors of quantities in a situation, they reason quantitatively and abstractly. In explaining and discussing why a graph is or is not realistic, students practice constructing logical arguments and critiquing the reasoning of others.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Show pictures of a flag ceremony and describe flag raising to students who might be unfamiliar with it. Consider sharing that, in some countries, students hold a flag-raising ceremony on a daily or weekly basis.</p>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Ask students to read the task statement and look at the graphs. Then, give students a moment of quiet time to think about the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;What might be reasonable units to use for the axes of the graphs?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How do we know that each graph represents a function?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Give students a moment to share their thinking with their partner. Follow with a brief whole-class discussion.</p>
<p>Students are likely to suggest seconds as a reasonable unit to use for time and meters or yards as a reasonable unit for height. If these units are not mentioned, ask students about them.</p>
<p>Next, tell partners to take turns interpreting the graphs in the first question. Ask students to pause for a discussion before moving to the second question.</p>
<p>If utilizing the extension, make sure students are given instructions on how to use graphing technology appropriately, even if it is a review. If students have not used this technology before, the teacher can still utilize the technology and show students the graphs to facilitate answering questions.</p>
<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>
<div>
  <p>Encourage and support opportunities for peer interactions. Invite students to talk about their ideas with a partner before writing them down. Display sentence frames to support students when they explain their strategy. For example, &ldquo;I notice that . . .,&rdquo; &ldquo;I wonder . . .,&rdquo; and &ldquo;That could/couldn&rsquo;t be true because . . . .&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<h4>Student-Facing Statement </h4>
<p>A flag ceremony is held at a Fourth of July event. The height of the flag is a function of time.</p>
<p>Here are some graphs that could each be a possible representation of the function.</p>

<h4>Student Response</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Sample response (assuming that time is measured in seconds and height in meters):</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>Graph A: The flag starts out on the ground but is immediately raised at a constant rate.</li>
  <li>Graph B: The flag starts out at 3 meters above ground and then stays at that height the entire time.</li>
  <li>Graph C: The flag starts out on the ground but gets pulled up quickly. The movement slows down and there is a brief pause, and then it is raised up again at a quicker and quicker rate.</li>
  <li>Graph D: The flag starts out on the ground, is raised up a couple of meters, and then is lowered back to the ground. This happens repeatedly.</li>
  <li>Graph E: The flag starts out at 0.5 meter above the ground and is raised up bit by bit, with a brief pause before it is raised farther.</li>
  <li>Graph F: The flag starts out on the ground and is raised up at a constant speed for 3 seconds. It stops abruptly and comes back down at a constant speed. Then, 2 seconds later, it stops at 3 meters above the ground.<br>
    <br>
    <ol start="2" type="a">
      <li>Graph E seems the most realistic. Graphs B and D are the least realistic. Graphs A, C, and F are possible, but it is unlikely that the flag starts out being on the ground.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
  <li>Sample response (assuming that time is measured in seconds and height in meters):
    <ol type="a">
      <li> No. This graph shows the flag being at all heights between 0 and 6 meters at 3 seconds of time, which is impossible.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Sample response (assuming that time is measured in seconds and height in meters):
        <br>
        No, it is not a graph of a function. A function has only one output for every input. This graph shows many possible outputs when the input is 3.

    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Student-Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>Suppose an ant is moving at a rate of 1 millimeter per second and keeps going at that rate for a long time.
  If time, \(x\), is measured in seconds, then the distance the ant has traveled in millimeters, \(y\), is \(y=1x\). If time, \(x\), is measured in minutes, the distance in millimeters is \(y=60x\). </p>
<ol>
  <li>Explain why the equation \(y=(365\cdot24\cdot3600)x\) gives the distance the ant has traveled, in millimeters, as a function of time, \(x\), in years.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
  <li>Use graphing technology to graph the equation.
    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>\(x\)-axis: time (years), \(y\)-axis: distance traveled (millimeters)
      <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>Graph the equation on a coordinate grid or using graphing technology.
      <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>Does the graph look like that of a function? Why do you think it looks this way?
      <br>
      <br>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <li>Adjust the graphing window until the graph no longer looks this way. If you manage to do so, describe the graphing window that you use.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
  <li>Do you think the last graph in the flag activity could represent a function relating time and height of the flag? Explain your reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Extension Student Response </h4>
<ol>
  <li>Sample response: The number of seconds in a year is \(365\cdot24\cdot60\cdot60\). If the ant travels 1 millimeter a second, in one year, it would travel \(365\cdot24\cdot3600\) millimeters. In \(x\) years, it would travel \((365\cdot24\cdot3600)x\) millimeters.</li>

      <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>Sample response: The graph is a vertical line and doesn&rsquo;t look like a graph of a function. The slope is really large, so the line is so steep that it looks vertical. </li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
  <li>Sample response: The graph is a slanted line when the \(x\)-axis is scaled from &ndash;0.0001 to 0.0001 years and the \(y\)-axis is scaled to ten thousands in both directions.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
  <li>Sample response: Flag F can represent a function because every input goes to exactly one output.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students to explain what each graph means in the context of flag raising and give an argument as to why it is or is not realistic. Consider asking partners to illustrate their response together&mdash;one partner explaining what is happening with the flag and the other acting out the action of the flag raiser.</p>
<p>Discuss with students which graph is the most realistic and why. Also discuss whether using certain units of measurements would make an unrealistic graph more realistic, or vice versa. (For example, none of the graphs would be realistic if the time is measured in days or months and the height in kilometers or centimeters.)</p>
<p>Next, solicit some explanations as to why the vertical line does not represent a function. If not mentioned in students&rsquo; explanations, bring up a key point: A vertical line can be interpreted to mean that for one particular input (3 units of time, in this case), there is an infinite number of possible outputs. Therefore, it cannot represent a function.</p>

<p>Here is how to write a story based on the graph of this function:</p>
<p>Sample Response:</p>
<p>Jameson was sick and did not work for almost a whole week. Then, he mowed several lawns over the next few days and deposited the money into his account after each job. It rained several days, so instead of working, Jameson withdrew money from his account each day to go to the movies and out to lunch with friends.</p>
