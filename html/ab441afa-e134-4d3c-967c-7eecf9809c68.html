<h4>Activity (20 minutes)</h4>
<p>Prior to this point, students have had multiple opportunities to interpret graphs of functions in terms of a situation. In most cases, students were given some information about the units of measurement of at least one quantity, which helped them reason about the functions being represented.</p>
<p>In this activity, students encounter graphs without units on either of the axes. They interpret the graphs in the context of raising a flag and make a case for whether the graphs are realistic (which may depend on the units chosen for the axes). Students also see for the first time a graph that is a vertical line and think about why this graph does not represent a function.</p>
<p>As students relate features of graphs to behaviors of quantities in a situation, they reason quantitatively and abstractly. In explaining and discussing why a graph is or is not realistic, students practice constructing logical arguments and critiquing the reasoning of others.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Show pictures of a flag ceremony and describe flag raising to students who might be unfamiliar with it. Consider sharing that, in some countries, students hold a flag-raising ceremony on a daily or weekly basis.</p>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Ask students to read the task statement and look at the graphs. Then, give students a moment of quiet time to think about the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;What might be reasonable units to use for the axes of the graphs?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How do we know that each graph represents a function?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Give students a moment to share their thinking with their partner. Follow with a brief whole-class discussion.</p>
<p>Students are likely to suggest seconds as a reasonable unit to use for time and meters or yards as a reasonable unit for height. If these units are not mentioned, ask students about them.</p>
<p>Next, tell partners to take turns interpreting the graphs in the first question. Ask students to pause for a discussion before moving to the second question.</p>
<p>If utilizing the extension, make sure students are given instructions on how to use graphing technology appropriately, even if it is a review. If students have not used this technology before, the teacher can still utilize the technology and show students the graphs to facilitate answering questions.</p>

<h4>Student Activity </h4>
<p>A flag ceremony is held at a Fourth of July event. The height of the flag is a function of time.</p>
<p>Here are some graphs that could each be a possible representation of the function.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
  <li><img alt="A graph.&nbsp;" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/96eed93f919fb73938b1aa2ebe854ac9d30b3b55"></li>

  <li><img alt="A graph.&nbsp;" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/678c1d2a7cd1d09f1be8fecccc314f56f17f7a42"></li>
  <li><img alt="A graph.&nbsp;" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/531e8c9896f608efcf09e544cf1805d0c7491cc3"></li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>After you examine the graphs, discuss with a partner how each graph could be used to describe the movement of the flag as it is raised on the flagpole.
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here are some samples.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Graph A: The flag starts out on the ground but is immediately raised at a constant rate.</li>
      <li>Graph B: The flag starts out at 3 meters above ground and then stays at that height the entire time.</li>
      <li>Graph C: The flag starts out on the ground but gets pulled up quickly. The movement slows down and there is a brief pause, and then it is raised up again at a quicker and quicker rate.</li>
      <li>Graph D: The flag starts out on the ground, is raised up a couple of meters, and then is lowered back to the ground. This happens repeatedly.</li>
      <li>Graph E: The flag starts out at 0.5 meter above the ground and is raised up bit by bit, with a brief pause before it is raised farther.</li>
      <li>Graph F: The flag starts out on the ground and is raised up at a constant speed for 3 seconds. It stops abruptly and comes back down at a constant speed. Then, 2 seconds later, it stops at 3 meters above the ground.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>Which graph seems the most realistic and likely to happen at a flag ceremony? Be prepared to explain your reasoning.
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Graph E seems the most realistic. It starts at a height where someone would link the flag to the rope and then it rises in spurts like the movement that might happen as someone pulls on the string.</p>
  </li>

  <li>Which graphs seem most unrealistic or least likely to happen at a flag ceremony? Be prepared to explain your reasoning.
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Graphs B and D are the least realistic. On graph B, the flag seems to be attached to the flagpole at one height and then it is never moved up the flagpole. On graph D, the person who raises the flag seems to put it on the ground and then raise it, lower it, raise it, lower it, etc.</p>
  </li>

  <li>Which graphs might be possible, but seem unlikely? Be prepared to explain your reasoning.
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Graphs A, C, and F are possible, but it is unlikely that the flag starts out being on the ground.</p>
  </li>

  <li>Can this graph represent the time and height of the flag? Be prepared to show your reasoning.
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> If we assume that time is measured in seconds and the height is measured in meters, this graph would not represent the height of a flag raised at a flag ceremony. The graph shows the flag being at all heights between 0 and 6 meters at the same time (3 seconds), which is impossible.</p>
  </li>

  <li>Is this a graph of a function? Be prepared to show your reasoning.
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> This graph does not represent a function. A function has only one output for every input. If we assume that time is measured in seconds and the height is measured in meters, this graph shows many possible outputs when the input is 3 seconds.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>Suppose an ant is moving at a rate of 1 millimeter per second and keeps going at that rate for a long time. Explain why the equation \(y=(365\cdot24\cdot3600)x\) gives the distance the ant has traveled, in millimeters, as a function of time, \(x\), in years.
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> For example: The number of seconds in a year is \(365\cdot24\cdot60\cdot60\). If the ant travels 1 millimeter a second, in one year, it would travel \(365\cdot24\cdot3600\) millimeters. In \(x\) years, it would travel \((365\cdot24\cdot3600)x\) millimeters.</p>
</li>

<li>Use the Desmos graphing tool or technology outside the course to graph the equation.
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> (This section requires an action rather than an answer.)</p>
</li>

<li>Does the graph look like that of a function? Why do you think it looks this way?
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The graph is a vertical line and doesn’t look like a graph of a function. The slope is really large, so the line is so steep that it looks vertical.</p>
</li>

<li>Using graphing technology, adjust the graphing window until the graph no longer looks this way. If you manage to do so, describe the graphing window that you use.
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The graph is a slanted line when the \(x\)-axis is scaled from &ndash;0.0001 to 0.0001 years and the \(y\)-axis is scaled to ten thousands in both directions.</p>
</li>

<li>Do you think the last graph in the flag activity, Graph F, could represent a function relating time and height of a flag? Explain your reasoning.
  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> It could, depending on the unit of time being used and the scale of the horizontal and vertical axes. If the time is measured in months, for instance, each point on the graph could represent a time value that is just a tiny bit more than 3 months—say, 3 months and 1 second, 3 months and 2 seconds, and so on. A horizontal change of 1 second would not be visible when the horizontal units are measured in months, so all input-output pairs marking the height of the flag at each second would appear to be stacked exactly on top of one another.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students to explain what each graph means in the context of flag raising and give an argument as to why it is or is not realistic. Consider asking partners to illustrate their response together&mdash;one partner explaining what is happening with the flag and the other acting out the action of the flag raiser.</p>
<p>Discuss with students which graph is the most realistic and why. Also discuss whether using certain units of measurements would make an unrealistic graph more realistic, or vice versa. (For example, none of the graphs would be realistic if the time is measured in days or months and the height in kilometers or centimeters.)</p>
<p>Next, solicit some explanations as to why the vertical line does not represent a function. If not mentioned in students&rsquo; explanations, bring up a key point: A vertical line can be interpreted to mean that for one particular input (3 units of time, in this case), there is an infinite number of possible outputs. Therefore, it cannot represent a function.</p>
