<p>In this lesson, you will use rules of functions to find the output when the input is given (or to evaluate functions) and to find the input when the output is known (or to solve equations that define functions). To make connections between different representations of functions, you will interpret rules of functions by comparing cell phone data plans to choose the most cost-effective plan. </p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Use technology to graph a function given in function notation, and use the graph to find the values of the function.</li>
  <li>Be able to identify if a graph represents a function through the vertical line test.</li>
  <li>Explain different ways to find the value of a function and to solve equations written in function notation.<br></li>
  <li>Explain what makes a function a linear function.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
