<h3>Activity (20 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students convert functions in factored or standard form to vertex form then convert vertex form to standard form. Previously, in the warm up, students used the vertex form to find the maximum or minimum of the quadratic function. This activity supports students by focusing on the mechanics of changing forms and finding the coordinates of the vertex.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Begin with a class discussion asking students to name the different forms of quadratic functions (vertex, standard, and factored forms) and their formulas. The vertex and standard forms are given on the <a href="https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/staar-algebra-1-reference-materials.pdf">STARR Algebra I Reference Materials</a>. Ask students what useful information they can get easily from each form. (For example: Standard form helps to find intercepts, factored form helps to find roots, vertex form is helpful for the vertex and axis of symmetry).</p>
<p>Divide the class into pairs. Practice the sage and scribe technique. For question 1, one person is the sage and describes how to do the problem, and the other partner is the scribe and writes the mathematical work. They then enter their answer and reflect on the feedback. They then describe the steps in words on their paper for each step. For example, complete the square by dividing \(b\) by 2 and squaring the result. For question 2, they switch roles and continue to switch roles throughout the activity.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>

<h4>Student Facing Extension</h4>
<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>
<p>A ball is thrown upward from the top of a 40 foot high building at a speed of 80 feet per second. The ball&rsquo;s height above ground can be modeled by the equation \(H(t)=-16t^2+80t+40\). What is the maximum height?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>To find the maximum height, find the vertex. Write the function in vertex form.</p>
<p>\(H(t)=-16t^2+80t+40\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Factor -16 out of the first two terms.<br>
\(H(t)=-16(t^2+5t)+40 \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 </strong>- Complete the square.<br>
\((\frac{5}{2})^2=\frac{25}{4}\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Add the constant to complete the square and subtract from the 40 to balance the equation. Note that because there is a -16 outside of the parentheses, \(a -16 \times \frac{25}{4}=-100\) was really added in. A positive 100 will be the balance.<br>
\(H(t)=-16(t^2+5t+\frac{25}{4})+40+100 \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Factor and simplify.<br>
\(H(t)=-16(t+\frac{5}{2})^2+140\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> - Find the vertex.<br>
\((-\frac52,\;140)\)</p>
<br>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>When writing from standard or factored form to vertex form, students may not remember to subtract the new constant they add in when they complete the square to balance the equation. Encourage students who struggle with this concept to use a different color to write the number that completes the square and then the same number when it is subtracted from the original constant.</p>
<p>When writing from factored to vertex form, students may forget to distribute the two factors first and distribute the factors thoroughly. Reminding them of the acronym, FOIL, can be helpful.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Have students reflect on the Sage or Scribe activity. Ask them if they changed how they explained their work to the Scribe. Did they need to be more specific? Use more mathematical terms? Which role was easier? Did they learn anything from their partner when they were a Scribe and listening to the steps?</p>

<br>
<div class="os-raise-graybox"><h5>Support for English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities</h5>
<p>For the Sage or Scribe activity, allow the ELL student to choose the role where they are most comfortable, first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When speaking as the sage, students should focus on practicing to&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li> distinguish sounds and intonation patterns of English with increasing ease </li>
  <li> practice producing sounds of newly acquired vocabulary such as long and short vowels, silent letters, and consonant clusters to pronounce English words in a manner that is increasingly comprehensible </li>
  <li> learn relationships between sounds and letters of the English language and decode (sound out) words using a combination of skills such as recognizing sound-letter relationships and identifying cognates, affixes, roots, and base words </li>
</ul>
<p>When writing the steps as the scribe and describing the steps on paper during their feedback reflection students will work to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> learn relationships between sounds and letters of the English language to represent sounds when writing in English </li>
  <li> recognize elements of the English sound system in newly acquired vocabulary such as long and short vowels, silent letters, and consonant clusters </li>
</ul>
<p>Monitor English language learners for progress on the above as they listen, write, and speak.</p></div>

<h3>9.9.2: Additional Resources</h3>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold"><em>The following content is available to students who would like more support based on their experience with the self check. Students will not automatically have access to this content, so you may wish to share it with those who could benefit from it.</em></p>
<h4>Writing Quadratics in Different Forms</h4>
<br>
<div class="os-raise-graybox"><p><strong>Three Common Quadratic Forms:</strong><br>
The standard form of a quadratic function is \(f(x)=ax^2+bx+c\) where \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), are real numbers and \(a \neq 0\).</p>
<p>The vertex form of a quadratic function is \(f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k\) where \((h, k)\) is the vertex.</p>
<p>The factored form of the quadratic function is \(f(x)=(x-a)(x-b)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are roots of \(f(x)\).</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>For questions 1 and 2, use the function \(f(x)=(x-2)(x+8)\).</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Write the function in standard form. </li>
</ol>
<p>First, multiply the binomials using distribution (FOIL).<br>
\(f(x)=(x-2)(x+8)\)<br>
\(f(x)=x^2-2x+8x-16\)</p>
<p>Then, simplify.<br>
\(f(x)=x^2+6x-16\)</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li> Write the function from question 2 in vertex form. </li>
</ol>
<p>To begin, complete the square.<br>
\((\frac{b}{2})^2=(\frac{6}{2})^2=9\)</p>
<p>Balance the equation. Add the constant to the quadratic to complete the square and subtract it from the original constant.<br>
\(f(x)=x^2+6x+9-16-9\)</p>
<p>Finally, factor the trinomial and simplify.<br>
\(f(x)=(x+3)^2-25\)</p>
<br>
<h4>Try It: Writing Quadratic Functions in Equivalent Forms</h4>
<p>Write the function \(f(x)=(x+5)(x+3)\) in vertex form.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
First, multiply the binomials using distribution (FOIL).<br>
\(f(x)=(x+5)(x+3)\)<br>
\(f(x)=x^2+5x+3x+15\)</p>
<p>Then, simplify.<br>
\(f(x)=x^2+8x+15\)</p>
<p>Now, write this function in vertex form.<br>
Begin by completing the square.<br>
\((\frac{b}{2})^2=(\frac{8}{2})^2=16\)</p>
<p>Balance the equation. Add the constant to the quadratic to complete the square and subtract it from the original constant.<br>
\(f(x)=x^2+8x+16+15-16\)</p>
<p>Finally, factor the trinomial and simplify.<br>
\(f(x)=(x+4)^2-1\)</p>
