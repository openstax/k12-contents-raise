<h3>Causal Relationships <br/></h3>
<br/>
<p>A
  panel is rating different kinds of potato chips. The scatter plot below
  shows the relationship between their average rating and the price of the
  chips, along with the line of best fit. How could the variables be
  related?</p><img alt="Graph of a scatter plot and its line of best fit on a coordinate plane. The x-axis represents the price of the chips in dollars and the y-axis represents the average number of points the chips were rated." height="335" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b4ff57162711ed1b7bbf9269ea20bedf3a3fea82" width="361"/>
<br/><br/>
<p>As the price of a bag of chips in dollars increases, the average rating of the bag of chips in points increases. </p>
<p>Does this represent a causal relationship or simply an association? </p>
<p>In this situation, the independent variable, price, does not seem to cause the rating a person gives the chips. While there appears to be a positive association, there are other factors that may cause the ratings for a bag of chips to go up. For instance, advertising on tv or social media might cause a particular kind of chip to increase in ratings without a change in their price. </p>
