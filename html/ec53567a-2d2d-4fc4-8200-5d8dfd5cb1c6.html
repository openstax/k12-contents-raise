<p dir="ltr">In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Analyze the structure of an inequality in one variable to help determine if the solution is greater or less than the solution to the related equation.</li>
  <li>Write and solve inequalities to answer questions about a situation.</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
<p dir="ltr">Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:<br></p>
<ul>
  <li>2.9.1: Writing an Inequality to Represent a Constraint
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you practiced writing an inequality to represent a constraint, reasoning about its solutions, and interpreting the solutions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>2.9.2: Using Inequalities to Solve a Problem
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you used inequalities to solve a problem about a situation whose constraints might be unfamiliar and in which multiple quantities are unknown.</li>
  </li>
  <li>2.9.2: Self Check</li>
  <li>2.9.2: Additional Resources</li>
    </ul>

  <li>2.9.3: Different Ways of Solving an Inequality
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you explored some ways to decide whether the solution set to an inequality is greater than or less than a particular boundary value (identified by solving a related equation).</li>
  </li>
  <li>2.9.3: Self Check</li>
  <li>2.9.3: Additional Resources</li>
    </ul>

  <li>2.9.4: Matching Inequalities and Solutions (Optional)
    <ul>
      <li>In this optional activity, you received additional practice in reasoning about the solutions to inequalities without any context.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>2.9.5: Solving Inequalities
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you used the Addition and Subtraction Properties of Inequality to solve different inequalities. You also used the Multiplication and Division Properties of Inequality to solve inequalities. You learned that when using the Multiplication and Division Properties of Inequality, you must reverse the symbol when you multiply or divide by a negative number.</li>
  </li>
  <li>2.9.5: Self Check</li>
  <li>2.9.5: Additional Resources</li>
    </ul>

  <li>2.9.6: Writing Inequalities to Represent a Situation
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you wrote inequalities to represent a situation.<br></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
  <p dir="ltr">After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
