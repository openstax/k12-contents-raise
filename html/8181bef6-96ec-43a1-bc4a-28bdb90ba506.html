<p>Some key takeaways from this lesson are the ideas that real-life situations often involve constraints and that we can use expressions, equations, and inequalities to represent these constraints.</p>
<p>To help students see these points, discuss questions such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;In planning a pizza party, what were some ways we gathered information to estimate the cost?&rdquo; (counting the number of students, researching actual prices)</li>
<li>&ldquo;What were some assumptions we made?&rdquo; (pizza preferences, number of slices per person, possible prices of pizza)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Suppose we had gathered information differently, for instance, by asking every student the exact pizza toppings and number of slices. Would that have been a reasonable approach? How would that have changed the cost estimate?&rdquo; (It would be inefficient to take exact orders, cost much more, and likely mean a lot of leftovers.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Suppose we had made a different set of assumptions, for instance, assuming that everyone loved pepperoni and would like only 1 slice. How would that have changed the cost estimate?&rdquo; (If the assumption was a slice of pepperoni pizza per person, it would probably cost less, but many students might not be able to enjoy the pizza or might not have enough.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;In planning the party, we saw some examples of constraints. Can you think of some constraints in other situations? What might be some constraints in, say, planning a field trip, or in organizing a community service event?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Tell students that expressions, equations, and inequalities are mathematical models. A model is a mathematical representation of a real-life situation. When people create models, they rely on the information they have, but they also make assumptions and decisions that affect the models. If the information or assumptions change, the model would also change.</p>
