<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>The mathematical purpose of this lesson is for students to find and interpret the correlation coefficient and to use it to understand the strength of a linear relationship.  The work of this lesson connects to previous work because students plotted and analyzed residuals to informally assess the fit of linear models. The work of this lesson connects to upcoming work because students will use technology to compute the correlation coefficient and use it to describe the relationship between two variables.</p>
<p>When students sorted scatter plots, they were given the opportunity to analyze representations, statements, and structures closely and make connections. When students take turns with a partner, matching graphs of residuals to scatter plots that display linear models with the correlation coefficient, students trade roles explaining their thinking and listening, providing opportunities to explain their reasoning and critique the reasoning of others.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Match the correlation coefficient to its appropriate scatter plot and linear model.</li>
  <li>Use the correlation coefficient to determine how well a linear model fits a data set.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Describe the &ldquo;goodness of fit&rdquo; of a linear model using the correlation coefficient.</li>
  <li>Match the correlation coefficient with a scatter plot and linear model.</li>
</ul>

  <h5> Support for English Language Learners</h5>
 <p> Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS.  The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners.  Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p>
  &nbsp;<br>
  <ul>
    <li>ELPS 1(E) internalize new basic and academic language by using and reusing it in meaningful ways in speaking and writing activities that build concept and language attainment</li>
    <li>ELPS 2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
    <li>ELPS 3(B) expand and internalize initial English vocabulary by learning and using high-frequency English words necessary for identifying and describing people, places, and objects, by retelling simple stories and basic information represented or supported by pictures, and by learning and using routine language needed for classroom communication </li>
    <li>ELPS 3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions </li>
    <li>ELPS 3(F) ask and give information ranging from using a very limited bank of high-frequency, high-need, concrete vocabulary, including key words and expressions needed for basic communication in academic and social contexts, to using abstract and content-based vocabulary during extended speaking assignments</li>
  </ul>
