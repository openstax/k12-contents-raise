<p>Prior to this point, you have worked primarily with equations in one and
  two variables. In this lesson, you will shift your attention to
  inequalities. You will interpret, write, and find solutions to
  inequalities in one variable. </p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Write inequalities that represent the constraints in a situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities </strong>that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2.7.1: Understanding Inequality Symbols</li>
  <li>2.7.2: Identifying Constraints in Inequalities<ul>
      <li>2.7.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>
      <li>2.7.2: Additional Resources&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>2.7.3: Writing Inequalities to Represent Constraints<ul>
      <li>2.7.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>
      <li>2.7.3: Additional Resources&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>
