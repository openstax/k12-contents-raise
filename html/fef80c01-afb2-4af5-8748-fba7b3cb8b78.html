<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The mathematical purpose of this activity is for students to be able to visually assess the best line that fits data among a set of choices. Students are given a scatter plot and 2 lines that may fit the data. Students must select the line that better fits the data. The given lines address many common errors in student thinking about best fit lines, including: going through the most points, dividing the data in half, and connecting the points on both ends of the scatter plot.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Listen for students using the terms slope and \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Provide students access to the images. Give students 2 minutes of quiet time to work on the questions.</p>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Which of the lines is the better fit for the data in each scatter plot? Explain your reasoning.</p>

<h4>Student Response</h4>
<p></p>
<ol>
  <li>Sample response: The solid line is the better fit for the data since it goes through the middle of the data and follows the negative trend of the data.</li>
  <li>Sample response: The solid line is the better fit for the data since it goes through the middle of the data with approximately equal numbers of data points on either side of the line.</li>
  <li>Sample response: The dashed line is the better fit for the data since it goes through the middle of the data with a slope that follows the trend of the data. The solid line has a lot of points above the line to start and a lot of points below the line at the end.</li>
  <li>Sample response: The dashed line is the better fit for the data since it goes through the middle of the data, follows the trend of the data, and has a similar number of points on each side. The solid line fits the first and last point perfectly, but most of the data points are above the line.</li>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>The purpose of this discussion is to understand bad fit, good fit, and best fit. In each scatter plot, the solid line represents the line of best fit&mdash;except for the last two graphs, for which the dashed line is the best fit.</p>
<p>Ask a student who uses the term slope while working the questions, &ldquo;Can you explain the relationship between the two lines in the question about runs and wins using the concept of slope?&rdquo; (The slope of the dashed line is positive, and the slope of the solid line is negative.)</p>
<p>Ask a student who uses the term \(y\)-intercept, &ldquo;Can you explain the significance of the \(y\)-intercept<span>&nbsp;in the question about average survey scores and amount spent on dinner?&rdquo; (The solid line will have a \(y\)-intercept less than the \(y\)-intercept for the dashed line. Because the two lines have approximately the same slope, they appear parallel in the scatter plot.)</span></p>
<p>If time permits, discuss questions such as:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Is the dashed line in the question about runs and wins a bad fit, good fit, or best fit?&rdquo; (The line is a bad fit because it does not show the correct relationship between the variables. It shows that the value of \(y\) increases as the value of \(x\) increases, rather than the value of \(y\) decreasing as the value of \(x\) increases.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Is the dashed line in the question about oil and gas price a bad fit, good fit, or best fit?&rdquo; (It is the best fit because it is close to going through the middle of the data and follows the same trend as the data.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;What factors helped you select the linear model that fits the data best?&rdquo; (The line should go through the middle of the data, follow the trend of the data, and have a similar number of points on each side of the line.)</li>
</ul>
