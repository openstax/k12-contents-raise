<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Write the slope of a line. </li>
<li> Write the equation of a line in different forms. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li> 4.7.1: Evaluating Fractions </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you simplified fractions that involved adding and subtracting in both the numerator and denominator. </li>
</ul>
<li> 4.7.2: Finding Slope From Tables, Graphs, and Points </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you learned how to find the slope using the slope formula, given two coordinates, a graph of a line, and a table of values. </li>
<li> 4.7.2: Self Check </li>
<li> 4.7.2: Additional Resources </li>
</ul>
<li> 4.7.3: Writing Linear Equations </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you learned how to write equations in three different forms and also created equivalent equations by writing the equations into the different forms. </li>
<li> 4.7.3: Self Check </li>
<li> 4.7.3: Additional Resources </li>
</ul>
<li> 4.7.4: Writing Equations From Two Points </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you put everything together to write equations in all three forms, given two points which you used to find the slope of the line. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
