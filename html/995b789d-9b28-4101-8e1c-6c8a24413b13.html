<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Use the radical and "plus-minus" symbols to represent solutions to quadratic equations. </li>
<li> Explain why the plus-minus symbol is used when solving quadratic equations by finding square roots. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li> 9.5.1: Roots of Squares </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you found the area and side lengths of squares to explore square roots. </li>
</ul>
<li> 9.5.2: Solutions Written as Square Roots </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you solved quadratic equations that had radicals left in the solutions. </li>
<li> 9.5.2: Self Check </li>
<li> 9.5.2: Additional Resources </li>
</ul>
<li> 9.5.3: Finding Irrational Solutions by Completing the Square </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you solved quadratic equations by completing the square. You graphed the equations to find the approximate solutions using a graphing calculator. </li>
<li> 9.5.3: Self Check </li>
<li> 9.5.3: Additional Resources </li>
</ul>
<li> 9.5.4: Finding Exact Solutions </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you solved quadratic equations and used a calculator to approximate the actual solution(s). </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
