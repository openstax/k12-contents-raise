<h3>Activity (10 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity builds on students' prior knowledge of writing equivalent expressions. They expand the product of a number (or a variable) and a sum by drawing diagrams and applying the distributive property. Unlike the work in earlier grades, however, some of the resulting expressions are quadratic expressions. The visual and algebraic reasoning here builds toward the next activity, where they will expand expressions containing two sums.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Remind students that multiplying out the factors in an expression like \(5(x + 2)\) and writing it as \(5x+10\) is often called expanding an expression.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p> Applying the distributive property to multiply out the factors of, or expand, \(4(x+2)\) gives us \(4x+8\), so we know the two expressions are equivalent. We can use a rectangle with side lengths \((x+2)\) and 4 to illustrate the multiplication.</p>

<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their responses and diagrams. Make sure that students see how the parts of the diagram correspond to the two equivalent algebraic expressions. Then, highlight that applying the distributive property also allows us to write equivalent expressions without drawing diagrams.</p>
<p>Also remind students that the distributive property can help us write an equivalent expression for a product when a factor has more than two terms. For example, we can draw a rectangle with side lengths \(3x\) and \(2+x+4y\), and then find the areas of the sub-rectangles: \(6x\), \(3x^2\), and \(12xy\). Or we can distribute the multiplication of \(3x\) to each term in the sum, which gives \(6x+3x^2+12xy\).</p>
<p>Tell students that, in the next activity, we will look at how to multiply out (or expand) the factors in an expression when each factor is a sum.</p>
<p>A struggling student could benefit from having algebra tiles to create models, then draw their diagrams from the models.</p>
