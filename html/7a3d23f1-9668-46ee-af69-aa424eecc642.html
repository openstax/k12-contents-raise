<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this warm up, students are prompted to compare function values. To do so, they need to interpret statements in function notation and connect their interpretations to the graph of the function.</p>
<p>Previously, students recognized that if a point with coordinates \((2,20)\) is on the graph of a function, the 2 is an input and the 20 is a corresponding output. Here, they begin to see the second value in a coordinate pair more abstractly, as \(f(2)\) when the input is 2, or as \(f(4)\) when the input is 4.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Give students 1 – 2 minutes of quiet time to think individually. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>
<p>Some students might be unfamiliar with drones. If needed, give a brief explanation of what they are.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>

<p>Here is a graph that represents function \(f\), which gives the height of a drone, in meters, \(t\) seconds after it leaves the ground.</p>
<p><img alt="A line graph shows height (meters) vs. time (seconds). The height rises from 0 to 4 meters between 0-2 seconds, stays at 4 meters until 5 seconds, then drops back to 0 meters by 7 seconds." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/3192aada43883aac8e77e8ee8af08927d79ed818"/></p>
<p>Decide which function value is greater.</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>\(f(0)\) or \(f(4)\)</li>
<ul>
<li>f(0)</li>
<li>f(4)</li>
<li>They are equal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(f(4)\)</p>
<li>Explain your thinking.</li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.  <br/>
    The output value at f(4) is greater than the output value at f(0) because at 4 seconds the drone is 4 meters off the ground while at 0 seconds, the drone is on the ground (0 meters).
    </p>
<li>\(f(2)\) or \(f(5)\)</li>
<ul>
<li>f(2)</li>
<li>f(5)</li>
<li>They are equal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> They are equal.</p>
<li>Explain your thinking.</li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.  <br/>
    The output value at f(2) is equal to the output value at f(5) because at both 2 seconds and 5 seconds, the drone is 4 meters off the ground.
    </p>
<li>\(f(3)\) or \(f(7)\)</li>
<ul>
<li>f(3)</li>
<li>f(7)</li>
<li>They are equal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(f(3)\)</p>
<li>Explain your thinking.</li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.  <br/>
    The output value at f(3) is greater than the output value at f(7) because at 3 seconds the drone is 4 meters off the ground while at 7 seconds, the drone is on the ground (0 meters).
    </p>
<li>\(f(t)\) or \(f(t+1)\)</li>
<ul>
<li>f(t)</li>
<li>f(t+1)</li>
<li>They are equal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> It depends on the value of \(t\).</p>
<li>Explain your thinking.</li>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample.  <br/>
<ul>
<li>It depends on the value of t because during some time periods the values of the function are equal. </li>
<li>It depends on the value of t because between 0-2 seconds, f(t+1) is greater than f(t) but it is exactly the opposite between 5-7 seconds where f(t) is greater. </li>
<li>It depends on the value of t because between 0-2 seconds, f(t+1) is greater, between 2-5 seconds the values are equal, and after 5 seconds, f(t) is greater.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</ol>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share how they compared each pair of outputs. If not mentioned in students’ explanations, point out that for each pair, what we are comparing are the vertical values of the points on the graph at different horizontal values. Even though the statements don’t tell us the values of, say, \(f(3)\) and \(f(7)\), and the vertical axis shows no scale, we can tell from the graph that the function has a greater value when \(t\) is 3 than when \(t\) is 7.</p>
<p>Tell students that the coordinates \((0,f(0))\) represent the starting point of the drone. Ask students, “What are the coordinates of the points when the drone starts leveling off? When it starts to descend? When it lands?” (\((2,f(2))\), \((5,f(5))\), and \((7,f(7))\), respectively.)</p>
<p>Highlight that the coordinates of each point on a graph of a function are \((x,f(x))\).</p>
<p>Discuss with students how they compared \(f(t)\) and \(f(t+1)\) (in the last question). Make sure students see that \(f(t+1)\) could be less than, equal to, or greater than \(f(t)\), depending on the value of \(t\).</p>
<ul>
<li>If \(t\) is 2, then \(t+1\) is 3. From the graph, we can see that \(f(2)\) is equal to \(f(3)\) because the graph has the same vertical value when \(t\) is 2 and 3.</li>
<li>If \(t\) is 5, then \(t+1\) is 6. From the graph, we can see that \(f(5)\) is greater than \(f(6)\) because the graph has a greater vertical value when \(t\) is 5 than when \(t\) is 6.</li>
</ul>
