<h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this warm-up, students are prompted to compare function values. To do so, they need to interpret statements in function notation and connect their interpretations to the graph of the function.</p>
<p>Previously, students recognized that if a point with coordinates \((2,20)\) is on the graph of a function, the 2 is an input and the 20 is a corresponding output. Here, they begin to see the second value in a coordinate pair more abstractly, as \(f(2)\) when the input is 2, or as \(f(4)\) when the input is 4.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Give students 1&ndash;2 minutes of quiet think time. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>
<p>Some students might be unfamiliar with drones. If needed, give a brief explanation of what they are.</p>
<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>
<p><img alt="a drone flying" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/im-ims-export/hUhQJacNNifv2CP2uY3yM5yd" width="250"></p>
<br>
<p>Here is a graph that represents function \(f\), which gives the height of a drone, in meters, \(t\) seconds after it leaves the ground.</p>
<p><img alt="Graph. Horizontal axis, 0 to 8, time, seconds. Vertical axis, height, meters. Starting at 0 comma 0, the graph increases linearly. From 2 to 6, it&rsquo;s horizontal. Then decreases linearly to 7 comma 0." src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/im-ims-export/CPYSCMqBkfN5ka24jDsJDbRJ"></p>
<p>Decide which function value is greater.</p>
<ol>
<li>\(f(0)\) or \(f(4)\)</li>
<li>\(f(2)\) or \(f(5)\)</li>
<li>\(f(3)\) or \(f(7)\)</li>
<li>\(f(t)\) or \(f(t+1)\)</li>
</ol>
<h4>Student Response</h4>
<ol>
<li>\(f(4)\)</li>
<li>They are equal.</li>
<li>\(f(3)\)</li>
<li>It depends on the value of \(t\).</li>
</ol>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share how they compared each pair of outputs. If not mentioned in students&rsquo; explanations, point out that for each pair, what we are comparing are the vertical values of the points on the graph at different horizontal values. Even though the statements don&rsquo;t tell us the values of, say, \(f(3)\) and \(f(7)\), and the vertical axis shows no scale, we can tell from the graph that the function has a greater value when \(t\) is 3 than when \(t\) is 7.</p>
<p>Tell students that the coordinates \((0,f(0))\) represent the starting point of the drone. Ask students, &ldquo;What are the coordinates of the points when the drone starts leveling off? When it starts to descend? When it lands?&rdquo; (\((2,f(2))\), \((5,f(5))\), and \((7,f(7))\), respectively.)</p>
<p>Highlight that the coordinates of each point on a graph of a function are \((x,f(x))\).</p>
<p>Discuss with students how they compared \(f(t)\) and \(f(t+1)\) (in the last question). Make sure students see that \(f(t+1)\) could be less than, equal to, or greater than \(f(t)\), depending on the value of \(t\).</p>
<ul>
<li>If \(t\) is 2, then \(t+1\) is 3. From the graph, we can see that \(f(2)\) is equal to \(f(3)\) because the graph has the same vertical value when \(t\) is 2 and 3.</li>
<li>If \(t\) is 5, then \(t+1\) is 6. From the graph, we can see that \(f(5)\) is greater than \(f(6)\) because the graph has a greater vertical value when \(t\) is 5 than when \(t\) is 6.</li>
</ul>
