    <h4>Extending Your Thinking</h4>
    <p>Another common model for population growth, which fixes some of the improbable predictions of the exponential model, is called a logistic model. A sample function \(f\) of this type is the function \(f(t)=\frac {10}{1+50 \cdot 2^{-t}}\)</p>
<p>Evaluate this function for integer values of \(t\) between 0 and 15. Describe qualitatively how this function differs from an exponential one. What happens to the world population in the long run according to this model?</p>

    <p>Compare your answer:</p>
    <p>We have \(f(0) \approx 0.2\), after which the outputs of \(f\) gradually increase toward 10. Jumping to the end, we find \(f(13) \approx 9.939\), \(f(14) \approx 9.969\), and \(f(15) \approx 9.984\). We can see that the larger that \(t\) gets, the smaller \(2^{-t}\) gets, and so the denominator gets closer to 1, and the overall fraction approaches 10. So according to this model, in the long run, the world population would stabilize at around 10 billion.</p>
