<h4>Lesson Narrative</h4>
<p>By now, students have encountered a variety of situations that can be modeled with quadratic functions. They are also
  familiar with some features of the expressions, tables, and graphs that represent such functions. This lesson
  transitions students from reasoning concretely and contextually about quadratic functions to reasoning about their
  representations in ways that are more abstract and formal.</p>
<p>In earlier grades, students reasoned about multiplication by thinking of the product as the area of a rectangle where
  the two factors being multiplied are the side lengths of the rectangle. In this lesson, students use this familiar
  reasoning to expand expressions such as \((x+4)(x+7)\), where \(x+4\) and \((x+7)\) are side lengths of a rectangle,
  with each side length decomposed into \(x\) and a number. They use the structure in the diagrams to help them write
  equivalent expressions in expanded form: for example, \(x^2+11x+28\). Students recognize that finding the sum of the
  partial areas in the rectangle is the same as applying the distributive property to multiply out the terms in each
  factor.</p>
<p>After this lesson, students move to think more abstractly about such diagrams. Rather than reasoning in terms of
  area, they use the diagrams to organize and account for all terms when applying the distributive property.</p>
<p>The terms "standard form" and "factored form" are not yet used and will be introduced in an upcoming lesson, after
  students have had some experience working with the expressions.</p>
<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>
<p>Students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Use area diagrams to reason about the product of two sums and to write equivalent expressions. </li>
  <li> Use the distributive property to write equivalent quadratic expressions. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Rewrite quadratic expressions in different forms by using an area diagram or the distributive property. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>
<p>Throughout this lesson, activities are incorporated that align to the following ELPS. The suggested activities are only a sampling of the types of support and scaffolding that can extend the learning for English language learners. Continue to find additional opportunities as you build your own set of ELL learning routines.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A2(F) listen to and derive meaning from a variety of media such as audiotape, video, DVD, and CD-ROM to build and reinforce concept and language attainment</li>
  <li>A3(E) share information in cooperative learning interactions</li>
  <li>A5(B) write using newly acquired basic vocabulary and content-based grade-level vocabulary</li>
</ul>
<h4>Support for Building Character</h4>
<p>Throughout this unit, find ways to encourage and support students to work on cultivating their proactivity.</p>
