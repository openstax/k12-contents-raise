<h3>Writing Equations Using Graphs in Situations&nbsp;</h3>
<p>An equation that contains two unknown quantities or two quantities that vary is called an equation in two variables. A solution to such an equation is a pair of numbers that makes the equation true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suppose Tyler spends $45 on T-shirts and socks. A T-shirt costs $10, and a pair of socks costs $2.50. If&nbsp;\( t \) represents the number of T-shirts and&nbsp;\( p \) represents the number of pairs of socks that Tyler buys, what is an equation that represents the situation?</p>
<p>The cost is $10 per T-shirt \(&nbsp;(10t)&nbsp;\) plus $2.50 per pair of socks \(&nbsp;(2.50p)&nbsp;\), which equals $45.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\( 10t +2.50p = 45 \)</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the graph of this equation:&nbsp;</p>

<p>What does the point&nbsp;\( (2, 10) \) mean in this graph in relation to the situation?</p>
<p>Tyler bought 2 T-shirts and 10 pairs of socks for $45.</p>
<p><span>What does the point \( (4, 6) \) mean on this graph?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If Tyler bought 4 T-shirts and 6 pairs of socks, it would cost MORE than $45.</span></p>
<h4>Try It: Writing Equations Using Graphs in Situations&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Use Desmos or a graphing calculator to create a graph for \( 40x +20y = 180 \).&nbsp;</p>
<p>If \(x\) represents the number of pairs of shoes and \(y\) represents the number of pairs of jeans, what is one combination that is a solution, and what does it mean on the graph?</p>

  <p>How did you do? Know that you learn more from wrong answers than from right answers! Wrong answers help us find flaws in our thinking. Take a minute to think about <em>why</em> you got the question wrong. Then you won&rsquo;t get this type of question wrong again!</p>
