<h4>Writing Equations Using Graphs in Situations</h4>
<p>An equation that contains two unknown quantities or two quantities that vary is called an equation in two variables. A solution to such an equation is a pair of numbers that makes the equation true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suppose Tyler spends $40 on T-shirts and socks. A T-shirt costs $10 and a pair of socks costs $2.50. If t represents the number of T-shirts and \(p\) represents the number of pairs of socks that Tyler buys, what is an equation that represents the equation?</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Create a two-variable equation.&nbsp;<br>
  The cost is $10 per t-shirt \((10t)\) plus $2.50 per pair of socks \((2.50p)\) which equals $45.<br>
  \(10t +2.50p = 40\)</p>
<p>Now, we have to graph the equation.&nbsp; We will let \(t=x\) and \(p=y\).</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Find the \(x\)-intercept.<br>
  To find the \(x\)-intercept, let \(p=0\).</p>
<p>\(10t +2.50p = 40\)<br>
  \(10t +2.50(0) = 40\)<br>
  \(10t +0 = 40\)<br>
  \(t = 4\)</p>
<p>\((4, 0)\) is the \(x\)-intercept.<br>
  The \(x\)-intercept is also called a solution or zero.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Find the \(y\)-intercept.<br>
  To find the \(y\)-intercept, let \(t=0\).
<p>\(10t +2.50p = 40\)<br>
  \(10(0) +2.50p = 40\)<br>
  \((0) +2.50p = 40\)<br>
  \(2.50p = 18\)</p>
<p>\((0, 18)\) is the&nbsp; \(y\)-intercept.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Graph the line by connecting the intercepts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the graph of this equation:&nbsp;</p>
