<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Analyze connections between two variables to determine whether or not there is a causal relationship.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <b>activities</b> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>3.6.1: Describing the Relationship between Variables
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you described the relationship between variables using mathematical terminology, such as strong or weak relationship and positive or negative relationship.<br></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>3.6.2: Describing How Two Variables Are Related
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you described how two variables are related and determined whether or not there is a causal relationship. You began to recognize that some variables may be related, but one does not always cause the other to change. You were able to recognize that at this point, the mathematics of scatter plot analysis cannot determine whether there is a causal relationship. You recognized that the relationship must be thought through carefully to decide, based on the situation, whether the related variables have a causal relationship.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>3.6.2: Self Check</li>
  <li>3.6.3: Using the Term Causal Relationship
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you practiced using the term causal relationship and thought of situations to which it might apply and whether relationships were causal.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>3.6.3: Self Check</li>
  <li>3.6.4:Determining the Type of Relationship
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you decided if variable pairs had a very weak or no relationship, a strong relationship that is not a causal relationship, or a causal relationship.<br></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <b>practice</b>:</p>
