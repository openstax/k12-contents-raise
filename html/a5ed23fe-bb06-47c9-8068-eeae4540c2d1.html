<p>Cash kicked a football off a tee. The path of the football is shown below and represented by the function \(f(x)=-0 .02(x-h)^2+k\), where \(x\) represents the horizontal distance and \(f(x)\) represents the height.</p>
<p><img alt="Graph of a parabola on a coordinate plane. The x-axis represents the horizontal distance in feet and has a scale of 1 extending from 0 to approximately 36. The vertical-axis represents the height of the football in feet and extends from 0 to 10 with a scale of 1." height="265" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/5f2a84ba5ea778acd94a20c4e1a5d81f7d8d5f46" width="300"/></p>
