<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>In the warm-up of this lesson, students saw a visual representation of two equations being added to form a third equation. Because the first two equations are balanced, the third is also balanced. In this activity, students continue to develop the idea of adding two equations to form a third equation and use it to help them solve systems of linear equations.</p>
<p>Along the way, students examine the work of others and practice explaining their reasoning and critiquing that of others. They also see that sometimes adding equations is a productive way to solve systems, but other times it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Give students 2 minutes of quiet time to think about the first set of questions and then time to share their thinking with their partner. Follow with a whole-class discussion before students proceed to the second set of questions.</p>
<p>Invite students to share their analysis of Diego&rsquo;s work: what Diego has done to solve the system and why he might have done it that way. Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;In this case, what happens when the equations are added? Why might it be helpful to do so?&rdquo; (The expressions with  add up to 0, so it&rsquo;s removed from the equation, making it possible to solve for \( y \).)&ldquo;How does finding the value of \( y \) help with solving the system?&rdquo; (Once we know the value of one variable, we can use it to find the value of the other by substituting it back into one of the equations and solving that equation.)</li>
  <li>&ldquo;How can we be sure that \( x=1 \) and \( y=2 \) simultaneously makes both equations true and is a solution to the system?&rdquo; (We can substitute those values into the equations and see if the equations are true. We can also graph the system and see if it intersects at \( (1,2) \).)</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, ask students to complete the remainder of the activity.</p>

  <p><em>Representation: Internalize Comprehension. </em>Begin the activity with concrete or familiar contexts: Explicitly link the warm-up to the representation involved in analyzing Diego&rsquo;s work. Connect the intuitive understanding of balance to familiar mathematical statements that do not require solving. Present strategically, in the same format as Diego&rsquo;s work. For instance, ask students if \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) is a true and balanced statement. Then, ask them if \( 3 + 1 = 4 \) is also a true and balanced statement. Once students have labeled these as true, add them together in the same arrangement as the upcoming problems and ask students if the result, \( (5 + 3 = 8) \), will therefore also be true and balanced. Then, introduce Diego&rsquo;s work.</p>

<h3>Student Activity</h3>

<p>Make sense of Diego&rsquo;s work and discuss with a partner, then answer questions 1 - 3.</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" >
  <li>
    What did Diego do to solve the system?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Compare your answer: Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. Diego added the two equations, and the sum is an equation with only one variable, \(y\), which can be solved. He then substituted the \(y\)-value into the first equation and solved for \(x\).</p>

<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>
    Is the pair of \(x\)- and \(y\)-values that Diego found actually a solution to the system?&nbsp;
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes</p>

<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>
    How do you know?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> When the values are substituted back to the equations in the system, they make the equations true.</p>


<p>For questions 4–7 determine if Diego&rsquo;s method will work for solving the system. Be prepared to show your reasoning. If Diego&rsquo;s method does not work, use a different method to solve and get the answers.</p>

<p>\(\left\{\begin{array}{l}\begin{array}{rcl}2x+y&amp;=&amp;4\\x-y&amp;=&amp;11\end{array}\end{array}\right.\)</p>

<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li>
    Will Diego&rsquo;s method work for solving the system?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes</p>

<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="5">
  <li>
    What is the \(x\) value?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 5</p>

<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="6">
  <li>
    What is the \(y\) value?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> -6</p>

<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="7">
  <li>
    Explain your solutions.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. Adding the two equations gives \(3x=15\), or \(x=5\). Substituting 5 for \(x\) in either one of the original equations gives  \(y=−6\).</p>

<p>For questions 8–11 determine if Diego&rsquo;s method will work for solving the system. Be prepared to show your reasoning. If Diego&rsquo;s method does not work, use a different method to solve and get the answers.</p>

<p>\(\left\{\begin{array}{lc}\begin{array}{rcl}8x+11y&amp;=&amp;37\;\;\\8x+y&amp;=&amp;7\end{array}\end{array}\right.\)</p>

<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="8">
  <li>
    Will Diego&rsquo;s method work for solving the system?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> No</p>

<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="9">
  <li>
    What is the \(x\) value?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p> \(x=\frac12 \)</p>

<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="10">
  <li>
    What is the \(y\) value?
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 3</p>

<ol  class="os-raise-noindent" start="11">
  <li>
    Explain your solutions.
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. Diego&rsquo;s method does not work because adding the two equations doesn&rsquo;t get us anywhere. The sum is \(16x+12y=44\), which doesn&rsquo;t make it easier to solve.</p>

<p>It works if the second equation is subtracted from the first instead of added to the first. The difference is \(10y=30\), or \(y=3\). If we substitute 3 for \(y\) in one of the original equations, we get \(x=\frac12\).</p>

<br>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite students to share their responses to the last set of questions and discuss whether Diego&rsquo;s method works for solving the two systems. Ask students:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Why does adding the equations work for solving the system with \( 2x + y =4 \) and \( x-y=11 \) but doesn&rsquo;t work for \( 8x + 11y = 37 \) and \( 8x + y =7 \)?&rdquo;
    <ul>
      <li>In the resulting equation, there are still two variables whose values we don&rsquo;t know.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>&ldquo;What if we subtract the equations? Would that help us solve the last system?&rdquo;
    <ul>
      <li>Yes, subtracting the second equation from the first gives \(10y = 30\) or \(y = 3\), which we can then use to find the \(x\)-value.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>&ldquo;How is adding the two equations here like and unlike combining the shapes in the two hanger diagrams earlier? How is it different?&rdquo;
    <ul>
      <li>It is similar in that the result is another equation with the combined parts on the left side staying on the left and the combined parts on the right staying on the right. It is different since the hanger diagrams in these equations use numbers and variables, and one of the parts on the left adds up to 0 and disappears from the third equation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure students see that if we choose to add or subtract strategically, in each of the new equations one variable is eliminated, making it possible to solve for the other variable. When the value of that variable is substituted in either of the original equations, we can solve for the variable that was eliminated. Tell students that this method of solving a system is called solving by elimination.<br>
</p>
<p>Point out that there is nothing wrong about adding the equations in the last system. It simply doesn&rsquo;t get us anywhere closer to the solution and is therefore unproductive.</p>

<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>
<p>Use this routine to help students improve their writing by providing them with multiple opportunities to clarify their explanations through conversation. Give students time to meet with 1&ndash;2 partners to share their response to the final question about Diego&rsquo;s method. Provide listeners with prompts for feedback that will help their partner add detail to strengthen and clarify their ideas. For example, students can ask their partner: &ldquo;How did you use Diego&rsquo;s method to solve this problem?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Can you say more about . . .?&rdquo; Give students 2&ndash;3 minutes to revise their initial draft based on feedback from their peers. This will help students produce a written generalization for how they can determine whether adding equations is a useful strategy for solving a linear system.</p>

<h4>The Elimination Method of Solving Systems of Equations</h4>
<p>The Elimination Method is based on the Addition Property of Equality. The Addition Property of Equality says that when you add the same quantity to both sides of an equation, you still have equality. We will extend the Addition Property of Equality to say that when you add equal quantities to both sides of an equation, the results are equal.</p>
<p>For any expressions \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\):</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}\text{if }\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;a\;&amp;=&amp;\;b\;\\\text{and}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;c\;&amp;=&amp;\;d\;\\\text{then}\;\;\;a\;+\;c\;&amp;=&amp;\;b\;+\;d.\;\end{array}\)</p>
<p>To solve a system of equations by elimination, we start with both equations in standard form. Then we decide which variable will be easiest to eliminate. How do we decide? We want to have the coefficients of one variable be opposites so that we can add the equations together and eliminate that variable</p>
<p>Notice how that works when we add these two equations together:</p>
<p> \(\underline{\left\{\begin{array}{l}3\;x\;+\;y\;=\;5\;\\2\;x\;-\;y\;=\;0\end{array}\right.}\\\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;5x=5\)</p>
<br>
<p>The \(y\)&rsquo;s add to zero, and we have one equation with one variable.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try another one:</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}\left\{\begin{array}{c}4p\;-\;2s\;&amp;=&amp;\;-26\\-5p\;+\;2s\;&amp;=&amp;\;29\end{array}\right.\end{array}\)</p>
<p> <strong>We can add the equations, so \(s\) will be eliminated when we add these two equations.</strong></p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{l}\underline{\left\{\begin{array}{ccc}4p\;-\;2s\;&amp;=&amp;\;-26\\-5p\;+\;2s\;&amp;=&amp;\;29\end{array}\right.}\\\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;-p\;=\;3\\\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;p\;=-3\end{array}\)</p>
<br>
<p> Once we get an equation with just one variable, we solve it. Then we substitute that value into one of the original equations to solve for the remaining variable. And, as always, we check our answer to make sure it is a solution to both of the original equations.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Solve the system by elimination:</p>
<p>\(\begin{array}{l}\left\{\begin{array}{c}4\;x\;+\;8\;y\;&amp;=&amp;\;12\\4x-5y&amp;=&amp;38\end{array}\right.\end{array}\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Write both equations in standard form. If any coefficients are fractions, clear them.<br>
  \( 4x + 8y = 12 \)
    <br>
  \( 4x - 5y = 38 \) </p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Check to see if the coefficients of one variable are opposites or equivalent.<br>
  The coefficients on the \(x\)-variables are equivalent. We can subtract the equations. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Subtract the equations to eliminate one variable. <br>
  \(\begin{array}{l}\underline{4\;x\;+\;8\;y\;=\;12\\\;\;4\;x\;–\;5\;y\;=\;38}\\\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;13\;y\;=\;–\;26\end{array}\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Solve for the remaining variable. <br>
  \(\begin{array}{rcl}13y\;&amp;=&amp;\;&ndash;26\\y\;&amp;=&amp;\;&ndash;2\end{array}\) </p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Substitute the solution from Step 4 into one of the original equations. Then solve for the other variable.<br>
  \(\begin{array}{rcl}4x\;+\;8y\;&amp;=&amp;\;12\\4x\;+\;8{\style{color:red}(}{\style{color:red}&ndash;}{\style{color:red}2}{\style{color:red})}\;&amp;=&amp;\;12\\4x\;&ndash;\;16\;&amp;=&amp;\;12\\4x\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;&amp;=&amp;\;28\\x\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;&amp;=&amp;\;7\end{array}\) </p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Write the solution as an ordered pair.<br>
  \( (7, -2)\) </p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Check that the ordered pair is a solution to both original equations. </p>

<h3>Try It: The Elimination Method of Solving Systems of Equations</h3>
<br>
<p>Solve the system by elimination:</p>
<p>\(\left\{\begin{array}{c}3x\;+y\;&amp;=&amp;\;5\\-3x\;-\;7y\;&amp;=&amp;1\end{array}\right.\)</p>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p> Here is how to solve the system by elimination:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Write both equations in standard form. <br>
  \( \begin{array}{rcl}3x + y &amp;=&amp; 5\\ -3x - 7y &amp;=&amp; 1\end{array} \) </p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Check to see if the coefficients of one variable are opposites or equivalent. <br>
  <strong>The coefficients on the \(x\)-variables are opposites. We can add the equations.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Add the equations resulting from Step 2 to eliminate one variable. <br>
  \( \begin{array}{rcl}3x + y &amp;=&amp; 5\\ -3x - 7y &amp;=&amp; 1\\ -6y &amp;=&amp; 6\end{array} \) </p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Solve for the remaining variable. <br>
  \( y = -1 \) </p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> - Substitute the solution from Step 4 into one of the original equations. Then solve for the other variable. <br>

  \( \begin{array}{rcl}3x + y &amp;=&amp; 5 \\ 3x + {\style{color:red}(}{\style{color:red}–}{\style{color:red}1}{\style{color:red})} &amp;=&amp; 5\\ 3x - 1 &amp;=&amp; 5\\ x &amp;=&amp; 2\end{array} \)</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong> - Write the solution as an ordered pair. <br>
  \((2, -1)\) </p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong> - Check that the ordered pair is a solution to both original equations.</p>
