<p>To help students consolidate and articulate the ideas from this lesson, ask questions such as:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li>
<p>"Suppose we graph the equation \(y=-2(x&minus;7)^2+5\). What is the vertex of the graph?" \((7,5)\)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"What are some ways to tell if the vertex is the maximum or the minimum point on the graph?" (Some explanations:</p>
</li>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
<li>
<p>The squared term \((x&minus;7)^2\) has a negative coefficient. We saw earlier that when that coefficient is negative the graph opens down, so the vertex is the maximum point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When \(x=7\), the \(y\)-value is 5. When \(x\) is greater than 7, \(y\) is less than 5. When \(x\) is less than 7, \(y\) is also less than 5. This means that the points on either side of the vertex have smaller \(y\)-values, so the vertex is the maximum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When \(x\) is 7, \((x&minus;7)^2\) is 0. Multiplying it by -2 gives 0. When \(x\) is other than 7, \((x&minus;7)^2\) is a positive number. Multiplying it by -2 gives a negative number, so it is less than 0.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p>"How can we verify that 5 is the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex?" (Evaluating the function at x=7 gives \(-2(7&minus;7)^2+5=0+5=5\).)</p>
</li>
<li>"Does knowing the location of the vertex and whether the graph opens up or down enough for sketching the graph to represent \(y=-2(x&minus;7)^2+5\)? If not, what else is needed?" (We still don't know how "wide" or "narrow" the opening of the graph will be, so it helps to know another point on the graph. To find another point, we can choose an \(x\)-value and find the corresponding \(y\)-value. We can use that point to quickly find one more point with the same \(y\)-coordinate because the graph is symmetric across the vertex.)</li></ul>
