<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Describe how changing a number in the vertex form of a quadratic function affects its graph. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li> 7.17.1: Quadratic Expressions in Different Forms </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you matched graphs with their equations by comparing values. </li>
</ul>
<li> 7.17.2: Modify Expressions to Translate Graphs </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you shifted graphs by changing the vertex and writing the correct vertex form given the vertex and the direction of the parabola opening. </li>
<li> 7.17.2: Self Check </li>
<li> 7.17.2: Additional Resources </li>
</ul>
<li> 7.17.3: Changing the Parameters of a Quadratic Expression </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you changed parameters that found the equation needed to represent the context given. You found the equation of the parabola that modeled the path a peanut needed to take to jump over the wall in a simulation. </li>
<li> 7.17.3: Self Check </li>
<li> 7.17.3: Additional Resources </li>
</ul>
<li> 7.17.4: Transforming the Parent Function </li>
<ul>
<li> In this optional activity, you were given pieces of parabolas and worked to find the equation of each piece and justify your reasoning. </li>
</ul>
<li> 7.17.5: Equations of Graph Translations </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you looked at both graphs and equations and declared the translations that were made from the parent function \(f(x)=x^2\) to the new equation. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following<strong> practice:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> 7.17.6: Practice </li>
