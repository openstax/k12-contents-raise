<p>In this lesson, you will revisit the fact that exponential functions grow more quickly, eventually, than linear functions. You will examine tables and graphs and see that the exponential function quickly overtakes the linear function.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li> Use tables, calculations, and graphs to compare growth rates of linear and exponential functions and predict how the quantities eventually change. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the<strong> activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 5.14.1: Distinguish Linear and Exponential Growth </li>
  <li> 5.14.2: Using Tables to Compare Linear and Exponential Growth Functions <ul>
      <li> 5.14.2: Self Check&nbsp; </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> 5.14.3: Compare Linear Functions with Exponential Functions&nbsp; <ul>
      <li> 5.14.3: Self Check&nbsp; </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> 5.14.4: Using Function Notation to Compare Linear and Exponential Functions </li>
</ul>
<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll<strong> practice and review</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li> 5.14.5: Practice </li>
  <li> 5.14.6: Lesson Summary </li>
