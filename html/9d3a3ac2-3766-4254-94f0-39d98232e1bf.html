      <div class="editor-indent">Equation 1: \(B = 3.28W +126 \)</div>
      <div class="editor-indent">Equation 2: \(B = 3.04W +351 \)</div>
      <div class="editor-indent">Equation 3: \(B = 2.16W +267 \)<br><br></div>
      <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong></p>
      <p>Line 1 and Equation 3 match because the intercept of 267 appears to match the graph, which has the second-largest intercept.</p>
      <p>Line 2 and Equation 2 match because the intercept of Equation 2 is larger, so it matches Line 2, which has a \(y\)-intercept closer to 400.</p>
      <p>Line 3 and Equation 1 match because the intercept of Equation 1 is the smallest, which seems to match the graph.</p>
