  <p>The best fit
line is given by the equation \(y=0.404x&minus;5.18\), where \(y\) represents the height of the plant above ground
level, and \(x\) represents the number of days since it was planted.
<p>What is the slope of the best fit line? What does the slope of the line mean in this situation?&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
<li>The slope is 5.18, which means for every day, the plant grows 5.18 centimeters</li>
<li>The slope is 0.404, which means for every day, the plant grows 0.404 centimeters</li>
<li>The slope is \(-5.18\), which means for every day, the plant shrinks 5.18 centimeters</li>
<li>The slope is 0.404, which means the plant grows 1 centimeter every 0.404 days.</li>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Line 2 and Equation 2 match because the intercept of Equation 2 is larger, so it matches Line 2, which has a
\(y\)-intercept closer to 400.</p>

<p>Which of the following equations is a linear model representing the number of yards, \(Y\), Mike can cut in \(d\) days.</p>
<ul>
  <li>\( Y = 6d \)</li>
  <li>\( Y=6d + 6 \)</li>
  <li>\( Y= \frac16 d\)&nbsp; </li>
  <li>\( Y= \frac16 d +6 \)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \(Y =6d\)</p>
<p>Since the change in \(y\) is 6 and change in \(x\) is 1, the slope is 6. Working backwards, when \(d = 0\), \(Y=0\) so the equation becomes \(Y=6x+0\) or \(Y = 6d\).</p>
