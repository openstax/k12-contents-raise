  <p>Use graphing technology to create a scatter plot and find the best fit line.<br>What does the best fit
    line estimate for the \(y\)-value when \(x\) is 100?</p>

      <p>The best fit
    line is given by the equation \(y=0.404x&minus;5.18\), where \(y\) represents the height of the plant above ground
    level, and \(x\) represents the number of days since it was planted.
<p>What is the slope of the best fit line? What does the slope of the line mean in this situation?&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
    <li>The slope is 5.18, which means for every day, the plant grows 5.18 centimeters</li>
    <li>The slope is 0.404, which means for every day, the plant grows 0.404 centimeters</li>
    <li>The slope is \(-5.18\), which means for every day, the plant shrinks 5.18 centimeters</li>
    <li>The slope is 0.404, which means the plant grows 1 centimeter every 0.404 days.</li>

<p><strong>Answer: </strong>b</p>
<p>3. The scatter plots below show different lines that students used to model the relationship between body mass (in
  pounds) and bite force (in pounds) for crocodiles.</p>
<p>Match each graph to one of the equations below, and explain your reasoning. Let \(B\) represent bite force (in
  pounds) and \(W\) represent body mass (in pounds).</p>

<p>Equation 1: \(B = 3.28W +126 \)</p>
<p>Equation 2: \(B = 3.04W +351 \)</p>
<p>Equation 3: \(B = 2.16W +267 \)</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Answer:</p>
<p>Line 1 and Equation 3 match because the intercept of 267 appears to match the graph, which has the second-largest
  intercept.</p>
<p>Line 2 and Equation 2 match because the intercept of Equation 2 is larger, so it matches Line 2, which has a
  \(y\)-intercept closer to 400.</p>
<p>Line 3 and Equation 1 match because the intercept of Equation 1 is the smallest, which seems to match the graph.</p>
