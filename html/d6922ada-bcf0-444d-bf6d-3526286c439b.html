    <p>Your teacher will give your group a set of cards. Each card contains a graph or an equation.</p>
    <ul class="os-raise-noindent">
      <li> Take turns with your partner to sort the cards into sets so that each set contains two equations and a graph that all represent the same quadratic function. </li>
      <li> For each set of cards that you put together, explain to your partner how you know they belong together. </li>
      <li> For each set that your partner puts together, listen carefully to their explanation. If you disagree, discuss your thinking and work to reach an agreement. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once all the cards are sorted and discussed, record the equivalent equations, sketch the corresponding graph, and write a brief note or explanation about why the representations were grouped together.</p>
