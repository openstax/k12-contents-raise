<p>As you proceed through this section, you will learn how systems of equations can be used to find unknown quantities and solve problems.</p>
<p>This section includes 6 lessons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Writing and Graphing Systems of Linear Equations </li>
  <li>Solving Systems by Substitution</li>
  <li>Solving Systems by Elimination, Part 1</li>
  <li>Solving Systems by Elimination, Part 2</li>
  <li>Solving Systems by Elimination, Part 3</li>
  <li>Systems of Linear Equations and Their Solutions</li>
</ul>

<p>This Section Overview Video provides a closer look at the individual lessons within this section, and provides teachers with pacing and instructional suggestions for successful classroom implementation. </p><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ivM9wIWahBU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
