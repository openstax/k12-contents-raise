<h4>Average Rate of Change from a Table</h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an exponential function we studied earlier. Let \(A(t)\) be the function that models the area \(A\), in square yards, of algae covering a pond \(t\) weeks after beginning treatment to control the algae bloom. Here is a table showing approximately how many square yards of algae remain during the first 5 weeks of treatment.</p>
<table class="os-raise-skinnytable">

    <tr>

<p>The average rate of change of \(A\) from the start of treatment to week 2 is about &ndash;107 square yards per week since \(\frac{A(2)-A(0)}{2-0} \approx -107\). The average rate of change of \(A\) from week 2 to week 4, however, is only about &ndash;12 square yards per week since \(\frac{A(4)-A(2)}{4-2} \approx -12\).</p>
