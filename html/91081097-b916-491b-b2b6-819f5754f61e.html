<p>In this lesson, you
  will continue to develop your understanding of
  solving systems by elimination. You will be given a system that represents the
  quantities and constraints in a situation and learn to interpret, in context,
  the solutions to the individual equations and to the system. Ultimately, the
  context will be used to make sense of the sum of the two equations and why it
  shares a solution with the equations in the given system. </p>
<p>When you finish
  this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explain why
    adding or subtracting two equations that share a solution results in a new
    equation that also shares the same solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <b>activities</b> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
