<p><span lang="EN">In this lesson, you
    will continue to develop your understanding of
    solving systems by elimination. You will be given a system that represents the
    quantities and constraints in a situation and learn to interpret, in context,
    the solutions to the individual equations and to the system. Ultimately, the
    context will be used to make sense of the sum of the two equations and why it
    shares a solution with the equations in the given system. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">When you finish
    this lesson, you will be able to:</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span lang="EN">Explain why
      adding or subtracting two equations that share a solution results in a new
      equation that also shares the same solution.</span></li>
</ul>
