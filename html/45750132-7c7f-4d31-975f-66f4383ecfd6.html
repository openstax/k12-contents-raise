<p>Invite students to reflect on the process of completing the square for various kinds of equations. Display equations such as the following and ask students which ones would be fairly easy to solve by completing the square, which ones would not be, and why.</p>
<p>\(x^2+8x=-12\)</p>
<p>\(16x^2+8x=-12\)</p>
<p>\(4x^2+32x=-7\)</p>
<p>\(5x^2+32x=-7\)</p>
<p>\(9x^2+3x&minus;6=0\)</p>
<p>Discuss questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> "What number would you add to \(4x^2+32x\) (the third equation on the list) to make it a perfect square? How do you know?" (64. The coefficient 32 is equal to \(2(2)m\), so \(m\) is 8. The number to be added is 82, which is 64.) </li>
  <li> "What about \(9x^2+6x\)? How do you know?" (1. The coefficient 6 is equal to \(2(3)m\), so \(m\) is 1. The number to be added is 12, which is 1.) </li>
  <li> "Do certain features or numbers in an equation make it easier or harder to solve it by completing the square? If so, which features or what kinds of numbers?" (It's easier when the coefficient of the squared term is 1 or another perfect square. It's harder when some of the coefficients are fractions or the quadratic term's coefficient is not a perfect square.) </li>
</ul>
