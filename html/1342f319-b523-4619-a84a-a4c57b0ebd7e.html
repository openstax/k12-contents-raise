<li>The function \(f\) is defined by \(f(x)=2^x\). Which of the following statements is true about the values of
    \(f\)? Select all that apply.  </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li> When the input \(x\) increases by 1, the value of \(f\) increases by 2.</li>
<li>When the input \(x\) increases by 1, the value of \(f\) increases by a factor of 2.</li>
<li>When the input \(x\) increases by 3, the value of \(f\) increases by 8.</li>

<li> When the input \(x\)increases by 4, the value of \(f\) increases by a factor of 4.</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Answer: </strong> When the input \(x\) increases by 1, the value of \(f\) increases by a factor of 2 and d:

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
<li>Use the graph to explain why the value of \(f\) increases by 2 each time the input \(x\) increases by 1. 
  </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li> The \(y\)-axis counts by 2’s so f must increase 2 each time the input increases 1. </li>
<li> There are two graphs so \(f\) increases by 2 each time the input \(x\) increases by 1. </li>
<li> (0,0) and (1,2) are two points on the graph of \(f\). Between the two points, \(y\) increases by 2 and \(x\)
    increases by 1. </li>
<li> \(f\)does not increase by 2 each time \(x\) increases by 1. </li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Answer: </strong> (0,0) and (1,2) are two points on the graph of \(f\). Between the two points, \(y\)
  increases by 2 and \(x\) increases by 1. </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
<li>Use the graph to explain why the value of \(g\) increases by 2 each time the input \(x\) increases by 1. Select
    all that apply. </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li> \(f\) and \(g\) never intersect and stay an equal distance apart. \(f\)<em> </em>increases by 2
    every time \(x\) increases by 1, so \(g\)  must do so as well. </li>
<li> You can’t use the graph because the points are not labeled </li>
<li> There are two graphs so \(g\) increases by 2 each time the input \(x\) increases by 1. </li>
<li> (0,5) and (1,7) are points on the graph of \(g\)<em>.</em>  Between the two points, \(y\) increases by 2
    and \(x\) increases by 1. </li>
<li> (0,0) and (1,2) are two points on the graph of \(g\)<em>. </em> Between the two points,
    \(y\) increases by 2 and \(x\) increases by 1 </li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong> \(f\) and \(g\) never intersect and stay an equal distance apart. \(f\) increases by 2
  every time \(x\) increases by 1, so \(g\) has to also. And d. (0,5) and (1,7) are points on the graph of \(g\). 
  Between the two points, \(y\) increases by 2 and \(x\) increases by 1.</p>
