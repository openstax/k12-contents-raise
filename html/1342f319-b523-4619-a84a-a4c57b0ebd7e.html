      <li> When the input \(x\)&nbsp;increases by 1, the value of \(f\) increases by 2.</li>
      <li>When the input&nbsp;\(x\)&nbsp;increases by 1, the value of \(f\) increases by a factor of 2.</li>
      <li>When the input \(x\)&nbsp;increases by 3, the value of \(f\) increases by 8.</li>
      <li> When the input&nbsp;\(x\)&nbsp;increases by 3, the value of \(f\) increases by a factor of 8.</li>

<ol start="3">
  <li>Use the graph to explain why the value of \(f\) increases by 2 each time the input \(x\) increases by 1.&nbsp;
    <ol type="a">
      <li> The \(y\)-axis counts by 2&rsquo;s so f must increase 2 each time the input increases 1. </li>
      <li> There are two graphs so \(f\) increases by 2 each time the input \(x\) increases by 1. </li>
      <li> (0,0) and (1,2) are two points on the graph of \(f\). Between the two points, \(y\) increases by 2 and \(x\) increases by 1. </li>
      <li> \(f\)does not increase by 2 each time \(x\) increases by 1. </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p> <strong>ANSWER: </strong>c. (0,0) and (1,2) are two points on the graph of \(f\). Between the two points, \(y\) increases by 2 and \(x\) increases by 1. </p>

  <li>Use the graph to explain why the value of \(g\) increases by 2 each time the input \(x\) increases by 1. Select all that apply.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>&nbsp;\(f\) and \(g\) never intersect and stay an equal distance apart.&nbsp;\(f\)<em>&nbsp;</em>increases by 2 every time \(x\) increases by 1, so \(g\)&nbsp;<em></em>must do so as well. </li>
      <li> You can&rsquo;t use the graph because the points are not labeled </li>
      <li> There are two graphs so \(g\) increases by 2 each time the input&nbsp;\(x\)&nbsp;increases by 1. </li>
      <li> (0,5) and (1,7) are points on the graph of \(g\)<em>.</em>&nbsp; Between the two points, \(y\) increases by 2 and&nbsp;\(x\)&nbsp;increases by 1. </li>
      <li> (0,0) and (1,2) are two points on the graph of&nbsp;\(g\)<em>.&nbsp;</em> Between the two points, \(y\)&nbsp;increases by 2 and \(x\) increases by 1 </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <strong>ANSWER: </strong>a. \(f\) and \(g\) never intersect and stay an equal distance apart. \(f\) increases by 2 every time \(x\) increases by 1, so \(g\) has to also. And d. (0,5) and (1,7) are points on the graph of \(g\).&nbsp; Between the two points, \(y\) increases by 2 and \(x\) increases by 1.
