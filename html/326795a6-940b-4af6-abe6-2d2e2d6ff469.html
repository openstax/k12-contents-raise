<p>Marcus is going to the library with his friend Monica.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Monica lives between the library and Marcus&rsquo;s house.
  </li>
  <li>
    Marcus lives 0.5 mile from Monica, and she lives 0.25 mile from the library.
  </li>
  <li>
    Marcus walks to Monica&rsquo;s house in 5 minutes, and he stays there for 15 minutes before they walk together to the library in 3 minutes.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If you were sketching a graph of Marcus&rsquo;s distance from home in miles with respect to time, in minutes, how would you represent the 15 minutes he was at Monica&rsquo;s house graphically?</p>
