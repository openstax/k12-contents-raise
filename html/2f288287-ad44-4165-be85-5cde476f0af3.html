<p>To help students consolidate and articulate their understanding of the relationship between \((x + m)(x &minus; m)\) and \(x^2&minus; m^2\), ask them to reflect, in writing or by talking to a partner, on questions such as:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>&ldquo;The expression \((x + 4)(x &minus; 4)\) has a sum and a difference, and so does \((x + 8)(x &minus; 2)\). When expanded into standard form, why does one have a linear term but the other does not?&rdquo; (Multiplying out \((x + 4)(x &minus; 4)\) gives two linear terms that are opposites, \(4x\) and \(-4x\), which add up to 0, so the linear term disappears. Multiplying out \((x + 8)(x &minus; 2)\) also gives two linear terms, \(8x\) and \(-2x\). Because they are not opposites, their sum is not 0, so the linear term remains.) </li>
<li>&ldquo;Can \(\frac {1}{4} &minus; 100m^2\) be seen as a difference of two squares? Can it be written in factored form? If so, what would it be?&rdquo; (Yes. \(\frac {1}{2}\) squared is \(\frac {1}{4}\), and \((10m)^2\) is \(100m^2\). The factored form is \((\frac {1}{2} + 10m)(\frac {1}{2} &minus; 10m)\)). </li>
<li>&ldquo;Think of another example of a quadratic expression in factored form that, when rewritten in standard form, is a difference of two squares and does not have a linear term. What is the expression in standard form?&rdquo; (Answers may vary. For example, factored form: \((2x+9)(2x-9)\); standard form: \(4x^2 - 81\).) </li>
</ul>
