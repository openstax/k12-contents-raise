<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> Complete the square for quadratic expressions of the form \(ax^2+bx+c\) when \(a\) is not 1 and explain the process. </li>
  <li> Solve quadratic equations in which the squared term coefficient is not 1 by completing the square. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> 9.4.1: Perfect Squares with Coefficients Other than 1 </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you found the error when completing the square when the leading coefficient is not 1. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 9.4.2: Rewrite Squared Expressions </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you determined if a quadratic expression was a perfect square. If it was not a perfect square, you made a suggestion that could make the expression a perfect square. </li>
    <li> 9.4.2: Self Check </li>
    <li> 9.4.2: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 9.4.3: Standard Form and Squared Factors </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you found the value of \(c\) to complete the square of the quadratic then wrote the quadratic in factored form. </li>
    <li> 9.4.3: Self Check </li>
    <li> 9.4.3: Additional Resources </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 9.4.4: Three Different Methods for Solving an Equation </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this optional activity, you explored three different methods for solving quadratic equations then used each method to solve an equation. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> 9.4.5: Perfect Square and Squared Factors </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In this activity, you completed the square then solved the quadratic equation. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> 9.4.6: Practice </li>
