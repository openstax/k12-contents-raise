<p>A key takeaway from this lesson is the idea that quadratic functions can be written in a variety of equivalent forms.</p>
<p>Ask students to summarize how to go from:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Vertex to standard form. </li>
  <li> Factored to standard form. </li>
  <li> Standard to vertex form. </li>
</ul>
<p>Then discuss as a class what information each form can easily provide. Also review how to write a quadratic equation in vertex form from a vertex and a point. Ask students to reflect on steps that could cause mistakes, such as substituting a point in for the wrong values, or not balancing the equation when completing the square.</p>
<p>Tell students that expressions, equations, and inequalities are mathematical models. A model is a mathematical representation of a real-life situation. When people create models, they rely on the information they have, but they also make assumptions and decisions that affect the models. If the information or assumptions change, the model would also change.</p>
