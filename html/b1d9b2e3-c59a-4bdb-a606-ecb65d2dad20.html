<h4>Dividing Polynomials Using Long Division</h4>
<p>To divide a polynomial by a binomial, we follow a procedure very similar to long division of numbers. So let’s look carefully at the steps we take when we divide a \(3\)-digit number, \(875\), by a \(2\)-digit number, \(25\).</p>
<p><img alt="Long division setup: 875 is under the division bar labeled as dividend, and 25 is outside the division bar labeled as divisor, both labels in red with arrows pointing to the numbers." height="34" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/68e3a4fec0f507563873765a4fe4ee171c2c30e9" width="350"/></p>
<p><strong>Step 1 - </strong>Starting from the leftmost digit in the dividend and moving right one digit at a time, find the smallest value possible that is larger than the divisor.</p>
<p><strong>Divide </strong>this value, \(87\), by the divisor, \(25\). Write the whole-number result with no remainder in the space for the quotient.</p>
<p><img alt="Long division setup: 875 divided by 25, with the 8 in 875 underlined and a red 3 written above the 8." height="63" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/6d560526b876d277111b2e64beb88e7c1e8fe79b" width="100"/> </p>
<p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> <strong>Multiply</strong> this digit in the quotient by the divisor, \(3 \cdot 25\). </p>
<p>Write the result below the corresponding digits in the dividend.</p>
<p><img alt="A long division problem: 875 divided by 25. The divisor is 25, the dividend is 875, the quotient is 3, and the number 75 is written in red below the dividend." height="80" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/2424aa7c0cb5bbe104d266fb3a46fb8378005464" width="112"/> </p>
<p><strong>Step 3 -</strong> <strong>Subtract</strong> the two values.</p>
<p><img alt="Long division problem: 875 divided by 25. The 25 goes into 87 three times, noted above the division bar. Multiplication and subtraction work is shown underneath, leaving a remainder of 12." height="102" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/e79e0186961e84a73a14b91343ad3660411c6026" width="112"/> </p>
<p><strong>Step 4 -  Bring down</strong> the next digit in the dividend.</p>
<p><img alt="Long division problem: 875 divided by 25. The 25 goes into 87 three times, noted above the division bar. Multiplication and subtraction work is shown underneath, leaving a remainder of 12.  The 5 is underlined in red and brought down next to the 12.  That 5 is also underlined in red." height="102" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b9ca5b6670206d68848ee6faa18cde874d62a148" width="112"/> </p>
<p> <strong>Step 5 - </strong>Repeat the division by dividing the new value, \(125\), by the divisor. </p>
<p>Write the result, \(5\), over the corresponding digit in the quotient.</p>
<p><img alt="Long division of 875 by 25, showing the quotient 35 with the 5 in red above the division bar, this indicated that 25 goes into 125,5 times." height="95" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4c18343a0a016fdf58a81555a6386d62131b51d7" width="105"/> </p>
<p><strong>Step 6 -  Multiply </strong>this digit in the quotient by the divisor, \(5 \cdot 25\). </p>
<p>Write the result at the bottom below the previous number.</p>
<p><img alt="Long division of 875 by 25, showing the quotient 35 with the 5 in red above the division bar, this indicated that 25 goes into 125, 5 times. This equals 125 written in red under 125." height="117" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/d62338cb93a56ea6c55187ae25a16b905ce1b16e" width="105"/> </p>
<p><strong>Step 7 -</strong> <strong>Subtract </strong>the two values. Since there are no more digits to bring down, this value is the remainder. </p>
<p>The quotient is on top.</p>
<p><img alt="Long division example: 875 divided by 25. The quotient (35) is labeled at the top, and the remainder (0) is labeled at the bottom. Subtraction steps are shown: 87-75=12, the 5 is brought down, then 125-125=0." height="159" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b7f640649ba205c40c24e872024a7b61362cb3dc" width="225"/> </p>
<p>We check division by multiplying the quotient by the divisor.</p>
<p>If we did the division correctly, the product should equal the dividend.</p>
<ul>
<li>\(35 \cdot 25\)</li>
<li>\(875{\style{color:red}✓}\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we will divide a trinomial by a binomial. As you read through the Example, notice how similar the steps are to the numerical Example above.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Find the quotient: \((x^2+9x+20) \div (x+5)\).</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> Write it as a long division problem. Be sure the dividend is in standard form.</p>
<p><img alt="Math expression: x plus 5 times the square root of x squared plus 9x plus 20." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/04b21d17dec9baa3194d6cf86af5aa4cba8bfc6e" width="200"/> </p>
<p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Divide \(x^2\) by \(x\). It may help to ask yourself, “What do I need to multiply \(x\) by to get \(x^2\)?”</p>
<p><img alt="Mathematical expression: x plus 5 times the square root of x squared plus 9x plus 20, wit the x's and the x squared t highlighted in red." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/25c052f7dfcf4f98a83014971ff933cac8225641" width="200"/> </p>
<p><strong>Step 3 - </strong>Put the answer, \(x\), in the quotient over the \(x\) term. Multiply \(x\) times \(x + 5\). Line up the like terms under the dividend. </p>
<p><img alt="Long division of polynomials: x plus 5 divided into x squared plus 9x plus 20. The first subtraction step, x squared plus 5x, is in red and underlined in red below the dividend." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/7dde891929abfcb23e3379c9ac1429fe2be8f912" width="200"/> </p>
<p><strong>Step 4 -</strong> Subtract \(x^2 + 5x\) from \(x^2 + 9x\). You may find it easier to change the signs and then add. Then bring down the last term, \(20\).</p>
<p><img alt="Long division of polynomials: x plus 5 divided into x squared plus 9x plus 20. The first subtraction step, x squared plus 5x, are multipled by negative 1, this is indicated by a red negative signe in from of x squared and 5 x.  The expression after the subtraction is 4x and the 20 is brought down.  The expression 4x+20 is in red." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/2ee31bc0482996e6b2d393e7a17fdc4f1059ac6e" width="225"/> </p>
<p><strong>Step 5 -</strong> Divide \(4x\) by \(x\). It may help to ask yourself, “What do I need to multiply \(x\) by to get \(4x\)?” Put the answer, \(4\), in the quotient over the constant term. </p>
<p><img alt="A polynomial long division problem showing (x² + 9x + 20) divided by (x + 5). The subtraction steps and results are highlighted in red: x + 4 on top, -x² + (-5x) and 4x + 20 underneath." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b26317c879d6f7c2be57f39f39eaf7ea98cafd3b" width="225"/> </p>
<p><strong>Step 6  - </strong>Multiply \(4\) times \(x+5\). </p>
<p><img alt="Long division of x squared  + 9x + 20  by (x + 5)is shown, with subtraction steps in red. The result above the division bar is ((x + 4)" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/9f846bcf44e244891a5ec74e633cec9f296cd35f" width="225"/> </p>
<p><strong>Step 7 -</strong> Subtract \(4x+20\) from \(4x+20\).</p>
<p><img alt="Long division of (x² + 9x + 20) by (x + 5): The result is x + 4, with subtraction steps shown, and the final remainder is 0. Negative terms are highlighted in red." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/f502a39bb2e7f7c5bdd58309d2c0c45f6f5165c1" width="250"/> </p>
<p><strong>Step 8 -</strong> Check: Multiply the quotient by the divisor. You should get the dividend.</p>
<p> \((x+4)(x+5)\)<br/>
  \(x^2+9x+20{\style{color:red}✓}\)</p>
<p>When we divided \(875\) by \(25\), we had no remainder. But sometimes division of numbers does leave a remainder. The same is true when we divide polynomials. In the next Example, we’ll have division that leaves a remainder. We write the remainder as a fraction with the divisor as the denominator.</p>
<p>Look back at the dividend in the previous Example. The terms were written in descending order of degrees, and there were no missing degrees. The dividend in the next Example will be \(x^4-x^2+5^x-6\). It is missing an \(x^3\) term. We will add in \(0x^3\) as a placeholder.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Find the quotient: \((x^4-x^2+5x-6) \div (x+2)\).</p>
<p>Notice that there is no \(x^3\) term in the dividend. We will add \(0x^3\) as a placeholder.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> Write it as a long division problem. </p>
<p>Be sure the dividend is in standard form with placeholders for missing terms.</p>
<p><img alt="Mathematical expression: x plus 2 times the square root of x to the fourth power plus 0 times x cubed (in red) minus x squared plus 5x minus 6." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b4941ec2c446588b4596a562e5ea96998c9e7a15" width="300"/> </p>
<p><strong>Step 2 - </strong>Divide \(x^4\) by \(x\).</p>
<p>  Put the answer, \(x^3\), in the quotient over the \(x^3\) term. Multiply \(x^3\) times \(x+2\). </p>
<p>Line up the like terms. Subtract and then bring down the next term.</p>
<p><img alt="Polynomial long division is shown: the divisor is x plus two,  and the dividend is x to the fourth power plus 0x to the thrid power minus x squared  plus 5x minus 6. The first step subtracts (x to the 4th power plus 2x to the thrid power), giving negative 2x to the third power minus x squared." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/2c4804a6043e02f1311f02cfb091a6f239203837" width="300"/> </p>
<p><strong>Step 3 -</strong> Divide \(-2x^3\) by \(x\).</p>
<p>  Put the answer, \(-2x^2\), in the quotient over the \(x^2\) term. </p>
<p>Multiply \(-2x^2\) times \(x+1\). Line up the like terms.  </p>
<p>Subtract and bring down the next term.</p>
<p><img alt="Long division of polynomials showing x cubed minus 2x squared) divided into (x to the 4th power plus zero x to the third power minus x squared  plus 5x minus 6, with intermediate steps and subtractions highlighted, and remainder 3x squared plus 5x at the bottom." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/ed590d433a425ef0a479df42453d4532ed686fbd" width="325"/> </p>
<p><strong>Step 4 -</strong> Divide \(3x^2\) by \(x\).</p>
<p>  Put the answer, \(3x\), in the quotient over the \(x\) term. </p>
<p>Multiply \(3x\) times \(x+1\). </p>
<p>Line up the like terms. Subtract and bring down the next term.</p>
<p><img alt="Long division of polynomials showing x cubed minus 2x squared) divided into (x to the 4th power plus zero x to the third power minus x squared  plus 5x minus 6 by x plus 2, with subtraction steps and remainders, some elements in red to highlight each step." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/17fb04d990983a4072ae9fc64ecfdc293ce4f399" width="350"/> </p>
<p><strong>Step 5 - </strong>Divide \(-x\) by \(x\). Put the answer, \(-1\), in the quotient over the constant term. </p>
<p>Multiply \(-1\) times \(x+1\). Line up the like terms. </p>
<p>Change the signs and then add.  </p>
<p>Write the remainder as a fraction with the divisor as the denominator.</p>
<p><img alt="Long division of polynomials showing x cubed minus 2x squared) divided into (x to the 4th power plus zero x to the third power minus x squared  plus 5x minus 6 by x plus 2, with subtraction steps and remainders, some elements in red to highlight each step." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/95ecf79fb59faf56055af66b8da6194196f3c932" width="375"/> </p>
<p><strong>Step 6 - </strong>To check, multiply \((x+2)(x^3−2x^2+3x−1−\frac{4}{x+2})\). </p>
<p>The result should be \(x^4−x^2+5x−6\).</p>
<p>In the next Example, we will divide by \(2a+3\). </p>
<p>As we divide, we will have to consider the coefficients as well as the variables.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>
<p>Find the quotient: \((8a^3+27) \div (2a+3)\).</p>
<p>This time, we will show the division all in one step. We need to add two placeholders to divide.</p>
<p><img alt="Long division of polynomials showing x cubed minus 2x squared) divided into (x to the 4th power plus zero x to the third power minus x squared  plus 5x minus 6 by x plus 2, with subtraction steps and remainders.

<p>To check, multiply \((2a+3)(4a^2-6a+9)\).</p>
<p>The result should be \(8a^3+27\).</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Example 4</strong></p>
<p>Find the quotient: \((2x+14) \div (x+7)\). Can you see a quick way to solve this?</p>
<p>
    \begin{array}{r}
    2\phantom{)} \\
    x+7{\overline{\smash{\big)}\,2x+14}}\\
    \underline{-~\phantom{(}(2x+14)}\\
    0\\
    \end{array}
  </p>
<p>The answer is 2.</p>
