<h4>Activity</h4>
<p>In a function, there are two quantities called <span data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">variables</span>. The <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">independent variable</span> is the input, while the <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">dependent variable</span> is the output.</p>
<p>Here are two pairs of quantities from a situation you’ve seen in this lesson. Each pair has a relationship that
  can be defined as a function.</p>
<ul>
<li>Time, in seconds, since the dog owner left and the total number of times the dog has barked</li>
<li>Time, in seconds, since the owner left and the total distance, in feet, that the dog has walked while waiting</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose one pair of quantities and express their relationship as a function.</p>
