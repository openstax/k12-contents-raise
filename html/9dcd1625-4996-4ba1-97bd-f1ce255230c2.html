<p>In grade 8, students learned that a function is a rule that assigns exactly one output to each input. They represented functions in different ways&mdash;with verbal descriptions, algebraic expressions, graphs, and tables&mdash;and used functions to model relationships between quantities, linear relationships in particular.</p>
<p>In this unit, students expand and deepen their understanding of functions. They develop new knowledge and skills for communicating about functions clearly and precisely, investigate different kinds of functions, and hone their ability to interpret functions. Students also use functions to model a wider variety of mathematical and real-world situations.</p>
<p>The unit opens with a refresher on what functions are and what they are not. Students use descriptions, tables, and graphs to reason about the idea of &ldquo;exactly one output for each input.&rdquo; Then, students learn that function notation is an efficient way to communicate succinctly about functions and devote some focused time to interpreting this new notation and using it. They continue this work throughout the unit, employing the notation to perform increasingly sophisticated mathematical work: to analyze and compare functions, to write rules of functions (primarily linear functions), to solve for an input, to graph functions, and more.</p>
<p>Next, students focus their attention on graphs of functions and on how they help tell stories about the relationships between the quantities in the functions. Students interpret features of graphs and relate them to features of situations, using terms such as &ldquo;maximum,&rdquo; &ldquo;minimum,&rdquo; and &ldquo;intercepts&rdquo; to describe their observations. From a graph, students can see intervals where the values of a function increase or decrease. They learn to use average rates of change to more precisely describe how quickly these values rise or fall. Students also sketch graphs to depict qualitative behavior of functions.</p>
<p>Students then go on to take a closer look at the input and output of a function. They think about possible and reasonable input and output values and learn to identify the domain and range of a function based on contextual and graphical information. This new awareness of input and output in turn helps students make sense of piecewise-defined functions, in which different rules apply to different intervals of the domain, producing different sets of output values.</p>
<p>Students close the unit by examining a sequence as a particular type of function. Through many concrete examples, students learn to identify geometric and arithmetic sequences. Students begin with an invitation to describe sequences with informal language. They write out the terms of sequences arising from mathematical situations, in addition to interpreting and creating tables and graphs about the given relationship. Students learn that sequences are a type of function in which the input variable is the position and the output variable is the term at that position. They learn to interpret and then write their own definitions for sequences recursively using function notation.</p>
<p>Expressions for the nth term of a sequence are built up through expressing regularity in repeated reasoning, building on students&rsquo; prior experiences studying linear functions and experience with exponent patterns, which will lead to the study of exponential functions.</p>
