<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Analyze a situation and determine whether it makes sense to connect the points on the graph that represents the situation. </li>
<li> Describe the relationship in a graph of an exponential function using function notation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
<li> 5.9.1: Evaluating Expressions for Different Values of \(x\)</li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you addressed a common confusion of mistaking the expression \(2^x\) for the expression \(x^2\).</li>
</ul>
<li> 5.9.2: Analyze Underlying Relationship in a Graph of a Function&nbsp; </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you were given a graph of a function, analyzed the underlying relationship, and described it using function notation. </li>
</ul>
<li> 5.9.2: Self Check&nbsp; </li>
<li> 5.9.3: Graph Equations to Solve Problems </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you graphed equations to solve problems and thought about appropriate values of their variables. </li>
</ul>
<li> 5.9.3: Self Check&nbsp; </li>
<li> 5.9.4: Deciding on Graphing Window&nbsp; </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you were given an additional opportunity to apply what you know about key characteristics of an exponential function and used it to model real-world data. </li>
</ul>
<li> 5.9.5: Interpret Graphs to Find Approximate Values </li>
<ul>
<li> In this activity, you interpreted graphs to determine an approximate value of a function. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li> 5.9.6: Practice </li>
</ul>
