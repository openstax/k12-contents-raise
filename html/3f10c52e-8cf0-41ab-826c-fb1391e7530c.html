<p>A tennis ball is hit by a racket.</p>
<p>The function \(h(t) = -3t^2+ 7t + 3\) models the height in meters, \(h\), of the tennis ball \(t\) seconds after the impact with the racket.</p>
<p>Use graphing technology to determine the amount of time that has passed from the tennis ball being hit to when it reaches the ground.</p>
