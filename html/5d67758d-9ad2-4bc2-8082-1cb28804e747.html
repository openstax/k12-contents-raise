<h4>Solve Applications of Systems of Inequalities</h4>
<p>When we use variables other than \(x\) and \(y\)&nbsp;to define an unknown quantity, we must change the names of the axes of the graph as well.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
Use the following information to answer questions 1-4.</p>
<blockquote><p>Omar needs to eat at least 800 calories before going to his team practice. All he wants is hamburgers, \(h\), and cookies, \(c\), and he doesn&rsquo;t want to spend more than $5. At the hamburger restaurant near his college, each hamburger has 240 calories and costs $1.40. Each cookie has 160 calories and costs $0.50.</p></blockquote>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>Write a system of inequalities to model this situation.<br><br>
<strong>Solution</strong><br>
    Let \(h\) equal the number of hamburgers.<br>
     Let \(c\) equal the number of cookies.<br><br>
     To find the system of equations, translate the information.<br>
</li>
<ul type="none">
<li>The calories from hamburgers at 240 calories each, plus the calories from cookies at 160 calories each must be more than 800.<br>
            \(240h+160c&ge;800\)</li><br>
<li>The amount spent on hamburgers at $1.40 each, plus the amount spent on cookies at $0.50 each must be no more than $5.00.<br>
            \(1.40h+0.50c&le;5\)</li><br>
<li>The number of hamburgers must be greater than or equal to 0.<br>
          \(h&ge;0\)<br><br>
          The number of cookies must be greater than or equal to 0. <br>
            \(c&ge;0\)<br><br></li>
<li>We have our system of equations.<br><br>
          \(\left\{\begin{array}{l}240h\;+\;160c\;\geq\;800\\1.40h\;+0.50c\;\leq\;5\\h\;\geq\;0\\c\;\geq\;0\end{array}\right.\) </li>
</ul>
<br>
<li>Graph the system.<br><br>
<strong>Solution</strong><br>
  Since \(h&ge;0\) and \(c&ge;0\) all solutions will be in the first quadrant. As a result, our graph shows only quadrant one.<br><br>
<ul type="none">
<li>To graph \(240h+160c&ge;80\), graph \(240h+160c=800\) as a solid line. Choose \((0,0)\) as a test point. Since it does not make the inequality true, shade (red) the side that does not include the point \((0,0)\).<br><br>
<img alt="graph of 240h+160c is greater than or equal to 800 and graph of 1.40h +0.50c is less than or equal to 5" class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="389" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/a33241cd08b3ea9848101b3823e7dcf56f94a8ac" width="382">
</li>
<li>Graph \(1.40h+0.50c&le;5\).<br>
          The boundary line is \(1.40h+0.50c=5\).<br> We test \((0, 0)\) and it makes the inequality true.<br>
          We shade the side of the line that includes \((0, 0)\).<br><br>
        The solution of the system is the region of the graph that is shaded the darkest. The boundary line sections that border the darkly shaded section are included in the solution as are the points on the \(x\)-axis from \((5, 0)\) to \((10, 0)\).   
        </li>
</ul>
</li> <br>
<li>Could he eat 3 hamburgers and 1 cookie?<br><br>
<strong>Solution</strong><br> 
    To determine if 3 hamburgers and 1 cookie would meet Omar&rsquo;s criteria, we see if the point \((3, 2)\) is in the solution region.<br>
    It is, so Omar might choose to eat 3 hamburgers and 1 cookie.</li><br>
<li>Could he eat 2 hamburgers and 4 cookies?<br><br>
<strong>Solution</strong><br> 
    To determine if 2 hamburgers and 4 cookies would meet Omar&rsquo;s criteria, we see if the point \((2, 4)\) is in the solution region.<br>
    It is, so Omar might choose to eat 2 hamburgers and 4 cookies.&nbsp;<br><br>
    We could also test the possible solutions by substituting the values into each inequality.
  </li>

<h4>Try It: Solve Applications of Systems of Inequalities</h4>
<br>
<p>Use the following information for questions 1-4.<br>
<blockquote>Philip&rsquo;s doctor tells him he should add at least 1,000 more calories per day to his usual diet. Philip wants to buy protein bars, \(p\), that cost $1.80 each and have 140 calories and juice, \(j\), that costs $1.25 per bottle and has 125 calories. He doesn&rsquo;t want to spend more than $12.</blockquote>
