<h3>Linear Equations</h3>
<p><strong>In this unit, your student will analyze constraints on different quantities. For example:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The amount you spend on a bicycle may be limited by how much you have saved.</li>
  <li>To qualify for a sports team, your child may need to practice a minimum number of hours.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p>For the parking meter situation, we can see that using more dimes to make $1.50 means that we can use fewer nickels, and vice-versa. A graph allows us to see this relationship even more clearly.</p>

  <p>Each point on the graph represents a combination of nickels and dimes that totals $1.50. For example, if you use 8 nickels (worth $0.40), you will need 11 dimes (worth $1.10).</p>

<p> <strong>Try this task with your student</strong> <br>Priya is saving money to go on an overnight school trip.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The cost of the trip is $360.</li>
  <li>She has a job at a convenience store, which pays $9 per hour</li>
  <li>When she babysits for a family in her neighborhood, she earns $12 per hour.</li>
</ul>
<p>The equation&nbsp;\( 9x + 12y = 360 \) represents all the combinations of hours Priya could work at each job and earn a
  total of $360. Here is a graph showing those combinations:</p>

<h4>Review</h4>
<p><strong>Video lesson summaries for Unit 1: Linear Equations</strong>
</p>
<p>Each video highlights key concepts and vocabulary that students learn across one or more lessons in the unit. The content of these video lesson summaries is based on the written Lesson Summaries found at the end of lessons in the curriculum. The goal of these videos is to support students in reviewing and checking their understanding of important concepts and vocabulary</p>
  <p><strong>
    Here are some possible
    ways families can use these videos:
  </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Keep informed on concepts and vocabulary students are learning about in class.</li>
  <li>Watch with their students and pause at key points to predict what comes next or think up other examples of vocabulary terms.</li>
</ul>
