<h3>Real-World Applications</h3>
<p>In this unit, your student will analyze constraints on different quantities. For example:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>The amount you spend on a bicycle may be limited by how much you have saved.</li>
  <li>To qualify for a sports team, your child may need to practice a minimum number of hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some examples of constraints using mathematical notation:</p>
<table class="os-raise-textheavytable">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col"> Real-World Constraint </th>

    <tr>
      <td> An apartment building only allows dogs that weigh less than 20 pounds. </td>
      <td> \( w &lt; 20 \)<br></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> A casserole recipe calls for four cups of vegetables. You have mushrooms, green beans, and broccoli. </td>
      <td> \( m + g + b = 4 \)<br></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> For a concert to be performed, the artists need to be sure of $1,000 in ticket sales. Tickets for children
        under 18 are $12.50, and tickets for adults are $15. </td>
      <td> \( 12.5c + 15a &ge; 1,000 \)<br></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> You need $1.50 in coins for a parking meter. You have a bunch of nickels and dimes. </td>
      <td> \( 5n + 10d = 150 \)<br></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<p>For the parking meter situation, we can see that using more dimes to make $1.50 means that we can use fewer nickels, and
vice-versa. A graph allows us to see this relationship even more clearly. </p>
<img alt="Graph, number of dimes, number of nickels." height="136"

<p>Each point on the graph represents a combination of nickels and dimes that totals $1.50. For example, if you use 8
nickels (worth $0.40), you will need 11 dimes (worth $1.10).</p>
<p>> <strong>Here is a task for you to try with your student:</strong> &nbsp; Priya is saving money to go on an
overnight school trip.</p>>
<ul>
  <li>The cost of the trip is $360.</li>
  <li>She has a job at a convenience store, which pays $9 per hour</li>
  <li>When she babysits for a family in her neighborhood, she earns $12 per hour.</li>
</ul>
<p>The equation&nbsp;\( 9x + 12y = 360 \) represents all the combinations of hours Priya could work at each job and earn a
total of $360. Here is a graph showing those combinations:</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>What are the coordinates of point A?</li>
  <li>What does it tell us about the number of hours Priya worked at each job?</li>
  <li>Answer the same questions about points B and C.</li>
  <li>Point D is not on the line. How should we interpret point D?</li>
  <li>Point E is not on the line. How should we interpret point E?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>(20, 15)</li>
  <li>Priya works 20 hours at the convenience store and 15 hours babysitting.</li>
  <li>Point B: (32, 6). Priya works 32 hours at the convenience store and 6 hours babysitting. Point C: (40, 0). Priya
    works 40 hours at the convenience store and does not babysit at all.</li>
  <li>Priya does not make enough money. She works 24 hours at the convenience store and 8 hours babysitting. She makes
    only $312, since \(&nbsp;24 &sdot; 9 + 8 &sdot; 12 = 312&nbsp;\).</li>
  <li>Priya makes more than enough money: $438. She works 30 hours at the convenience store and 14 hours babysitting.
    \(&nbsp;30 &sdot; 9 + 14 &sdot; 12 = 438&nbsp;\).</li>

<h3>Video Lesson Summaries</h3>
<p>Here are the video lesson summaries for Unit 1: Linear Equations. Each video highlights key concepts and vocabulary
  that students learn across one or more lessons in the unit. The content of these video lesson summaries is based on
  the written Lesson Summaries found at the end of lessons in the curriculum. The goal of these videos is to support
  students in reviewing and checking their understanding of important concepts and vocabulary. Here are some possible
  ways families can use these videos:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Families can stay informed on concepts and vocabulary students are learning about in class.</li>
  <li>Families can watch with their students and pause at key points to predict what comes next or think up other
    examples of vocabulary terms.</li>
</ul>
