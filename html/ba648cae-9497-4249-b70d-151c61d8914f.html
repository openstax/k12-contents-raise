      <p>In this unit, your student will analyze constraints on different quantities. For example:&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The amount you spend on a bicycle may be limited by how much you have saved.</li>
        <li>To qualify for a sports team, your child may need to practice a minimum number of hours.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here are some examples of constraints using mathematical notation:</p>

      </table><br>For the parking meter situation, we can see that using more dimes to make $1.50 means that we can use fewer nickels, and vice-versa. A graph allows us to see this relationship even more clearly.

          <div>Each point on the graph represents a combination of nickels and dimes that totals $1.50. For example, if you use 8 nickels (worth $0.40), you will need 11 dimes (worth $1.10).</div>

        <h3><span>Video Lesson Summaries</span></h3>
        <p>Here are the video lesson summaries for Unit 1: Linear Equations. Each video highlights key concepts and vocabulary that students learn across one or more lessons in the unit. The content of these video lesson summaries is based on the written Lesson Summaries found at the end of lessons in the curriculum. The goal of these videos is to support students in reviewing and checking their understanding of important concepts and vocabulary. Here are some possible ways families can use these videos:<br></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Families can stay informed on concepts and vocabulary students are learning about in class.</li>
          <li>Families can watch with their students and pause at key points to predict what comes next or think up other examples of vocabulary terms.</li>
