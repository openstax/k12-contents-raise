<p>In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Choose a domain that makes sense in a revenue situation. </li>
  <li> Model revenue with quadratic functions and graphs. </li>
  <li> Relate the vertex of a graph and the zeros of a function to a revenue situation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 7.7.1: Comparing Graphs of Functions
    <ul>
      <li> In this activity, you analyzed and compared the features of the graphs of four different functions. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> 7.7.2: Modeling Real-World Data with Quadratic Functions
    <ul>
      <li> In this activity, you analyzed the relationship between the price of downloading a movie and the number of downloads. You modeled and graphed the relationship as a quadratic function that showed the revenue as a function of the price of the download. You used this function, referred to as the demand function, to predict profit price points. </li>
      <li> 7.7.2: Self Check </li>
      <li> 7.7.2: Additional Resources </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> 7.7.3: The Domain, Vertex, and Zero of Quadratic Functions
    <ul>
      <li>In this activity, you looked at appropriate domains for quadratic functions given the situations they represented. You identified and estimated the vertex of the graph and the zeros of the functions. You used modeling and graphing to interpret upper or lower limits for the input, as well as whether all numbers made sense.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> 7.7.4: Relate the Domain of a Function to Its Graph
    <ul>
      <li> In this activity, you analyzed a graph that represented the revenue that a company would expect to see if they sell their product at a certain price. You used this information to determine an appropriate domain for the function of the graph. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>
