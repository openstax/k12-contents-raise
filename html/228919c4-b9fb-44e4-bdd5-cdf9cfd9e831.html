<h4>Interpreting Negative Constant Terms When Factoring Quadratic Expressions</h4>
<p>Consider the expression \(x^2&minus; 34x + 64\). (Note the leading coefficient is 1.)</p>
<p>We have factored expressions like this before. We know that when the constant term is positive, the signs of the constants in the factored form must be the same.</p>
<p>Since the middle term is negative, we know that both terms will be negative. So, \(x^2 &minus; 34x + 64\) factors into \((x &minus; 32)(x &minus; 2)\).</p>
<p>If the middle term was positive in the expression above, then both constants in the factored form would have been positive.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Now consider the expression \(x^2&minus; 2x &minus; 24\). (Note the leading coefficient is 1.)</p>
<p>The constant term is a negative, &ndash;24. To find its factored form, we are searching for two numbers that have a negative product. This means that these two numbers must have opposite signs since multiplying a positive number and a negative number yields a negative product.</p>
<p>Now look at the middle term, &ndash;2. We know the sum of these numbers must be &ndash;2. This means the factor with the larger absolute value must be negative.</p>
<p>Which factors of &ndash;24 have a sum of &ndash;2? The answer is &ndash;6 and 4. Since we know that the larger value must have a negative sign, this confirms the factors we are searching for are &minus;6 and 4.</p>
<p>This gives a factored form of \((x &minus; 6)(x + 4)\).</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Find the factored form. (Note the leading coefficient is 1.)</p>
<p>\(x^2 + 7x &minus; 18\)</p>
<p>The constant term is a negative, &ndash;18. To find its factored form, we are searching for two numbers that have a negative product.</p>
<p>The middle term is 7. The same two numbers must have a sum of +7.</p>
<p>Which two numbers have a product of &ndash;18 and a sum of +7?</p>
<p>The numbers are 9 and &ndash;2.</p>
<p>So, the factored form is \((x + 9)(x &minus; 2)\).</p>
