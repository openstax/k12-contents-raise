<p>In this lesson, you will encounter the quadratic formula and learn that it can be used to solve any quadratic equation. You can use the formula and verify that it produces the same solutions as those found using other methods, but it can be much more practical for certain equations.</p>
<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="os-raise-indent">
  <li> Use the quadratic formula to solve quadratic equations. </li>
  <li> Explain when some methods for solving quadratic equations can be more convenient than others. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>
