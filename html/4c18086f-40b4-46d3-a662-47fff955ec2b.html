<h3>Activity (10 minutes)</h3>
<p>This activity seeks to activate students’ prior understanding about the multiplication of multi-digit numbers and the area of a rectangle defined by dimensions with those numbers.

The activity also provides students with key experiences they will use in later activities to explore partial products and more abstract ideas such as multiplying monomials and binomials of degree one.</p>

<h3>Launch</h3>
<ol>
<li>Instruct students to play with the Area Model Algebra simulation for 5 minutes. </li>

  <li>
  Encourage them to share what they are trying or investigating with their group members. If needed, provide students with the question prompts: <em>“What did you try? What happened? How did you create that?”</em> And the sentence stem, <em>“I tried … and it caused … to happen.”</em> Note that students may investigate any of the screens. </li>
  <li>
  Circulate, addressing logistical concerns with accessing the simulation and observing student interactions and discoveries. 
  </li> 
</ol>

<h3>Student Activity</h3>

<div class="os-raise-familysupport">
  <p><a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/area-model-algebra/latest/area-model-algebra_en.html?screens=1,2,3" target="_blank">Access the interactive simulator </a>to begin this project.</p>
</div>

<p>In this activity, whenever you see &#128172;, stop and share your responses with your partner. If you have different responses, try to come to a consensus.</p>
<p>Today you are going to investigate something called an interactive simulation. It is a tool that will help you visualize how area model multiplication works.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/area-model-algebra/latest/area-model-algebra_en.html?screens=1,2,3" target="_blank">Open the interactive simulator</a>, Area Model Algebra in your web browser. You will use it to complete this project. It will look like the image above.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Play with any of the screens on Area Model Algebra for 5 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Complete the following questions.</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<p><li>What does the area of a rectangle have to do with multiplication? &#128172;</li></p>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p>Answers will vary, but here are some samples.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The area of a rectangle measures the amount of space covered by a rectangle. We can find the area by multiplying the dimensions.</li>
<li>The side lengths of a rectangle must be multiplied together to determine the area of the shape. </li>
<li>Dividing the sides into single units creates unit tiles that can be counted to find the area of the rectangle. If we side lengths were multiplied together, we would get the same answer as when we added the unit tiles. </li>
</ul>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
<p><li>Write down two things you notice or have questions about, and one thing a neighbor noticed that is interesting to you. </li></p></ol>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p>Answers will vary, but here are some samples.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The gray/shaded rectangle gets larger if I pull on the green circle.</li>
  <li>As the shaded rectangle changes shape, the top number and the side numbers change, too. </li>
  <li>I can use the triangle lines to divide up the shaded rectangle. </li>
  <li>When I use the triangle lines, it divides up the side lengths, too. </li>
  <li>The side boxes will tell me the dimensions of the rectangle and the total area, too. </li> 
  <li>When I click on the boxes under partial products, it shows me how much area is covered in each piece. It will even show me how the calculations are determined.</li>
  <li>I can make the big white rectangle be 20x20 or 100x100 squares. </li>
  <li>When I choose the 100x100 squares, the side lengths are measured in sets of 10. </li>
</ul>


<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<p>After 5 minutes, bring the class together for a brief discussion about what they noticed.

Project the sim so that you can have a student come to the front to demonstrate their thinking. 
<br><br><strong>Use the following questions to lead a class discussion.</strong>

</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<p><li>What is something you noticed you can do in this simulation? On the Explore screen, what do the red and blue triangles do? </li></p>


<p><li>Did anyone discover what this checkbox does? <em>Note: It may only be visible when students have selected to work with the 20x20 rectangle.</em> </li>

<p><li>What is the difference between these three ways of displaying partial products? </li>

<p><li>What does this dropdown do? <em>Note: This dropdown menu is visible when students use the Generic screen. Some students may not have accessed this part of the simulation yet.</em> </li>

<p><li>What questions do you have? (Write down student questions that you want them to answer by the end of the activity.)</li>

</ol>

<h3>Discussion Follow Up</h3>
<p>
Students will start to make meaning of an area model through noticing the total area, the partial products, and making sense of how the partial products are calculated. It is most important at this stage that students understand how to use the simulation and trust that they have ownership over how they interact with it. </p>
