<p dir="ltr">In this lesson, you learned how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tell which quantities in a situation can vary and which ones cannot.</li>
  <li>Use letters and numbers to write equations representing the relationships in a situation.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that helped you reach those goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1.2.1: Finding the Percent of 200&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you found different percentages of 200 by changing the percent to a decimal and writing an expression.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1.2.2: Modeling with Equations to Find Edges in Platonic Solids<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you modeled the relationship between the edges, vertices, and faces of Platonic solids with an equation.</li>
  </li>
  <li>1.2.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>
  <li>1.2.2: Additional Resources&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>

  <li>1.2.3: Writing Equations to Represent Relationships<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you worked to write more equations that modeled different situations.</li>
  </li>
  <li>1.2.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>
  <li>1.2.3: Additional Resources&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>

  <li>1.2.4: Writing Equations to Represent Relationships with Percentages<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you continued to write equations to model given situations but incorporated percentages.</li>
  </li>
  <li>1.2.4: Self Check</li>
  <li>1.2.4: Additional Resources&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>

  <li>1.2.5: Writing Equations to Represent T-Shirts<ul>
      <li>In this activity, you wrote an equation about the cost of T-shirts for a choir group. You also identified which quantities were fixed in the situation and which quantities could change.<br></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><span>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</span><br>
