<h3>Activity (15 minutes)</h3>
<p>In this activity, students apply what they know about the vertex form to modify a given quadratic expression such that its graph is translated in particular ways to produce a different vertex. Students also consider (by analyzing an argument) whether modifying the squared term of a quadratic expression in standard form produces the same translation on the graph as modifying the squared term of an expression in vertex form.</p>
<p>As they modify expressions to translate graphs, students make use of structure. As they analyze an argument about how changing a quadratic expression in standard form affects the graph, they practice explaining their thinking and critiquing the reasoning of others.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Remind students that they have studied the connections between quadratic expressions and their graphs over several lessons. They have matched expressions and graphs and sketched graphs of given expressions. Now they will think about how to change one or more parts of a quadratic expression so that its graph has certain features.</p>
<p>Before beginning the activity, ask students to describe the graph representing \(y=x^2\). Make sure students recall that the graph has a vertex at the origin and opens up. If needed, ask them to name some points that are on the graph, for example, \((-3,9),(-2,4),(-1,1),(0,0),(1,1),(2,4),(3,9)\).</p>
<p>Give students access to graphing technology, but tell students to answer the first question without using technology.</p>
<p>Consider arranging them in groups of two and encouraging them to discuss the last question with a partner after some quiet time to think individually. If students use a graph to illustrate that Kiran's statement is incorrect, encourage them to also use the expression in their justification.</p>

<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
<li>Kiran graphed the equation \(y=x^2+1\) and noticed that the vertex is at \((0,1)\). He changed the equation to \(y=(x&minus;3)^2+1\) and saw that the graph shifted 3 units to the right and the vertex is now at \((3,1)\).</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, he graphed the equation \(y=x^2+2x+1\) and observed that the vertex is at \((-1,0)\). Kiran thought, "If I change the squared term \(x^2\) to \((x&minus;5)^2\), the graph will move 5 units to the right and the vertex will be at \((4,0)\)."</p>

<ul>
<li> The vertex of the graph of the original equation \(y=x^2+2x+1\) is at \((-1,0)\). The vertex of \(y=(x&minus;5)^2+2x+1\) is at \((4,10)\). </li>
<li> Evaluating \(y=(x&minus;5)^2+2x+1\) at \(x = 4\) gives \(y=10\), not \(y=0\). </li>
<li> The original equation is not in vertex form, so changing \(x^2\) into \((x&minus;5)^2\) does not change the location of the vertex 5 units to the right. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Select students to share their equations for the first question and their explanations for how they knew what modifications to make.</p>
<p>Then, focus the discussion on the third question and how students knew that when a quadratic expression is in standard form, adding a constant term before squaring the input variable does not translate the graph the same way as when the expression is in vertex form. At this point, students are not expected to come up with a rigorous justification as to why the graph will not translate as Kiran described. They are only to make this observation and consider ways to explain it.</p>
<p>Solicit as many explanations as time permits. If no one mentioned that the expression \(x^2+2x+1\) is not in vertex form and that its parameters do not relate to the graph the same way, bring these points up.</p>
<p>If time permits, consider pointing out that in \(x^2+2x+1\), the input \(x\) shows up in the squared term and the linear term. If we subtract 5 from \(x\) before it is squared, but do not subtract 5 from \(x\) before it is multiplied by 2, then the graph does not shift horizontally. (If we graph \((x&minus;5)^2+2(x&minus;5)+1\), the graph does shift 5 units to the right.) In a later course, students will look more closely at the effects on the graph of replacing \(f(x)\) by, for instance, \(f(x)+k\) and \(f(x+k)\).</p>

<p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: To move the graph to the right, 5 would have to be added to \(x\). Also, notice the coefficient of the squared term is negative. The answer is it reflects over the \(x\)-axis, moves left 5, and down 10.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s correct! Check yourself: The negative in the front causes the parabola to reflect over the \(x\)-axis. The vertex will be at \((-5, -10)\) so the graph of \(y=x^2\) shifts left 5 and down 10.</p>

<p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: The constant term is negative, so the graph shifts down. The answer is it reflects over the \(x\)-axis, moves left 5, and down 10.</p>

<h3>7.17.2: Additional Resources</h3>
<p><strong><em>The following content is available to students who would like more support based on their experience with the self check. Students will not automatically have access to this content, so you may wish to share it with those who could benefit from it.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<h4>Transforming Graphs of Quadratics</h4>
<p>The graphs of \(y=x^2\), \(y=x^2+12\), and \(y=(x+3)^2\) all have the same shape but their locations are different. The graph that represents \(y=x^2\) has its vertex at \((0, 0)\).</p>
<p><img alt="Three parabolas in x y plane, origin O." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/d876c425fd41cfada69fb6bf00502ec7e3e3c2b5"></p>
<p>Notice that adding 12 to \(x^2\) raises the graph by 12 units, so the vertex of that graph is at \((0, 12)\). Replacing \(x^2\) with \((x+3)^2\) shifts the graph 3 units to the left, so the vertex is now at \((-3, 0)\).</p>
<p>We can also shift a graph both horizontally and vertically.</p>
<p>The graph that represents \(y=(x+3)^2 +12\) will look like that for \(y=x^2\) but it will be shifted 12 units up and 3 units to the left. Its vertex is at \((-3, 12)\).</p>
<p><img alt="Two parabolas in x y plane, origin O." src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/74c7e56b30ffad5602a6859500e4f1f324292a73"></p>
<p>The graph representing the equation \(y=-(x+3)^2+12\) has the same vertex at \((-3, 12)\), but because the squared term \((x+3)^2\) is multiplied by a negative number, the graph is flipped over horizontally, so that it opens downward.</p>

<h4>Try It: Transforming Graphs of Quadratics</h4>
<p>What transformations and shifts need to be made to change \(y=x^2\) to \(y=-(x-2)^2+7\)?</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution </strong>button to compare your work.</p>
<p>Here is how to determine the transformations needed:</p>
<p>Step 1<br>
  Identify the vertex of the new function.<br>
  \((2, 7)\)</p>
<p>Step 2<br>
  Identify the shifts needed to go from the origin \((0,0)\) to the new vertex.<br>
  Right 2, up 7</p>
<p>Step 3<br>
  Ask: Does the parabola open up or down? Does it reflect over the \(x\)-axis?<br>
  Opens down since the equation leads with a negative. Reflects over the \(x\)-axis. </p>
<p>The transformations needed are right 2, up 7, and a reflection over the \(x\)-axis.</p>
