<h4>Is It Causation?</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Correlation
  means there is a relationship or pattern between the values of two
  variables. A scatter plot displays data about two variables as a set of
  points in the \( xy \)-plane and is a useful tool for determining if
  there is a correlation between the variables.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Causation
  means that one event causes another event to occur. Causation can only
  be determined from an appropriately designed experiment. In such
  experiments, similar groups receive different treatments, and the
  outcomes of each group are studied. We can only conclude that a
  treatment causes an effect if the groups have noticeably different
  outcomes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Why doesn&rsquo;t correlation mean causation?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even
  if there is a correlation between two variables, we cannot conclude
  that a change in one variable causes a change in the other. This relationship could
  be coincidental, or a third factor may be causing both variables to
  change.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Liam
  collected data on the sales of ice cream cones and air conditioners in
  his hometown. He found that when ice cream sales were low, air
  conditioner sales tended to be low, and that when ice cream sales were
  high, air conditioner sales tended to be high.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Liam can conclude that sales of ice cream cones and air conditioners are positively correlated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Liam
  can&rsquo;t conclude that selling more ice cream cones causes more air
  conditioners to be sold. It is likely that the increases in the sales of
  both ice cream cones and air conditioners are caused by a third factor,
  an increase in temperature!</p>
