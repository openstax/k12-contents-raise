<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Thomasina used a quadratic data set to create a curve of best fit for her data. Then she accidentally spilled paint on her paper and lost some of the entries in the table.</p>
<div class="os-raise-ib-desmos-gc" data-bottom="-100" data-equations='["y=-.34x^2+30.31x+18.45"]' data-left="-10" data-right="100" data-schema-version="1.0" data-top="800"></div>
<p>(Students were provided access to Desmos)</p>
<p>She needs to work backward to fill in the missing entries in her data set. Use the curve of best fit she created to complete the table.</p>

<h3>Response to Student Thinking</h3>
<h4>Press Pause</h4>
<p>At this point, students need to be able to evaluate and interpret quadratic equations with equations, graphs, and tables. If students continue to struggle, select examples from this unit to highlight and clarify misconceptions, and then have students work to revise cool downs and reflect on their misconceptions. Practice problem 10 from this lesson provides a similar opportunity for practice and additional formative assessment. The incorrect equations from question 5 could also be adapted for practice purposes. </p>
