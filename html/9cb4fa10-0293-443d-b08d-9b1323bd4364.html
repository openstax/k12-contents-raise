<h3>Project Activity (10 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>The purpose of this activity is for students to use what they know to solve an unfamiliar problem. This is a preview of solving a system consisting of a linear equation and a quadratic equation algebraically and graphically, which students will study more in depth in a future course.</p>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p> Here are graphs of a linear function and a quadratic function. The quadratic function is defined by the expression \((x&minus;4)^2&minus;5\).</p>
<p>Find the coordinates of \(P\), \(Q\), and \(R\) without using graphing technology. Show your reasoning.</p>

<h4>Student Response</h4>
<p>\(P=(0,11)\)</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> The quadratic expression \((x&minus;4)^2&minus;5\) can be rewritten in standard form as \(x^2&minus;8x+11\). The constant term 11 means the \(y\)-intercept is \((0,11)\). </li>
</ul>
<p> \(Q=(3,-4)\) and \(R=(6,-1)\)</p>
<ul class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li>The line has a \(y\)-intercept of \((0,-7)\) and a slope of 1, so its equation is \(y=x&minus;7\). \(Q\) and \(R\) are the points where the two functions have the same values, so \(x^2&minus;8x+11=x&minus;7\) at those points. Solving the equation gives \(x=6\) and \(x=3\). </li>
</ul>
<p>\(\begin{array}{rcl}\;x^2-8x+11\;&amp;=&amp;x-7 \\ x^2-8x-x+11+7\;&amp;=&amp;0 \\ x^2-9x+18\;&amp;=&amp;0 \\ (x-6)(x-3)\;&amp;=&amp;0 \end{array}\)</p>
<p class="os-raise-noindent">\( x-6=0\) or \(x-3=0\) <br> \(\;\;\;\;\;\;x=6\) or \(x=3\)</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Invite one or more students to describe how they found their solutions in their own words, or if they got stuck, demonstrate the progress that they made.</p>
