<p>A Sierpinski triangle can be created by starting with an equilateral triangle, breaking the triangle into 4 congruent equilateral triangles, and then removing the middle triangle. Starting from a single black equilateral triangle:</p>

    Let \(S\) be the number of black triangles in Step \(n\). Define \(S(n)\) recursively.
  </li>
  <p> <strong>Answer: </strong>
    \(S(1)=3,S(n)=3 \cdot S(n&minus;1)\) for \(n\geq2\).

  <li>
    Andre and Lin are asked to write an equation for \(S\) that isn&rsquo;t recursive. Andre writes \(S(n)=3^n\) for \(n\geq0\), while Lin writes \(S(n)=3^n&minus;1\) for \(n\geq1\). Whose equation do you think is correct? Be prepared to show your reasoning.
  </li>
  <p> <strong>Answer: </strong>
    They are both correct. For example: Lin is correct because if the image shows Steps 1 to 4, her equation gives the correct number of triangles for each step. Andre is correct since if we start with the black triangle, which is like Step 0, then Step 1 is the one with three triangles and Step 2 has 9 triangles, and those numbers match his equation.
