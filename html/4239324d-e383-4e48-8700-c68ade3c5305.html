<h2>Activity (15 minutes)</h2>
<div class="body">
<p>Previously, students saw that certain moves can be made to an equation to create an equivalent equation. In this activity, they deepen that understanding by explaining why, if a given equation is true for a certain value of the variable, performing one of those moves leads to a second equation that is also true for the same variable value. This requires more than simply stating what the moves are, and it offers students opportunities to construct logical arguments.</p>
<p>Clarify the distinction with an example. Ask students: &ldquo;Consider these equations: <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3x - 5 = 16 \)</span> and <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3x = 21 \)</span>. The first equation is a true statement for a certain value of <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span>. Can you explain why the second equation must also be true for the same value of <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Explain that an answer such as &ldquo;Adding 5 to each side of the first equation gives the second equation&rdquo; is a description of the move rather than an explanation for why the second equation must be true.</p>
<p>An explanation may sound something like: &ldquo;We know that <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3x-5 \)</span> and 16 are equal when <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span> has a particular value. If we add the same number, like 5, to both <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3x-5 \)</span> and 16, the results are still equal for the same variable value. This means the statement <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3x = 21 \)</span> must be true for the same value of <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this partner activity, students take turns giving explanations and listening to and critiquing a partner&rsquo;s explanations. As students discuss their thinking, listen for explanations that are particularly clear so that they can be shared with the class later.</p>
</div>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<div class="body">
<p>Tell students that they have performed a number of moves to write equivalent equations and solve equations. They will now practice explaining to a partner why those moves are legitimate. Demonstrate what it means to explain or defend the steps rather than simply describing them, as shown in the Activity Narrative.</p>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Ask the partners in each group to choose different equations from each column. Give students a few minutes of quiet time to think about and write explanations about the equations in column A. Then, give students time to take turns sharing their explanations with their partner before moving on to column B.</p>
<p>Tell students that when one student explains, the partner&rsquo;s job is to listen and make sure that they agree and that the explanation makes sense. If they don&rsquo;t agree, the partners discuss until they come to an agreement.</p>
<p>Repeat the process with the equations in column B.</p>

<h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>
<div class="body">
<div class="imgrid">
<div class="g--row g--row-1">
<div class="g--col-1 g--column g--content g--half g--row-1">
<p>Here are some pairs of equations. While one partner listens, the other partner should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a pair of equations from column A. Explain why, if <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span> is a number that makes the first equation true, then it also makes the second equation true. </li>
<li>Choose a pair of equations from column B. Explain why the second equation is no longer true for a value of <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span> that makes the first equation true.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, switch roles until you run out of time or you run out of pairs of equations.</p>

<h3>Student Response</h3>
<div class="body">
<p>Column A: Sample response:</p>
<ol>
<li>By the distributive property, <span class="math math-repaired">\( 4(9-x) \)</span> is equal to <span class="math math-repaired">\( 36-4x \)</span> for any value of <span class="math math-repaired">\( x \)</span>. If <span class="math math-repaired">\( 4(9-x) \)</span> is equal to 16, then <span class="math math-repaired">\( 36-4x \)</span> is also equal to 16.</li>
<li>If the two sides of the equation are equal, then they are still equal if the same amount, in this case <span class="math math-repaired">\( 2x \)</span>, is subtracted from each side.</li>
<li>
<span class="math math-repaired">\( -3(2x +9) \)</span> divided by \(-3\) is <span class="math math-repaired">\( 2x+9 \),</span> and 12 divided by \(-3\) is \(-4\). Because <span class="math math-repaired">\(-3(2x +9) \)</span> is equal to 12, dividing each of them by \(-3\) gives the same result, so it is true that <span class="math math-repaired">\( 2x+9 \)</span> is equal to <span class="math math-repaired">\( -4 \)</span>.
            </li>
<li>Subtracting a number is equivalent to adding its opposite, so <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3 - x \)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3 + (- x) \)</span>. Changing the order in which we add two numbers doesn&rsquo;t change the sum, per the commutative property of addition. If <span class="math math-repaired">\( 5x \)</span> is equal to <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3+ (-x) \)</span>, then it is also equal to <span class="math math-repaired">\( -x +3 \)</span>.</li>
<li>Using the commutative property, <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3x - 6 + x \)</span> can be rewritten as <span class="math math-repaired">\( 3x + x - 6 \)</span>. Combining like terms gives an equivalent expression, <span class="math math-repaired">\( 4x - 6 \)</span>, so <span class="math math-repaired">\( 4x-6 \)</span> is also equal to 18.</li>
</ol>
<p>Column B: Sample response:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the expressions <span class="math math-repaired">\( 9x \)</span> and <span class="math math-repaired">\( 5x + 4 \)</span> are equal, then adding <span class="math math-repaired">\( 5x \)</span> to one expression and subtracting <span class="math math-repaired">\( 5x \)</span> from the other make the two expressions unequal.</li>
<li>The 9 on the right side of the equation is multiplied by 2. If the expression on the left side was also multiplied by 2, the two sides would stay equal, but only a part of the expression on the left is doubled, so the two sides of the equation are no longer equal.</li>
<li>If two expressions are equal, dividing one side by 6 but not dividing the other side by 6 makes them unequal.</li>
<li>The left side of the first equation is divided by \(-11\), but the right side has 11 added to it. Performing two different operations with different numbers on the same value may not keep an equation true.</li>
<li>Subtracting 4 from two values that are equal keeps the equation true. The expression on the left was multiplied (or divided) by \(-1\), but the expression on the right was not, so the two expressions are no longer equal.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>
<div class="body">
<p>Students may have trouble seeing why some equations in column B are not equivalent (particularly the second item, which contains a common error). Encourage these students to choose one pair of equations, solve one equation, and then substitute the solution into the other equation to see what goes wrong.</p>
</div>
<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>
<div class="body">
<p>Invite previously identified students to share their explanations on at least a couple of pairs of equations from each column. If not already clear from students&rsquo; explanations, emphasize that:</p>
<ul>
<li>If two expressions are equal, then performing the same addition (or subtraction) or multiplication (or division) to both expressions maintains the equality.</li>
<li>Applying the distributive, commutative, and associative properties (of multiplication or addition) to an expression doesn&rsquo;t change its value, so doing so to one side of a true equation doesn&rsquo;t change the equality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Explain to students that next they will look at some examples where the moves made to write equivalent equations appear to be acceptable but the resulting equations turn out to be false statements.</p>
