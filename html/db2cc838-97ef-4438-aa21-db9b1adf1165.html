<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>Here are three graphs representing three exponential functions: \(f\), \(g\), and \(h\).</p>
<p><img alt class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="279" role="presentation" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c91699a5862502edaffc0fc9cafd5d89472eebad" width="300"></p>
<p>The functions \(f\) and \(h\) are given by \(f(x)=10 \cdot 2^x\) and \(h(x)=20 \cdot 4^x\). Which of the following could define function \(g\)? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</p>
<p>Equation A: \(g(x)=20 \cdot (1.5)^x\)</p>
<p>Equation B: \(g(x)=20 \cdot (2.5)^x\)</p>
<p>Equation C: \(g(x)=10 \cdot (3.5)^x\)</p>
<p>Equation D: \(g(x)=20 \cdot (4.5)^x\)</p>
<p> <strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Equation B. The graph of \(g\)&nbsp;has the same \(y\)-intercept as the graph of \(h\), which is 20. It grows more quickly than \(f\)&nbsp;but more slowly than \(h\),&nbsp;so the growth factor must be greater than 2 but less than 4.</p>
