<p dir="ltr"><br>In this unit, you will learn about how to graph two-dimensional data and create models of the data to make predictions. You&rsquo;ll also use residuals to judge how good a model is and use correlation to describe how variables are related to each other.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Building Character: Purpose&nbsp;</h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Through their organization, Farms to Grow, Gordon Reed and Dr. Gail Myers work to promote the sustainability and history of Black farmers. They have a strong sense of purpose to make a positive contribution to the world.&nbsp;</span><br></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Throughout this unit, you will work on developing your <strong>purpose</strong>. Having purpose is showing a commitment to making a meaningful contribution to the world. Purpose drives you to make positive contributions in line with your own interests and strengths. And this pursuit gives your life direction and forward momentum; it motivates and guides your short-term goals and daily activities. With a strong sense of purpose, you flourish: you enjoy a more meaningful life, are healthier and more resilient to setbacks, live more energetically, and feel good about what you&rsquo;ve accomplished.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Think about your current sense of purpose. How many of the following statements are true for you?</p>
<ul>
  <li>I look for ways to have positive effects on others&rsquo; lives.</li>
  <li>I often reflect on my life goals and the kind of person I want to be.</li>
  <li>When I plan out my day, I consider how my activities connect to what I want to accomplish with my life.</li>
  <li>I often think about what I can offer the world, taking into account what the world needs as well as my personal strengths and interests.</li>
  <li>I often think about what matters most to me and why it matters.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Don&rsquo;t worry if none of these statements are true for you. Developing this trait takes time. Your first step starts today!</p>
