  <li>Explain your reasons for choosing that graph.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
  <p>Compare your answer: Your answer may vary, but here is a sample. <br>
  I substituted the coordinates of a few points above the line into the inequality and found that they are all not solutions. The point 
  \((0, 0)\), which is on the line, is also not a solution. I concluded that the points on and above the line are not solutions, and the region below the line represents the solutions.</p>
