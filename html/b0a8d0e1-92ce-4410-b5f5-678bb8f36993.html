<h3>Student Response</h3>
<p>Compare your answer:<br></p>
<div><span>1. Graph C</span><br><span>2. For example: I substituted the coordinates of a few points above the line into the inequality and found that they are all not solutions. The point&nbsp;\( (0,0) \), which is on the line, is also not a solution. I concluded that the points on and above the line are not solutions, and the region below the line represents the solutions.<br></span><br></div>

  <h4>More Chances</h4>Activities 2.11.2 and 2.11.3 both provide additional opportunities to consider how to make decisions about which side of the boundary line to shade.
