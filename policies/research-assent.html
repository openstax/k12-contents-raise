<h3>What is research?</h3>
<p>We are asking you to be in a research study.  Research is a way to test new ideas.  Research helps us learn new things.</p>
<p>Being in research is your choice.  You can say Yes or No.  Whatever you decide is OK.  We will not be upset with you in any way.</p>

<h3>Why are we doing this research?</h3>
<p>We would like you to help us test out a digital textbook meant to help students your age learn algebra. We want to add some things that we hope will make the textbook better, but we need to see how students use the book before we design these additions. If you choose to participate, we will record how you are using the textbook, how well you do in the class, and we may ask you some questions about how you learn and what motivates you. If you don’t want us to record how you use the textbook, just tell your teacher.</p>

<h3>What will happen in the research?</h3>
<p>Students who agree will do their normal algebra class activities. You may have to fill out a questionnaire  so we know what motivates you to learn. You will be assigned an anonymous participant number so we can keep track of your learning without knowing your name. Your use of the textbook, including how long you read, which pages you interact with most, and how you do on quizzes, will be recorded using this number (not your name). We will then compare how you use the textbook to how well you do in the class and on tests to see if how you use the book is related to how well you learned the material. You may be contacted by the researchers to be interviewed about your experience and preferences with digital learning. Whether you take part in this interview is up to you.</p>

<h3>What are the good things that can happen from this research?</h3>
<p>What we learn in this research will not help you now.  When we finish the research, we hope we know more about how people learn algebra. This may help other students learn algebra later on.</p>

<h3>What are the bad things that can happen from this research?</h3>
<p>There are no risks we can think of for taking part in this research. You do not have to answer any survey questions you are not comfortable with. We will not share your information with anyone - not your teachers or your parents. Only members of the research team will see how you use the book, and we will not know your name.</p>

<h3>What else should you know about the research?</h3>
<p>Being in the research is your choice. If you want to participate you don’t have to do anything- you’ll be automatically included. If you do NOT want to participate, please tell your teacher.</p>
<p>If you change your mind later that is OK.  You can stop being in the research at any time.  If you want to stop, please tell your teacher.</p>
 
<p>Take the time you need to make your choice.  Ask us any questions you have.  You can ask questions any time. To ask a question about the research, contact:</p>
