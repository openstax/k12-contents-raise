In this activity, students are given the graph of a function and asked to analyze the underlying relationship and describe it using function notation.</p>\n<p>The data used in this task are approximate, but the costs of solar energy during the time period mentioned in this activity can be appropriately modeled by an exponential decay model.</p>\n<h4> Launch</h4>\n<p>Elicit what students already know about solar cells. If students are unfamiliar with solar power and units of measurement for energy, give a brief introduction. Solar cells turn energy from the sun into electricity, a form of energy that is useful to humans. Energy is measured using units called watts. Over the course of the past several decades, the cost of solar cells has decreased. That is, we can manufacture solar cells that generate the same amount of electricity for less money.</p>\n<p>Read the opening sentence of the task and display the graph for all to see. To help them process the information in the graph and think about functions, ask if the price per watt is a function of time and if the time is a function of the price per watt.</p>\n<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n<div>\n  <p>Demonstrate and encourage students to use color coding and annotation to highlight connections between representations in a problem, for example, highlighting \\(f(4)\\) as written in the question and then highlighting the corresponding output value on the graph. Some students may benefit from reviewing that the \\(x\\)-coordinate is 4 and \\(f(4)\\) is the \\(y\\)-coordinate.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>The cost, in dollars, to produce 1 watt of solar energy is a function of the number of years since 1977, \\(t\\).</p>\n<p>From 1977 to 1987, the cost could be modeled by an exponential function \\(f\\).

These values represent the cost in dollars of 1 watt of solar energy in 1981 (4 years after 1977) and halfway through 1980 (3.5 years after 1977).\n\n    <br>\n    <br>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    When \\(f(t)=45\\), what is \\(t\\)?

Strategically, it is important to choose values of time \\(t\\) so that the price per watt \\(f(t)\\), in dollars, is unambiguous (for example, \\(t = 0\\), \\(t=1\\), and \\(t=2\\)). Because we are told that the price decreases exponentially, two values are enough to find the growth factor.</p>\n<p>Interpreting statements such as \\(f(4)=25\\) in terms of the context is a chance to highlight precision in language, for example, to articulate that the 4 means 4 years after 1977 (1981), and the value \\(f(4)=45\\) means that each watt produced via solar energy cost $45 in 1981.</p>\n<h3>5.9.2: Self Check&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity</em></strong>.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n        <p>The graph below shows the total smartphones, \\(s\\), in millions that were sold in the years, \\(t\\), since 2008.
