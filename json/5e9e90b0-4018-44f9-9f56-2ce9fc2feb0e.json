To make connections between different representations of functions, you will interpret rules of functions by comparing cell phone data plans to choose the most cost-effective plan. </p>\n<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Use technology to graph a function given in function notation, and use the graph to find the values of the function.</li>\n  <li>Be able to identify if a graph represents a function through the vertical line test.</li>\n  <li>Explain different ways to find the value of a function and to solve equations written in function notation.<br></li>\n  <li>Explain what makes a function a linear function.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>4.5.1: Finding Solutions of Equations </li>\n  <li>4.5.2: Using the Vertical Line Test\n    <ul>\n      <li>4.5.2: Self Check </li>\n      <li>4.5.2: Additional Resources</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>4.5.3: Comparing Functions\n    <ul>\n      <li>4.5.3: Self Check </li>\n      <li>4.5.3: Additional Resources</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>4.5.4: Using Function Notation and Graphing Technology (Optional)\n    <ul>\n      <li>4.5.4: Self Check </li>\n      <li>4.5.4: Additional Resources</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>4.5.5: Using Graphical and Algebraic Approaches for Finding Unknowns of Linear Functions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>4.5.6: Practice</li>\n  <li>4.5.7: Lesson Summary</li>\n</ul>"
