They discover that the expanded product of such factors can be expressed as a difference of two square numbers: \\(x^2- m^2\\). Students use diagrams and the distributive property to make sense of their observations.</p>\n<p>In the last question, they have an opportunity to notice that an expression in the form \\((x + m)^2\\) is not equivalent to \\(x^2+ m^2\\), to discourage overgeneralizing. Later in the lesson, they will transform quadratic expressions in standard form into factored form and vice versa.</p>\n<p>To answer the first two questions, some students may simply evaluate the expressions rather than reasoning about their structure. For example, to see if \\((10 + 3)(10 - 3)\\) is equivalent to \\(10^2- 3^2\\), they may calculate \\(13 \\cdot 7\\) and \\(100 - 9\\) and see that both are 91. Ask students to see if they could show that this is not a coincidence. Could they show, for example, that \\((50 + 4)(50 - 4)\\) would also be equivalent to \\(50^2-4^2\\)?</p>\n<p>As students work, look for those who expand the factored expression using the distributive property and leave the partial products unevaluated to show the equivalence of the two expressions.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Provide access to calculators, in case requested.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>Clare claims that \\((10 + 3)(10 - 3)\\) is equivalent to \\(10^2-3^2\\) and \\((20 + 1)(20 - 1)\\) is equivalent to \\(20^2-1^2\\).

(With some practice, it is possible to get really fast at this!)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\">\n  <li>Explain why this method works.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Any two-digit number can be written as \\(a + b\\), where \\(a\\) is 10 times the first digit and \\(b\\) is the second digit. We are interested in squaring \\(a + b\\):</p>\n<p>\\((a + b)^2=(a + b)(a + b)\\)</p>\n<p class=\"os-raise-indent\">\\(= a^2+ab +ab +b^2\\) by the distributive property</p>\n<p class=\"os-raise-indent\">\\(= a^2+ 2ab +b^2\\) by combining like terms</p>\n<p class=\"os-raise-indent\">\\(= a^2+b^2+2ab\\) because addition is commutative</p>\n<br>\n<p>We get the \\(a^2 + b^2\\) from squaring \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and adding them, and the \\(2ab\\) from multiplying the two values and doubling them.</p>\n<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>\n<p>Some students may struggle to generalize the pattern after just a few examples. Before starting the activity synthesis, provide additional factored expressions for students to expand, for instance: \\((x + 3)(x - 3)\\), \\((2x + 1)(2x - 1)\\), \\((4x + 5)(4x - 5)\\), and \\((6 - x)(6 + x)\\).</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>To help students generalize their observations, display the expression \\((x + m)(x - m)\\) and a blank diagram that can be used to visualize the expansion of the factors. Ask students what expressions go in each rectangle.</p>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"51\">\n    <col width=\"55\">\n    <col width=\"53\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>&nbsp;</td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(m\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>&nbsp;</td>\n      <td>&nbsp;</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(-m\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>&nbsp;</td>\n      <td>&nbsp;</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p>Illustrate that when the terms in each factor are multiplied out, the resulting expression has two squares, one with a positive coefficient and the other with a negative coefficient (\\(x^2\\) and \\(m^2\\)) and two linear terms that are opposites (\\(mx\\) and \\(-mx\\)). Because the sum of \\(mx\\) and \\(-mx\\) is 0, what remains is the difference of \\(x^2\\) and \\(m^2\\), or \\(x^2 - m^2\\). There is now no linear term.</p>\n<p>Emphasize that knowing this allows us to rewrite into factored form any quadratic expression that has no linear term and that is a difference of a squared variable and a squared constant. For example, we can write \\(x^2-9\\) as \\((x + 3)(x - 3)\\) because we know that when the latter is expanded, the result is \\(x^2-9\\).</p>\n<p>Use the last question to point out the importance of paying attention to the structure of these expressions (the subtraction in the first expression, the presence of both addition and subtraction in the second). For example, we can't use any patterns observed in this activity to rewrite \\(x^2+9\\) in factored form.</p>\n<h3>8.8.2: Self Check</h3>\n<em><strong>\n    <p>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</p>\n  </strong></em>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>\n        <p>Which of the following is equivalent to \\(9^2 - 6^2\\)?</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\((9 - 6)^2\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incorrect.
