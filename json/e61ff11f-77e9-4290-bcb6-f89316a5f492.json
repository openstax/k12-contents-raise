You will discover that adding a linear term to the squared term translates the graph in both horizontal and vertical directions. This understanding will show that writing an expression such as \\(x^2+b\\) in factored form can help us reason how to sketch the graph.</p>\n<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n    Explain how the \\(b\\) in \\(ax^2+bx+c\\) affects the graph of the equation.\n  </li>\n<li>\n    Match equations given in standard and factored form with their graph.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are the activities that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n    7.13.1: Equivalent Expressions\n  </li>\n<li>\n    7.13.2: The Linear Term in a Quadratic Expression\n  </li>\n<ul>\n<li>\n      7.13.2: Self Check\n    </li>\n<li>\n      7.13.2: Additional Resources\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<li>\n    7.13.3: Writing Equations that Represent a Graph\n  </li>\n<ul>\n<li>\n      7.13.3: Self Check\n    </li>\n<li>\n      7.13.3: Additional Resources\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<li>\n    7.13.4: Graphing Quadratic Equations\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll practice and review.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n    7.13.5: Practice\n  </li>\n<li>\n    7.13.6: Lesson Summary\n  </li>\n</ul>"
