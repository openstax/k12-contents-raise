Which are not?\" (The second and fourth expressions are perfect squares. The other two are not.) </li>\n  <li> \"How can you tell?\" (When in standard form, an expression with perfect squares has a constant term that is a number squared and a linear term that is twice that number. In \\(x^2+24x+144\\), we can see 144 is 12 squared, and 24 is twice 12. In \\(x^2&minus;40x+400\\), the term 400 is -20 squared and -40 is twice -20.) </li>\n  <li> \"Why isn't the third expression a perfect square? Isn't 16 a perfect square?\" (16 is 4 squared or -4 squared, but for the expression to be a perfect square, the coefficient of the linear term should be 8 (twice 4) or -8 (twice 4).) </li>\n  <li> \"Suppose we have two equations: \\(x^2&minus;10x+16=9\\) and \\(x^2&minus;40x+400=9\\). Which is easier to solve? Why?\" (The second one, because the equation has a perfect square on each side. It can be rewritten as \\((x&minus;20)^2=9\\). There are two numbers that can be squared to make 9, which are 3 and -3, so \\(x&minus;20=3\\) or \\(x&minus;20=-3\\).) </li>\n  <li> \"Can't we simply rewrite the left side of \\(x^2&minus;10x+16=9\\) in factored form and solve?\" (Rewriting the left side gives \\((x&minus;8)(x&minus;2)=9\\), but now we are stuck. We can't use the zero product property because the expression does not equal 0.) </li>\n</ul>"
