The total weight of the box and the contents inside it is 25.6 pounds. One way to represent this situation is with the equation <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 0.6 + 15b + 4 = 25.6 \\)</span>.</p>\n  <span>1. In this situation, what does the solution to the equation represent?</span><br><span><br></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"body\"><span>2. Select all equations that are equivalent to </span><span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 0.6 + 15b + 4=25.6 \\)</span><span>.</span></div>\n<div class=\"body\">\n  <ul>\n    <li><span>Equation A: </span><span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 15b + 4 = 25.6 \\)</span></li>\n    <li><span>Equation B: </span><span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 15b + 4 = 25 \\)</span></li>\n    <li><span>Equation C: </span><span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 3(0.6 + 15b + 4) = 76.8 \\)</span></li>\n    <li><span>Equation D: </span><span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 15b = 25.6 \\)</span></li>\n    <li><span>Equation E: </span><span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 15b = 21 \\)</span></li>\n  </ul>\n  <ol>\n  </ol>\n</div>\n<h3>Student Response</h3>\n<div class=\"body\">\n  <span>1. The weight, in pounds, of one bag of beans</span><br><span>2. B, C, and E</span><br>\n  <ol>\n  </ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"response-to-student-thinking\">\n  <h3>Response to Student Thinking</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"body\">If the majority of students struggle with this cool-down, consider building in 3 minutes to the launch of Activity 7.2. If students struggled to find all of the equivalent equations, consider showing the equations as a sequence&mdash;the original equation, followed by Equation B, followed by Equation E&mdash;and asking, &ldquo;How do we know these are equivalent?&rdquo; Or consider showing the original equation with Equation C directly underneath. If multiple students identified incorrect equations as equivalent, you might consider showing the original equation with Equation A or D directly underneath and asking &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Did the same thing happen to both sides?&rdquo;<br><br></div>\n<div class=\"body\">If only a few students struggle with this cool-down, then those are the students to support during Activity 1.7.2 and to pay careful attention to during the synthesis for 1.7.2.</div>\n<div class=\"student-summary\">\n  <div class=\"body\">\n  </div>\n</div>"
