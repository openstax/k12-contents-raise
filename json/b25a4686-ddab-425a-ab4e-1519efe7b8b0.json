And if there was any medicine in the body before injection, it wouldn&rsquo;t be accounted for by this equation, so \\(h\\)&nbsp;should probably start at 0. The scale for the vertical axis is also unreasonable. The medicine is decreasing in amount, starting from 20 milligrams, so 1,000 for the upper end of the axis is far too large. The negative values for \\(m\\)<i>&nbsp;</i>are also not needed because a negative amount of medicine would not make any sense here.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<!--Interaction End -->\n<br>\n<br>\n<!--Text Entry Interaction Start -->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"eventShow\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-content\">\n    <ol start=\"2\">\n      <li> Verify your answer by graphing the equation using graphing technology and using the given graphing window.
