It reinforces how each form gives different insights into the graph of a quadratic function.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Give students a minute of quiet time to think individually, and then ask them to share their thinking with a partner.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>Expressions in different forms can be used to define the same function. Here are three ways to define a function \\(f\\).</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Standard form</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Factored form</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Vertex form</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(f(x)=x^2-4x+3\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(f(x)=(x-3)(x-1)\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(f(x)=(x-2)^2-1\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(f(x)=ax^2+bx+c\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(f(x)=a(x-r_1)(x-r_2)\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p>Which form would you use if you want to find the following features of the graph of \\(f\\)?

Encourage students to name specific features of the graph of \\(f\\). If time permits, consider asking students to use all of the info they can gather to sketch a graph.</p>\n<p>If not already mentioned by students, point out that while the standard form allows us to find the \\(y\\)-intercept more readily, the \\(y\\)-intercept can always be found by evaluating the function at \\(x=0\\).</p>"
