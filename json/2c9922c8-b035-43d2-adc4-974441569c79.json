The pool has a capacity of 90 gallons. She turns the water off after 5 minutes, but she leaves the hose in the pool for another 3 minutes before putting it away.</p>\n<p>In this situation, the relationship between the gallons of water in the pool and the time, in minutes, since the parent started filling the pool can be seen as a function.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In that function, which variable is independent? Which one is dependent?</li>\n<li>Write a sentence of the form &ldquo;___ is a function of ___.&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Sketch a possible graph of the relationship on the coordinate plane. Be sure to label and indicate a scale on each axis.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-desmos-gc\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\"></div>\n<br>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>The time is independent. The amount of water is dependent.</li>\n<li>The amount of water, in gallons, is a function of time, in minutes, since water started filling the pool.</li>\n<li>See sample graph.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"Function. time in minutes and amount of water in gallons.\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/1f2dc89ad31e3410880fff4d74630191130928f7\"></p>\n<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>\n<h5>More Chances</h5>\n<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>"
