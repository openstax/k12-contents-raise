The work here prompts students to recognize structure in perfect-square expressions, particularly when written in standard form, preparing them to complete the square in an upcoming lesson.</p>\n<p>Students are given a series of expressions that are clearly perfect squares, for example, \\((3x)^2\\) or \\((x+4)(x+4)\\), and asked to rewrite them in standard form. As they repeatedly apply the distributive property to expand these expressions into standard form, students begin to recognize a pattern in how the two forms of expressions are related. They see that squaring an expression such as \\((x+n)\\) produces an expression in standard form in which the constant term is \\(n^2\\) and the linear term is \\(2n\\). Then, they use that insight to articulate why certain expressions in standard form (such as \\(x^2&minus;16x+64\\)) can be described as perfect squares.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Encourage and support opportunities for peer interactions.

(If some scaffolding is needed, consider starting with numbers, for example, \\((10+4)^2\\), then \\((x+4)^2\\), and then \\((x+n)^2\\).)</p>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"64\">\n    <col width=\"80\">\n    <col width=\"74\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>&nbsp;</td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(n\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x^2\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(nx\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(n\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(nx\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(n^2\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p>Additionally, many students will jump from \\((x+n)^2\\) to \\(x^2+n^2\\).

Encourage students to always rewrite expressions of the form \\((x+n)^2\\) as \\((x+n)(x+n)\\).</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Invite students to share their responses and reasoning for the last question. Make sure students see the structure that relates the expression in standard form and its equivalent expression in factored form. Highlight that:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> In each given example, the constant term is a number squared \\((n^2)\\), and the coefficient of the linear term is twice that number \\((2n)\\). </li>\n  <li> This is also true for the expression that contains fractions: \\(\\frac {1}{36}\\) is \\((\\frac {1}{6})^2\\) and \\(\\frac {1}{3}\\) is \\(2\\cdot \\frac {1}{6}\\). </li>\n  <li> We call these expressions \"perfect squares\" because they can be written as something squared: \\((x+3)^2\\), \\((x&minus;8)^2\\), and \\((x+ \\frac {1}{6})^2\\). </li>\n  <li> In general, when \\((x+n)\\) is squared and expanded, we have: \\(x^2+2nx+n^2\\). </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tell students that knowing about quadratic expressions that are perfect squares can help us solve all kinds of equations in upcoming lessons.</p>\n<h3>9.1.2: Self Check</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>\n        <p>Which of the following is equivalent to \\((x-4)^2\\)?</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x^2-16\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incorrect.
