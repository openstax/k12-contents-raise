Perfect square trinomials follow the pattern \\(a^2 \\pm 2ab + b^2\\) and factor to \\((a + b)^2\\) or \\((a &minus; b)^2\\), depending on the sign of the middle term in the trinomial.</p>\n<p>The difference of squares is represented by the binomial \\(a^2 &minus; b^2\\) and factors to the conjugate pair \\((a &minus; b)(a + b)\\).</p>\n<p>Recognizing the patterns of these special products will allow for the easy factoring of these particular cases.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Recognize the patterns of perfect square trinomials and factor them into the form \\((a + b)^2\\) or \\((a &minus; b)^2\\). </li>\n<li> Recognize the difference of squares and factor them into conjugate pairs. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li> Factor perfect square trinomials. </li>\n<li> Factor differences of squares. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<colgroup>\n<col>\n<col>\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>A10(D) rewrite polynomial expressions of degree one and degree two in equivalent forms using the distributive property;</p>\n<p>A10(E) factor, if possible, trinomials with real factors in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\), including perfect square trinomials of degree two; and</p>\n<p>A10(F) decide if a binomial can be written as the difference of two squares and, if possible, use the structure of a difference of two squares to rewrite the binomial.</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n<p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n<p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 6.6.1: Identifying Perfect Square Trinomials </li>\n<li> 6.6.2: Factoring Perfect Square Trinomials </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 6.6.2: Self Check </li>\n<li> 6.6.2: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 6.6.3: Factoring the Difference of Squares </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 6.6.3: Self Check </li>\n<li> 6.6.3: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 6.6.4: Sorting Polynomials by Factoring Methods </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 6.6.5: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Paper and pencil </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>None </li>\n</ul>\n<h4> Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson.
