They match equations and graphs representing two quadratic functions. The axes of the graphs are unlabeled, so students need to reason abstractly about the parameters in the expressions and the features of the graphs.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Encourage and support opportunities for peer interactions. Invite students to talk about their ideas with a partner before writing them down.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<br>\n<p><img height=\"182\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/05c4d743874e6414e9d720787af98245ec2791ad\" width=\"254\"></p>\n<p>Here are graphs representing the functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) given by \\(f(x)=x(x+6)\\) and \\(g(x)=x(x+6)+4\\).</p>\n<br>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"Reveal1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-content\">\n    <ol>\n      <li>Which graph represents \\(f(x)=x(x+6)\\)?
