They represent this relationship using a table, an expression, and a graph. They also explain the meaning of the numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)&nbsp;in an exponential expression \\(a\\cdot b^x\\), identifying their meaning in terms of a context (\\(a\\)&nbsp;is the initial amount, and \\(b\\)&nbsp;is the multiplier or growth factor) and also in terms of a graph (where \\(a\\)&nbsp;is the vertical intercept and \\(b\\)&nbsp;determines how quickly the graph increases). Students interpret the different representations of growth in terms of a bacteria population.</p>\n<p>In this and following lessons, students will often work with properties of exponents, a topic developed in grade 8. There is an optional activity intended to remind students of the convention that \\(a^0=1\\) for a non-zero number \\(a\\).</p>\n<p>Technology isn&rsquo;t required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems. We recommend making technology available.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Explain (in writing) how to see \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) on the graph of an equation of the form \\(y=a\\cdot b^x\\). </li>\n<li> Interpret \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) given equations of the form \\(y=a\\cdot b^x\\) and a context of exponential growth. </li>\n<li> Write an equation of the form of \\(y=a\\cdot b^x\\) to represent a quantity \\(a\\) that changes by a growth factor \\(b\\). </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li> Explain the connections between an equation and a graph that represents exponential growth. </li>\n<li> Write and interpret an equation that represents exponential growth. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<colgroup>\n<col>\n<col>\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>A9(A) determine the domain and range of exponential functions of the form \\(f(x)=ab^x\\) and represent the domain and range using inequalities;</p>\n<p>A9(B) interpret the meaning of the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in exponential functions of the form \\(f(x)=ab^x\\) in real-world problems;</p>\n<p>A9(C) write exponential functions in the form \\(f(x)=ab^x\\) (where \\(b\\) is a rational number) to describe problems arising from mathematical and real-world situations, including growth and decay;</p>\n<p>A9(D) graph exponential functions that model growth and decay and identify key features, including \\(y\\)-intercept and asymptote, in mathematical and real-world problems; and</p>\n<p>A9(B) interpret the meaning of the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in exponential functions of the form \\(f(x)=ab^x\\) in real-world problems;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 5.4.1: Exponent Rules </li>\n<li> 5.4.2: Zero Exponent Rule\n        <ul>\n<li> 5.4.2: Self Check </li>\n<li> 5.4.2: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> 5.4.3: Exponential Change: The Growth Factor\n        <ul>\n<li> 5.4.3: Self Check </li>\n<li> 5.4.3: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> 5.4.4: Graphing Exponential Expressions\n        <ul>\n<li> 5.4.4: Self Check </li>\n<li> 5.4.4: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> 5.4.5: Interpret the Growth Factor of the Equation </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 5.4.6: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<p>None</p>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<p>Acquire devices that can run Desmos (recommended) or other graphing technology as an optional tool for students.</p>\n<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson.
