They don&rsquo;t yet have a name for this new pattern of change, but they recognize that it is neither linear nor exponential and that the graph is unlike the graph of an exponential function.</p>\n<p>Students make sense of this new kind of relationship in a geometric context and describe it in concrete and qualitative ways. Though some students may choose to represent the relationships with calculations or with expressions, these are not required or emphasized in the lesson. Students will have many opportunities to reason symbolically about quadratic patterns in upcoming lessons.</p>\n<p>Technology isn&rsquo;t required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate tools to solve problems, so consider making technology available.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Describe (orally and in writing) a relationship that increases and then decreases when represented by a graph. </li>\n  <li> Given an interesting context, create drawings, tables, and graphs that represent a quadratic relationship. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li> Create drawings, tables, and graphs that represent the area of a garden. </li>\n  <li> Recognize a situation represented by a graph that increases and then decreases. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>A7(A) graph quadratic functions on the coordinate plane and use the graph to identify key attributes, if possible, including \\(x\\)-intercept, \\(y\\)-intercept, zeros, maximum value, minimum values, vertex, and the equation of the axis of symmetry.</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Foundational: Lesson provides foundational content necessary for students to be able to perform this TEKS in later lessons.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 7.1.1: Noticing New Patterns of Change </li>\n  <li> 7.1.2: The Relationship Between Length and Area </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> 7.1.2: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 7.1.2: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 7.1.3: Plotting Measurements </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> 7.1.3: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 7.1.3: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 7.1.4: The Input and Output of a Function </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 7.1.5: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li> Graph paper </li>\n  <li> Calculators </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<p>Graph paper is optional for the activity &ldquo;The Relationship Between Length and Area.&rdquo;</p>\n<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson. Encourage students to look for these words and notice their use and meanings. </li>\n  <li> Encourage students to use key vocabulary words in &ldquo;math talk&rdquo; and their written and oral explanations. </li>\n  <li> Utilize a word wall.
