It is not, so the answer is no.)</li>\n        <li>&ldquo;How can we use the graph of&nbsp;<span>\\( y=450-20x \\)</span>&nbsp;to answer the second question?&rdquo; (Find the point on the graph where the&nbsp;<span>\\( y \\)</span>-value is 150, and see what the&nbsp;<span>\\( x \\)</span>-value is.)</li>\n        <li>&ldquo;On the graph for the first situation, what does the point&nbsp;<span>\\( (15, 3000) \\)</span>&nbsp;mean?&rdquo; (After 15 weeks, there is&nbsp;<span>$</span>3,000 in the bank account.)</li>\n        <li>&ldquo;Is that ordered pair a solution to the equation&nbsp;<span>\\( y=475+125x \\)</span>? How can we tell?&rdquo; (No. The point&nbsp;<span>\\( (15, 3000) \\)</span>&nbsp;is above the graph, not on the graph. After 15 weeks, there is less than&nbsp;<span>$</span>3,000 in the account.)</li>\n        <li>&ldquo;Is&nbsp;<span>\\( (25, -50) \\)</span>&nbsp;a solution to the equation&nbsp;<span>\\( y=450-20x \\)</span>? Why or why not?&rdquo; (No. The point is not on the graph. A negative&nbsp;<span>\\( y \\)</span>-value also has no meaning in this situation. The point&nbsp;<span>\\( (25, -50) \\)</span>&nbsp;means that after 25 minutes, there are &minus;50 gallons of water in the tank, which doesn&rsquo;t make sense.)</li>\n        <li>&ldquo;In general, how can a graph helps us find solutions to two-variable equations?&rdquo; (Any point on the graph of the equation is a solution to that equation.)</li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>"
