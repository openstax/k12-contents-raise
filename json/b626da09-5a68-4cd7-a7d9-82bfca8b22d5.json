You will construct quadratic functions to represent projectile motions, objects that are launched directly upward. Working through the activities, you will discover that gravity affects the speed of a projectile, and the linear model will need to be represented differently to adjust for the change.</p>\n<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Create quadratic functions and graphs that represent a situation. </li>\n<li> Relate the vertex of a graph and the zeros of a function to a situation. </li>\n<li> Know that the domain of a function can depend on the situation it represents. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 7.6.1: Using Linear Functions to Describe Constant Speed </li>\n<li> 7.6.2: The Force of Gravity Change in Quadratic Functions </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 7.6.2: Self Check&nbsp; </li>\n<li> 7.6.2: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 7.6.3: Using Quadratic Functions to Describe Height </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 7.6.3: Self Check&nbsp; </li>\n<li> 7.6.3: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 7.6.4: Interpreting Graphs of Quadratic Functions </li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li> 7.6.5: Practice </li>\n<li> 7.6.6: Lesson Summary</li>\n</ul>"
