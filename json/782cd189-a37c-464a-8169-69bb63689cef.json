In a previous lesson, they saw that a function \\(f\\) defined by \\(f(t)=240(\\frac13)^t\\) represents the area of algae in square yards after \\(t\\)<em>&nbsp;</em>weeks of treatment. Discuss how the equation could be used to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>produce a graph.</li>\n  <li>find the area of the algae 6 weeks after treatment.</li>\n  <li>find out when the area of the algae would drop below 10 square yards.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ask students what \\(f(1)=80\\) and \\(f(2)=\\frac{80}{3}\\) mean in this context. To reiterate the importance of choosing an appropriate graphing window, ask students to give examples of a graphing window that would be appropriate (or inappropriate) for this function. Time permitting, demonstrate the outcomes of their suggestions using graphing technology.</p>"
