When solving by graphing, the graphs of the equations are the same line. When solving by substitution or elimination, you end up with an equation, such as \\(4x = 4x\\), that is always true no matter what value is used.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <li>2.6.2: Systems of Linear Equations with No Solution</li>\n  <ul>\n    <li>In this activity, you analyzed a system of equations that has no solution. This means there are no values that make both equations in the system true. When solving by graphing, the graphs of the equations are parallel lines that never intersect. When solving by substitution or elimination, you end up with an equation, such as \\(0 = 24\\), that is never true.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <li>2.6.2: Self Check</li>\n  <li>2.6.3: Sorting Systems of Equations Based on Number of Solutions </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li>In this activity, you solved many different systems of equations in order to sort which systems had one solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solution.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <li>2.6.3: Self Check&nbsp; </li>\n  <li>2.6.4: Writing Consistent and Inconsistent Systems of Equations</li>\n  <ul>\n    <li>In this activity, you wrote new systems of equations to have one solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solution. By writing new systems of equations from each category, you demonstrated an awareness of the characteristics of each type of system.</li>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>2.6.5: Practice</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span lang=\"EN\">Checking In </span></h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-content-id=\"91284244-0365-431e-8638-95dc149f9dce\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <!--Q1-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-content-id=\"75e5a298-1550-4997-828b-e238e841dcaa\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n      <p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n      <p>Correct!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n      <p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!----------------- Must be included at the bottom of page for dropdown to work ------------>\n  <!--Do not edit below line.-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n</div>"
