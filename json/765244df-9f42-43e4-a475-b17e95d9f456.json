Explain how you know.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Graph of a function on grid, origin O. Horizontal axis, time in hours, from 0 to 8 by 1's. Vertical axis, chemical in milligrams, from 0 to 1,200 by 200's.&lt;br&gt; Labeled plotted coordinates as follows: 0 comma 1,000, 1 comma 600, 2 comma 360, with 6 additional points plotted following a similar trend.\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/6067169e5114ec7c6decefb23c92843d3d582b07\"></p>\n<p>The graph does seem to have the shape of exponential decay. To confirm if the chemical in the patient is decaying exponentially, you can find the growth factor. Since terms are usually multiplied by the growth factor, you can divide consecutive terms to see if there is the same growth factor each time.</p>\n<p>Since \\(\\frac{600}{1000}=\\frac{360}{600}=\\frac{6}{10}\\), the growth factor is \\(\\frac{6}{10}\\). Therefore, it is decaying exponentially, and the equation is \\(y = 1000 (\\frac{6}{10})^x\\), where \\(y\\) is the amount of chemical in mg in the patient and \\(x\\) is the time in hours.</p>\n<h4>Try It: More Exponential Models</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"Reveal1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-content\">\n    <p>The following table represents the number of people who have read a book.

If each set of consecutive terms has the same ratio, the relationship is exponential. In this situation, dividing consecutive terms results in \\(\\frac{600}{300}=\\frac{1200}{600}=\\frac{2400}{1200}=2\\). Therefore, the situation represents exponential growth and can also be represented by the equation \\(y= 300(2)^x\\), where \\(y\\) is the number of people who have read a book and \\(x\\) is the number of months.</p>\n</div>"
