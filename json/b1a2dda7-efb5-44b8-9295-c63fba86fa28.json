The variables are related since cities with more snow plows will probably also have high sales of mittens compared to places with fewer snow plows. The climate, number of people living in the city, and amount of snow all affect both of these variables. A city having extra snow plows would not cause people to buy more mittens, nor would the reverse happen.\n                </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!-- End Question 1-->\n<!-- Begin Question2-->\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-content\">\n<p>2.
