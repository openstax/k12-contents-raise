During this activity, you had an opportunity to use language precisely and to hear how you use terminology and talk about characteristics of items in comparison to one another.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>3.4.2: Recognizing Differences in Scatter Plots<ul>\n<li>In this activity, you were given cards displaying scatter plots of data that could be fit by linear models with varying accuracy. As you worked, you began to recognize differences in scatter plots, lines of best fit, and \\(r\\)-values, and the connection to the correlation coefficient.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>3.4.2: Self Check</li>\n<li>3.4.3: Matching Correlation Coefficients<ul>\n<li>In this activity, you gained a better understanding of correlation coefficients by taking turns with a partner to match scatter plots and correlation coefficients. You had a chance to explain your thinking and critique the reasoning of others.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>3.4.3: Self Check</li>\n<li>3.4.4: Using Correlation Coefficient to Determine Best Fit<ul>\n<li>In this activity, you determined the information a correlation coefficient tells you about the data in a scatter plot.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After these activities, you completed the following<strong> practice</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>3.4.5: Practice</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Checking In&nbsp;</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<!--Q1-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n<p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<p>Correct!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!----------------- Must be included at the bottom of page for dropdown to work ------------>\n<!--Do not edit below line.-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n</div>"
