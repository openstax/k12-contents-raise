At this point, students don't yet know about complex numbers or that squaring a complex number produces a negative number. Consequently, for now we can just say that there is no number (with a silent \"that you know about yet\") that can be squared to get a negative number.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Display one problem at a time. Give students quiet think time for each problem and ask them to give a signal when they have an answer and an explanation. Keep all problems displayed throughout the talk. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>Decide whether each statement is true or false.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n<li>3 is the only solution to \\(x^2&minus;9=0\\).</li>\n</ol>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> True </li>\n<li> False </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> False. There are two solutions because there are two numbers that can be squared to get 9. Both 3 and &ndash;3 are possible solutions.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n<li>A solution to \\(x^2+25=0\\) is &ndash;5.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> True </li>\n<li> False </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> False. There is no solution to \\(x^2+25=0\\) because no real number can be squared to get &ndash;25.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\">\n<li>\\(x(x&minus;7)=0\\) has two solutions.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> True </li>\n<li> False </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> True. There are two factors, 0 and 7, that could make the product of the expression 0.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"4\">\n<li>5 and &ndash;7 are the solutions to \\((x&minus;5)(x+7)=12\\).</li>\n</ol>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> True </li>\n<li> False </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> False. The product of the two factors is not 0, so we cannot solve it using the zero product property (which gives 5 and &ndash;7 as solutions). If we evaluate the expression \\((x&minus;5)(x+7)\\) at those two values, the result will be 0, not 12.</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Ask students to share their response and explanation for each problem. Record and display their responses for all to see. After each explanation, give the class a chance to agree or disagree. To involve more students in the conversation, consider asking:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li>\"Who can restate _______'s reasoning in a different way?\"</li>\n<li>\"Did anyone have the same strategy but would explain it differently?\"</li>\n<li>\"Did anyone solve the problem in a different way?\"</li>\n<li>\"Does anyone want to add on to _______'s strategy?\"</li>\n<li>\"Do you agree or disagree? Why?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Make sure students understand the rationale that makes each statement true or false, as shown in the student response.</p>"
