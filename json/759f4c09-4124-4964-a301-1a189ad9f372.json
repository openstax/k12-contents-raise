Here are two expressions defining the same revenue function.</p>\n<p>\\(p(120 &minus; 4p)\\)</p>\n<p>\\(120p &minus; 4p^2\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>According to this model, how high would the ticket price have to be for the theater to make $0 in revenue? Explain your reasoning.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> $30. If \\(p(120 &minus; 4p) = 0\\), then either \\(p = 0\\) or \\(120 &minus; 4p = 0\\). If the latter is a true equation, \\(p\\) must be 30.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n  <li>What equation can you write to find out what ticket price(s) would allow the theater to make $600 in revenue?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(p(120&minus;4p) = 600\\) or \\(120p &minus; 4p^2 = 600\\)</p>"
