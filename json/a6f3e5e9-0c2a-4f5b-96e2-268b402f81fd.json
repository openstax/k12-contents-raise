Students use the given data to calculate a rebound factor and use it to write a function that models the relationship between number of bounces and bounce heights. They then use the function to answer questions about the ball and its bounces.</p>\n<p>Students also think about the domain of the function and address the fact that this is a discrete context, i.e., it does not make sense to examine \\(\\frac23\\) of a bounce, so the graphs should not be continuous.</p>\n<h4> Launch</h4>\n<h5> Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n<div>\n  <p>Activate or supply background knowledge about discrete and continuous contexts. The number of bounces is counted every time the ball hits the floor. If a student asks about \\(1\\frac12\\) bounces, clarify that would be measuring the time since the ball had been released, not the number of bounces; a &ldquo;bounce&rdquo; is the event of hitting the floor and changing direction.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>The table shows some heights of a ball after a certain number of bounces.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"154\">\n    <col width=\"133\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>bounce number</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>height in centimeters</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>0</p>\n      </td>\n      <td></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>1</p>\n      </td>\n      <td></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>2</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>73.5</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>3</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>51.5</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>4</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>36</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<ol>\n  <li> Is this ball more or less bouncy than the tennis ball in activity 5.11.2, which has the equation \\(h=150 \\cdot (0.53)^n\\)? Explain or show your reasoning. <br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> This ball is more bouncy. Each bounce of this ball reaches a height that is about 0.7 times that of the previous bounce \\((51.5 \\div 73.5 \\approx 0.7)\\). The tennis ball in the earlier task loses about half of its height with each bounce.\n  </li>\n  <br>\n  <li> From what height was the ball dropped? Explain or show your reasoning. Remember your units! <br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> 150 centimeters; \\(73.5 \\div 0.7=105\\) and \\(105 \\div 0.7=150\\).\n  </li>\n  <br>\n  <li> Write an equation that represents the bounce height of the ball, \\(h\\), in centimeters after \\(n\\) bounces. <br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> \\(9h=150 \\cdot (0.7)^n\\)\n  </li>\n  <br>\n  <li> Which graph would more appropriately represent the equation for \\(h\\): Graph A or Graph B? Explain your reasoning. <br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> Graph B is more appropriate. Only whole-number \\(n\\) values make sense in this context. We cannot have bounce number 3.4, for example.<br>\n    <br>\n    <ol type=\"A\">\n      <li><img alt=\"Graph of a function on grid, origin O.

Explain your reasoning. <br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> No, the height of this ball after any given bounce will not be lower than that of the tennis ball because they were dropped from the same height and this ball has a greater rebound factor, so it will always bounce up to a higher point than the tennis ball.\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>\n<p>If students struggle to make sense of the graph, remind them that the horizontal axis depicts the number of bounces, not the height of the ball or time. Although height and time are continuous, the number of bounces is discrete.</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Invite students to share how they decided on the bounciness of the balls and to reflect on their reasoning process:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>&ldquo;How are the data here different from the data in the first activity?&rdquo; (In this case, the successive quotients are very close to the same value, making the choice of rebound factor more straightforward.) </li>\n  <li>&ldquo;When working with the table, how is calculating the missing value in the row above a given value different from calculating a missing value in the row below?&rdquo; (To find the missing value in the row above, we need to divide by the rebound factor rather than multiply.) </li>\n  <li>&ldquo;In the final question, why are both the initial height and the bounciness important?&rdquo; (The value of \\(h\\) is found by multiplying the initial height by the rebound factor \\(n\\) times, so both values matter.) </li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>\n<div>\n  <p>Use this routine to help students reflect on their reasoning process in deciding on the bounciness of the balls. Before the whole-class discussion, arrange students in groups of 2. Provide the following sentence frames as partners share their ideas: &ldquo;In the table, I noticed that . . .&rdquo;; &ldquo;I interpreted the successive quotients to mean . . .&rdquo;; or &ldquo;The equation helped determine the bounciness by . . . .&rdquo; This will help students make sense of exponential decay through discussing the ball-bouncing situation with a partner.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3> 5.11.4: Self Check&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n        <p>The population of deer in a forest is divided in half every decade.
