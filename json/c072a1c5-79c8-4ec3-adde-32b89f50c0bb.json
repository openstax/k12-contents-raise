How does this change affect the vertex of the graph?\" (It moves the graph \\(p\\) units up. The \\(x\\)-coordinate of the vertex is the same but the \\(y\\)-coordinate increases by \\(p\\).) </li>\n  <li> \"Suppose we replace the \\(x^2\\) in \\(y=x^2\\) with \\((x+q)^2\\), where \\(q\\) is a positive number. How does that change the vertex of the graph?\" (It shifts the graph \\(q\\) units to the left. The vertex is now \\((-q,0)\\).) </li>\n  <li> \"Suppose we replace \\(x^2\\) in \\(y=x^2\\) with \\((x+q)^2\\), where \\(q\\) is a negative number, and then add \\(p\\), also a negative number. How is the vertex of the graph representing \\(y=(x+q)^2+p\\) different than that of \\(y=x^2\\)?\" (Its vertex is shifted \\(q\\) units to the right and \\(p\\) units down.) </li>\n  <li> \"What is the vertex of the graph representing \\(y=-x^2&minus;9\\)? Does the graph open up or down?\" (\\((0,-9)\\). It opens down, due to the negative coefficient of \\(x^2\\).) </li>\n  <li> \"What equation will translate the graph so that its vertex is at \\((-5,2)\\) but it still opens down?\" (\\(y=-(x+5)^2+2\\)) </li>\n</ul>"
