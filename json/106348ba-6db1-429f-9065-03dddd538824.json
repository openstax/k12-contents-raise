While <span class=\"os-raise-ib-tooltip\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\" data-store=\"glossary-tooltip\">correlation</span> used to describe the strength of the relationship between variables, a <span class=\"os-raise-ib-tooltip\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\" data-store=\"glossary-tooltip\">causal relationship</span> means that a change in one of the variables actually causes a change in the other variable.</p>\n<p>Describe a pair of variables with each condition.

Look through news articles or\n      advertisements for claims of causation or correlation. Find 2 or 3 claims\n      and read or watch the articles or the advertisements.

Claim 2: They analyzed the number of antioxidants in chocolate as\n          compared to fruit. Claim 3: No evidence was provided other than that it\n          seemed to work for some people.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Claim 1: There appears to be\n          evidence for correlation because there was a control group, and the blood\n          pressure was taken before and after drinking tea. However, there was no\n          mention of how the groups were randomized or selected, so I am not sure\n          if there is evidence for causation. Claim 2: The only evidence\n          provided is the quantity of antioxidants chocolate contains, so a study would\n          need to be done on antioxidants and health to show correlation or\n          causation. Claim 3: There is no evidence for correlation or causation\n          because only a testimonial is provided.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\" data-wait-for-event=\"eventShowMore1\">\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-content\">\n    2.
