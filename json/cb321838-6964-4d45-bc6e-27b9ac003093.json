For each student who does community service, the club earns $5. There are 12 students in the club.</p>\n<p>The total dollar amount earned, \\(E\\), is a function of the number of members who perform community service, \\(n\\).</p>\n<ol>\n<li> Is 5 a possible input value? Why or why not? </li>\n<li> Is 24 a possible output value? Why or why not? </li>\n<li> Describe the domain of this function. </li>\n<li> Describe the range of this function.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Student Responses</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\\(n=5\\) is possible. It means that 5 students perform community service. </li>\n<li> No, 24 is not possible as an output value. An output value has to be a multiple of 5. </li>\n<li> All integers from 0 to 12</li>\n<li> Multiples of 5 from 0 to 60</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>\n<h5>More Chances</h5>\n<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>"
