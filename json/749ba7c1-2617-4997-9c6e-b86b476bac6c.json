They evaluate the function seen earlier \\((d=16t^2)\\) at a non-integer input, and then build a new function to represent the distance from the ground of a falling object \\(t\\) seconds after it is dropped. To find a new expression that describes the height of the object, students reason repeatedly about the height of the object at different times and look for regularity in their reasoning.</p>\n<p>The number 576 is chosen as the height (in feet) from which the object is dropped to make it more apparent for students that the values in the two tables (distance fallen and distance from ground) record distances measured from opposite ends. (Any value of at a whole-number \\(t\\)&nbsp;<span>could work. In this case, \\(t=6\\) is selected.)</span></p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of two, and suggest that they check in with each other after trying each question. To facilitate peer discussion, consider displaying sentence stems or questions that students could use, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> &ldquo;Why do you think the object will have fallen that distance in 0.5 seconds?&rdquo; </li>\n  <li> &ldquo;How do you think the values in the first table are changing? What about in the second table?&rdquo; </li>\n  <li> &ldquo;How are the two tables alike? How are they different?&rdquo; </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>Galileo Galilei, an Italian scientist, and other medieval scholars studied the motion of free-falling objects. The law they discovered can be expressed by the equation \\(d=16t^2\\), which gives the distance fallen in feet as a function of time, \\(t\\), in seconds.</p>\n<p>An object is dropped from a height of 576 feet.</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>How many feet does it fall in 0.5 seconds?<br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>4\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n  <li>To find out where the object is the first few seconds after it was dropped, Elena and Diego created different tables.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Elena&rsquo;s table:</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"231\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"85\">\n    <col width=\"77\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" width=\"99\">\n        <p><strong>Time (seconds)</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" width=\"100\">\n        <p><strong>Distance fallen (feet)</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>0</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>0</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>1</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>16</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>2</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>64</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>3</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\"></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>4</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\"></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>\\(t\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\"></td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p>Diego&rsquo;s table:</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"85\">\n    <col width=\"121\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" width=\"118\">\n        <p><strong>Time (seconds)</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" width=\"119\">\n        <p><strong>Distance from the ground (feet)</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>0</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>576</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>1</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>560</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>2</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>512</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>3</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\"></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>4</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\"></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>t</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\"></td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<ol>\n  <ol type=\"a\">\n    <li> How are the two tables alike?&nbsp; <br>\n      <br>\n      <strong>Answer:</strong> They both have time in seconds and distance in feet as the two quantities being measured.

Ask questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> &ldquo;How did you complete the missing values in the first table?&rdquo; (Substituting 3 and 4 for \\(t\\) in \\(16t^2\\) gives the distances fallen after 3 and 4 seconds.) </li>\n  <li> &ldquo;What about those in the second table?&rdquo; (The distance from the ground is 576 minus the distance fallen, so we can use the values for \\(t=3\\) and \\(t=4\\) from the first table to calculate the values in the second table.) </li>\n  <li> &ldquo;Why do the values in the first table increase and those in the second table decrease?&rdquo; (The distance from the top of the building increases as the object falls farther and farther from it. The distance from the ground decreases as the object falls closer and closer to it.) </li>\n  <li> &ldquo;The expression representing the distance fallen shows \\(16t^2\\), and the other shows \\(576-16t^2\\). Why is that?&rdquo; (In the first function, the distance fallen, measured from where the object is dropped, will always be positive. In the second function, what&rsquo;s measured is the height from the ground, so the distance fallen needs to be subtracted from the height of the building.) </li>\n  <li> &ldquo;If we graph the two equations that represent distance fallen and distance from the ground over time, what would the graphs look like? Try sketching the graphs.&rdquo; </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Display graphs that represent the two functions and make sure students can interpret them. For example, they should see that the \\(y\\)-intercept of each graph corresponds to the starting value of each function before the object is dropped.</p>\n<p>They should also notice that the difference in distance between successive seconds gets larger in both cases, hence the curving graphs. (If the differences were constant, the graphs would have been straight lines.)</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Graph with x-axis labeled time in seconds and y-axis labeled distance fallen in feet.\" height=\"305\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/2d0ccb37bd12cef6c2260ff9ae6a94a190371d0f\" width=\"315\"></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Graph with x-axis labeled with time in seconds and y-axis with distance above the ground in feet.\" height=\"305\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/2cd4885abefe2984476e859b4087f4cf2b2cfa37\" width=\"313\"></p>\n<p>Display the embedded applet for all to see.
