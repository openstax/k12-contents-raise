In creating a model of the data, students are modeling with mathematics.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This activity works best when each student has access to devices that can run Desmos or other graphing technology because the level of precision is important. If students don&rsquo;t have individual access, projecting the Desmos graph is helpful during the synthesis.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Note that students may need a quick review of finding slope and \\(y\\)-intercepts from graphs and slope-intercept form as well as a review of finding slope using the slope formula.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Play the video of adding oranges to a box on a scale. You may need to pause the video for students to write down the weights.</p>\n<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n<div>\n  <p><em>Representation: Internalize Comprehension. </em>Begin the activity with concrete or familiar contexts to address the questions about estimation. Ask students to make predictions about similar scenarios that may become more variable as the sample size increases. For example, discussing the predictability of the weight of a box of fruit as a given sample size increases may be a relatable discussion that will encourage students to think about the difference between a grape and a grapefruit.</p>\n  <p><em>Supports accessibility for: Conceptual processing; Memory</em></p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>\n<p>Watch the following video to help you answer the questions below.</p><br>\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" height=\"275\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/304121358\" title=\"Oranges in a Box\" width=\"550\"></iframe>\n<br>\n<br>\n<ol>\n  <li>Record the weight for the number of oranges in the box from the video.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n  <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n    <colgroup>\n      <col width=\"159\">\n      <col width=\"164\">\n    </colgroup>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td><strong><br>\n          </strong>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>number of oranges</strong></p>\n        </td>\n        <td><strong><br>\n          </strong>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>weight in kilograms</strong></p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3</strong></p>\n        </td>\n        <td><strong><br></strong></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4</strong></p>\n        </td>\n        <td><strong><br></strong></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>5</strong></p>\n        </td>\n        <td><strong><br></strong></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>6</strong></p>\n        </td>\n        <td><strong><br></strong></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>7</strong></p>\n        </td>\n        <td><strong><br></strong></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>8</strong></p>\n        </td>\n        <td><strong><br></strong></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>9</strong></p>\n        </td>\n        <td><strong><br></strong></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>10</strong></p>\n        </td>\n        <td><br></td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</div>\n<p><br></p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta\" data-button-text=\"Graph Your Solution\" data-fire-event=\"section1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-content\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n    <p></p>\n    <ol start=\"2\">\n      <li>Create a scatter plot of the data.</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-prompt\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-desmos-gc\" data-bottom=\"-50\" data-disable-expressions data-equations='[\"(0,0)\"]' data-height=\"500\" data-left=\"-50\" data-right=\"50\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\" data-top=\"50\" data-wait-for-event=\"section1\" data-width=\"600\">\n</div>\n<br>\n<p></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n  <li><span>Draw a line through the data that fits the data well.<br><br></span></li>\n  <li><span>Estimate a value for the slope of the line that you drew.

Many of the additional oranges may be very small or very large and not fit the general trend seen with these 10 oranges. While the estimate from the line is interesting and may be better than a wild guess, it should not be considered a very good estimate.)<br></li>\n  <li>&ldquo;How many oranges did we measure?&rdquo; (10)<br></li>\n  <li>&ldquo;Since we measured 10 oranges, how does that affect your confidence in the estimate for 50 oranges?&rdquo; (It makes me very skeptical that the estimate will be accurate. Although the data may look like a line for this section, there may be very different things happening farther away.)<br></li>\n  <li>&ldquo;How would the scatter plot and linear model change if grapefruits were used instead of oranges?&rdquo; (The weight would be increased for each point, and the slope of the line would be greater.)<br></li>\n  <li>&ldquo;In this case, there might be some meaning attached to the \\(y\\)-intercept. That is not always the case. Why might interpreting the \\(y\\)-intercept not make sense in some situations? Can you think of a situation in which an interpretation of the \\(y\\)-intercept might not make sense?&rdquo; (As you get farther from the collected data, the linear model may not make sense any more. Especially in situations in which the amount of something is approaching zero, very different things can be happening. For example, if we have data about water at temperatures around 60 to 70 degrees, that will be very different from what happens when the temperature is at 0.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<h4>3.1.2: Self Check&nbsp;</h4>\n<p><span><strong><em>Following the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></span><br></p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n  <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n    <colgroup>\n      <col width=\"302\">\n      <col width=\"322\">\n    </colgroup>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td colspan=\"2\">\n          <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>QUESTION:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\">The plot below is a scatter plot of mean temperature in July and mean inches of rain per year for a sample of midwestern cities.

Make the prediction, and discuss whether it is reasonable.</span></li>\n  </ol>\n</ol>\n<p></p>\n<p><span><strong>Solution:</strong></span><br></p>\n<p></p>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n  <li>The number of chirps in the data provided varied from 18.5 to 44. A prediction at 30 chirps per 15 seconds is inside the domain of our data, so it would be interpolation. Using our model:</li>\n</ol>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"editor-indent\">\n  <p>\\(\\begin{array}{rcl}T\\;(30)\\;&amp;=&amp;\\;30\\;+\\;1.2(30)\\\\&amp;=&amp;\\;66\\;degrees\\end{array}\\)&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<p>Based on the data we have, this value seems reasonable.</p><br>\n<ol start=\"2\" type=\"a\">\n  <li>The temperature values varied from 52 to 80.5. Predicting the number of chirps at 40 degrees is extrapolation because 40 is outside the range of our data.
