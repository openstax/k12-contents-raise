In this\n  lesson, students will find the equation of a line given the slope and a point that is not the \\( y \\)-intercept.\n  Point-slope form is new to students. Deriving the formula from the formula for slope can help students see that there\n  is a connection to the slope, which they already know how to find. Allow students to use a graphing calculator or\n  Desmos where appropriate to check their answers. Point out to students that most graphing calculators require the\n  equations to be in slope-intercept form to graph them.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Have students work in pairs. When deriving the formula, watch that students do not distribute&nbsp;\\( m \\) to the \\(\n  x \\)-variables. While students are working, check to see that they are substituting the correct values into the\n  equation. Remind students they can graph a line given a point and the slope by plotting the given point and using the\n  rise over run to find another point. Remind them the rise is the change in \\(y\\) and the run is the change in \\( x \\).\n  For example, a slope of 3 can be written as \\( \\frac{3}{1} \\): the rise is 3, and the run is 1.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>\n<p>What if the point you are given isn&rsquo;t a \\(&nbsp;y&nbsp;\\)-intercept? Point-slope is a great form to use when\n  you are given the slope and any point.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>First, work to derive the point-slope formula by completing the following steps:</p>\n<p>Start with the slope formula as&nbsp;\\( m= \\frac{y-y_1}{x-x_1} \\).</p>\n<p>Step 1: Multiply both sides of the equation by \\( x - x_1 \\).<br></p>\n<p>Step 2: Simplify.<br></p>\n<p>Step 3: Rewrite the equation with the \\(y\\) terms on the left.<br></p>\n<p>With your partner, you will find the equation of the line in point-slope form that goes through the point \\( (3, 4)\n  \\) and has a slope of 2 by answering the following questions.</p>\n<p>1. Use the point and slope to graph the line on a coordinate plane.</p>\n<p>2. Write the equation for point-slope form.<br></p>\n<p>3. Name the point \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) and the slope, \\( m \\).<br></p>\n<p>4. Substitute the point and slope into the point-slope form.<br></p>\n<p>5. Now, with your partner, each solve for \\(y\\) to write the equation in slope-intercept form. Compare your answers\n  for any possible errors. Come to an agreement on your equation. You may also choose to graph the line on a coordinate plane using a graphing calculator or Desmos with your final equation to check your answer.<br></p>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<p><span>Step 1: \\( m(x-x_1)=\\left(\\frac{y-y_1}{x-x_1}\\right)(x-x_1) \\)</span></p>\n<p><span>Step 2:&nbsp;\\( m(x-x_1)=y-y_1 \\)</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Step 3:&nbsp;\\( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\)</span></p>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-content\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">1.
