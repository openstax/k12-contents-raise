While this strategy is both effective and efficient, the task asks students to decide which function has a greater maximum without graphing in order to encourage them to reason algebraically.</p>\n<p>Monitor for students taking different approaches. Some possible strategies:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Use the factored form of the expression for Performance A to find the \\(x\\)-intercepts. Then, find the midpoint of the two intercepts, identify its \\(x\\)-value, evaluate the expression at that value, and compare the output with the \\(y\\)-value of the vertex of the other graph. </li>\n  <li> Convert the expression representing Performance A to vertex form, identify the vertex, and compare the \\(y\\)-value to that of the vertex on the graph for Performance B. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Give students time to read the task statement and think quietly about how they would go about comparing the two functions. Then, ask them to share their thoughts with their partner before beginning to work on the problem.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>A function \\(A\\), defined by \\(p(600&minus;75p)\\), describes the revenue collected from the sales of tickets for Performance A, a musical.</p>\n<p>The graph represents a function \\(B\\) that models the revenue collected from the sales of tickets for Performance B, a Shakespearean comedy.</p>\n<p><img height=\"215\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/d22a090d7b9a433cd29e770cec9c4f4058d70e5b\" width=\"331\"></p>\n<p>In both functions, \\(p\\) represents the price of one ticket, and both revenues and prices are measured in dollars.</p>\n<p>Without creating a graph of \\(A\\), determine which performance gives the greater maximum revenue when tickets are \\(p\\) dollars each. Explain or show your reasoning.</p>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Performance A.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> The maximum revenue for Performance B is $900 based on the vertex (of a graph) of its graph. For Performance A, the expression \\(p(600&minus;75p)\\) is in factored form, which tells us that the horizontal intercepts are \\((0,0)\\) and \\((8,0)\\). The horizontal coordinate of the vertex is halfway between 0 and 8, which is 4. Substituting 4 for \\(p\\) in \\(p(600&minus;75p)\\) gives 1200, so the vertex is at \\((4,1200)\\). 1200 is greater than 900. </li>\n  <li> The maximum revenue for Performance B is $900 based on the vertex of its graph. The expression \\(p(600&minus;75p)\\) can be rewritten in vertex form (of a quadratic expression): \\(-75(p&minus;4)^2+1200\\), which tells us that the vertex of a graph of the function is at \\((4,1200)\\) and that the maximum revenue is $1200. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4> Video: Comparing Maximums between Quadratics </h4>\n<p>Watch the following video to learn more about comparing maximums between quadratics.</p>\n<video controls=\"true\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" width=\"550\">\n  <source src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/d609275acd34998c8543a11b3df4e14a5a1343e8\">\n  <track default=\"true\" kind=\"captions\" label=\"On\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/0363bf355bdcd6bda581980f50acb0b0f068098e\" srclang=\"en_us\">https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/d609275acd34998c8543a11b3df4e14a5a1343e8\n</video>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Invite previously identified students to share their solutions.
