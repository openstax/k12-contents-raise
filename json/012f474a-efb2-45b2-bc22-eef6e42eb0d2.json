Discuss questions such as:</p>\n<br>\n<ul>\n  <li>&ldquo;In what ways is the relationship between the step number and the number of small squares different from linear functions we&rsquo;ve seen so far?&rdquo; (When one quantity increases by a certain amount, the other quantity does not change by the same amount. The graph relating the two quantities is not a straight line. The rule that relates the two quantities is different from a linear expression.) </li>\n  <li>&ldquo;In what ways is the relationship between the two quantities different from the exponential functions we&rsquo;ve encountered?&rdquo; (When the input increases by an amount, the output does not always change by the same factor. The graph representing this relationship is a curve, but it is different from the graph of an exponential function. Even though there may be an exponent in the expression (for example, \\(n^2\\)), the rule that relates the two quantities is not like exponential expressions we&rsquo;ve seen, where the input was the exponent.) </li>\n  <li>&ldquo;How would you describe &lsquo;quadratic relationship&rsquo; to someone who is unfamiliar with it?&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>"
