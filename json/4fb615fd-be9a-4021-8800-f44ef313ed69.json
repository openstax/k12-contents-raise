In the launched potato situation, what outputs were known?&rdquo; (The potato&rsquo;s heights or distances from the ground.) &ldquo;What inputs did we want to know?&rdquo; (The times at which the potato was at certain heights.) </li>\n  <li>&ldquo;In the framing problem, what was the output that we cared about?&rdquo; (The total area of the framed picture, which was 38 square inches.) &ldquo;What information was the input?&rdquo; (The width of the frame that would produce that total area.) </li>\n  <li>&ldquo;Why might it be helpful to write an equation to represent a problem such as the one about framing?&rdquo; (An equation helps us see the relationship between the quantities in the problem, including those whose values are unknown. We can solve for those values.) </li>\n  <li>&ldquo;In the framing situation, if \\(x\\) represents the width of the frame, in inches, what would a solution to the equation \\((2x + 7)(2x + 4) = 50\\) mean?&rdquo; (The width of the frame would produce a total area of 50 square inches.) </li>\n  <li>&ldquo;Equations such as \\((2x + 7)(2x + 4) = 50\\) and \\(4x^2 + 22x + 28 = 38\\) are called quadratic equations. Why do you think equations like these are described as quadratic?&rdquo; (Each equation has a quadratic expression in it. Each one relates quantities in a quadratic function.) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Quadratic equations will be defined more formally in the next lesson. It is fine and expected that students have an informal or partial understanding of what they are at this point.</p>"
