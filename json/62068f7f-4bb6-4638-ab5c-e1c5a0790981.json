The graph of the equation would have a negative slope because the more almonds Clare bought, the fewer dried figs she could have afforded. Graph A shows that as more almonds are bought, more figs are also bought, which couldn&rsquo;t be true if Clare spent a fixed amount of money.)</li>\n          <li>&ldquo;What does the vertical intercept mean in this situation?&rdquo; (It shows the pounds of dried figs Clare could buy if she bought no almonds.)</li>\n          <li>&ldquo;What is the vertical intercept of the graph? How can we find it?&rdquo; (The vertical intercept is&nbsp;\\( (0,12) \\). One way to find it is to substitute 0 for&nbsp;\\( x \\)&nbsp;and solve for&nbsp;\\( y \\), which gives&nbsp;\\( y=12 \\). Another way is to rearrange the equation into slope-intercept form.)</li>\n          <li>&ldquo;What is the slope of the graph? How can we find it?&rdquo; (The slope is&nbsp;\\( -\\frac23 \\). We can rearrange the equation into slope-intercept form, or we can find the coordinates of another point and calculate the slope.)</li>\n          <li>&ldquo;What does the slope tell us about the almonds and dried figs?&rdquo; (It tells us that for every additional pound of almonds that Clare buys, she could buy&nbsp;\\( \\frac23 \\)&nbsp;fewer pound of dried figs.)</li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"student-summary\">\n      <div class=\"body\">\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>"
