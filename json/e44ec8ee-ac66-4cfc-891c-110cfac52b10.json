In some cases, the relationship between quantities might take a bit of work to figure out, by doing calculations several times or by looking for a pattern.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Here are two examples.</span><br></p>\n<p><span>1. A plane departed from New Orleans and is heading to San Diego. The table shows its distance from New Orleans, \\( x \\), and its distance from San Diego, \\( y \\), at some points along the way.</span></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>miles from New Orleans</strong></td>\n      <td><strong>&nbsp;miles from San Diego</strong></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>100</td>\n      <td>1,500</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>300</td>\n      <td>1,300</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>500</td>\n      <td>1,100</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><br></td>\n      <td>1,020</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>900<br></td>\n      <td>700</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1,450&nbsp;</td>\n      <td>&nbsp;</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\\( x \\)</td>\n      <td>&nbsp;\\( y \\)</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span><br>What is the relationship between the two distances? Do you see any patterns in how each quantity is changing? Can you find out what the missing values are?</span><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Notice that every time the distance from New Orleans increases by some number of miles, the distance from San Diego decreases by the same number of miles, and that the sum of the two values is always 1,600 miles.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The relationship can be expressed with any of these equations:</p>\n<p>\\( x+y=1,600&nbsp;\\)&nbsp;<br><span>\\(&nbsp;y=1,600-x&nbsp;\\)&nbsp;<br></span><span>\\(&nbsp;x=1,600-y \\)</span></p>\n<p>2. A company decides to donate $50,000 to charity. It will select up to 20 charitable organizations, as nominated by its employees. Each selected organization will receive an equal donation amount.</p>\n<p>What is the relationship between the number of selected organizations, \\(n\\), and the dollar amount each of them will receive, \\( d \\)?</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>If 5 organizations are selected, each one receives $10,000.</li>\n  <li>If 10 organizations are selected, each one receives $5,000.</li>\n  <li>If 20 organizations are selected, each one receives $2,500.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do you notice a pattern here?&nbsp;10,000 is \\( \\frac{50,000}{5} \\), 5,000 is \\( \\frac{50,000}{10} \\), and 2,500 is \\( \\frac{50,000}{20} \\).</p>\n<p>We can generalize that the amount each organization receives is 50,000 divided by the number of selected organizations, or&nbsp;\\( d=\\frac{50,000}{n} \\).</p>\n<h4>Try It: Finding Relationships between Quantities</h4>\n<p><span>A local business is going to hand out $20,000 in scholarships to students at local high schools.</span></p>\n<p>What is the relationship between the number of students, \\( s \\), and the dollar amount each student will receive, \\( d \\)?</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><span>If there are 2 students selected, each student will receive $10,000.</span></li>\n  <li><span>If there are 5 students selected, each student will receive $4,000.</span></li>\n  <li><span>If there are 10 students selected, each student will receive $2,000</span></li>\n  <li><span>If there are 20 students selected, each student will receive $1,000.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"eventShow1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-content\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-prompt\">\n    <p>Write down your answer.

Know that you learn more from wrong answers than from right answers! Wrong answers help us find flaws in our thinking. Take a minute to think about <em>why</em> you got the question wrong.
