This\n          activity illustrates that idea graphically. Students see that the\n          coordinates of all points on the graphs are pairs of values that make\n          the equation true, which means that they are all solutions to the\n          equation.</p>\n        <p>They also see\n          that because the given equation models the quantities and constraints in\n          a situation, not all points on the graph are meaningful. For example,\n          only positive <span>\\( x \\)-</span> or <span>\\( y \\)-</span>values\n          on the graph (that is, only points in the first quadrant of the\n          coordinate plane) have meanings in this context because almonds and figs\n          cannot have negative values for their weight.</p>\n        <p>During the\n          activity, look for students who perform numerical computations\n          straightaway and those who first write a variable equation and then use\n          it to answer the first two questions.</p>\n      </div>\n      <h3>Launch</h3>\n      <div>\n        <p>Arrange students\n          in groups of 2 and provide access to calculators. Give students a few\n          minutes of quiet work time and then time to share their responses with a\n          partner.</p>\n        <h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>\n        <div>\n          <p><em>Reading, Listening, Conversing: MLR6 Three Reads. </em>Use\n            this routine to support reading comprehension of this word problem. Use\n            the first read to orient students to the situation. Ask students to\n            describe what the situation is about without using numbers (Clare\n            purchased some snacks: salted almonds and dried figs). Use the second\n            read to identify quantities and relationships. Ask students what can be\n            counted or measured without focusing on the values. Listen for, and\n            amplify, the important quantities that vary in relation to each other in\n            this situation: the cost per pound of each snack food, the amount of\n            each snack food purchased, and the total amount of money spent before\n            tax. After the third read, ask students to brainstorm possible\n            strategies to determine the amount of one snack food purchased if the\n            amount of the other snack food is known. This helps students connect the\n            language in the word problem and the reasoning needed to solve the\n            problem.<br><em>Design Principle(s): Support sense-making\n            </em>\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <p><br></p>\n        <h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n        <div>\n          <p><em>Representation: Internalize Comprehension.</em>\n            Provide appropriate reading accommodations and supports to ensure\n            student access to written directions, word problems, and other\n            text-based content. <br><em>Supports accessibility for: Language; Conceptual processing\n            </em>\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <p><br></p>\n      </div>\n      <h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>\n      <div>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <p>To\n                get snacks for a class trip, Clare went to the &ldquo;bulk&rdquo; section of the\n                grocery store, where she could buy any quantity of a product and the\n                prices are usually good.</p>\n              <p>Clare purchased some salted almonds at <span>$</span>6 a pound and some dried figs at <span>$</span>9 per pound.

Discuss questions such as:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>&ldquo;What does the point \\( (10, 3) \\) mean in this situation?&rdquo; (Clare purchased 10 pounds of almonds and 3 pounds of figs.)</li>\n          <li>&ldquo;Is that a possible combination of pounds of\n            figs and almonds? Why or why not?&rdquo; (No. It doesn&rsquo;t lie on the graph.\n            Also, if Clare bought 10 pounds of almonds and 3 pounds of figs, it\n            would cost her $87, not $75.)</li>\n          <li>&ldquo;From the graph, it looks like \\( (7, 3.5) \\)\n            might be a solution, but it is hard to know for sure.
