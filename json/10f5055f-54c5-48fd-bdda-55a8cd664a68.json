Using the Quotient Property for exponents, students will first learn to divide monomials by monomials, as well as larger polynomials by monomials. They will use long division to divide different polynomials by binomials. Students will learn an efficient method to divide a polynomial by a binomial of the form \\(x - c\\) called synthetic division. Students will divide polynomial functions using the skills they have learned in the lesson. They will learn the Remainder Theorem and Factor Theorem, which they can use to check their work while dividing polynomials.</p>\n<h4> Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Divide by monomials by simplifying divisible terms and using the Quotient Property for exponents. </li>\n  <li> Use long division to divide polynomials. </li>\n  <li> Use synthetic division to divide polynomials by binomials of the form \\(x - c\\). </li>\n  <li> Divide polynomial functions using the methods learned in this lesson. </li>\n  <li> Use the Remainder Theorem to determine the remainder of a polynomial division expression. </li>\n  <li> Use the Factor Theorem to determine if a binomial is a factor of a polynomial. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li> Divide monomials. </li>\n  <li> Divide a polynomial by a monomial. </li>\n  <li> Divide polynomials using long division. </li>\n  <li> Divide polynomials using synthetic division. </li>\n  <li> Divide polynomial functions. </li>\n  <li> Use the Remainder and Factor Theorems. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4> Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>A10(C) determine the quotient of a polynomial of degree one and polynomial of degree two when divided by a polynomial of degree one and polynomial of degree two when the degree of the divisor does not exceed the degree of the dividend;</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 6.3.1: Dividing by Monomials </li>\n  <li> 6.3.2: Dividing Polynomials Using Long Division </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> 6.3.2: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 6.3.2: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 6.3.3: Dividing Polynomials Using Synthetic Division </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> 6.3.3: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 6.3.3: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 6.3.4: Dividing Polynomial Functions and the Remainder Theorem </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> 6.3.4: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 6.3.4: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 6.3.5: Using the Factor Theorem </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 6.3.6: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>Paper and pencil </li>\n</ul>\n<h4> Required Preparation</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>None </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson.
