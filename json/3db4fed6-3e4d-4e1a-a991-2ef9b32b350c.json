To analyze the patterns, students generate tables of values, write expressions, and create graphs. They also encounter the term <em>quadratic expression</em> and learn that a quadratic relationship can be written using an expression with a squared term.</p>\n<p>Discerning and extending different patterns of change prompt students to look for and make use of structure. Generating tables of values and generalizing the relationships prompts students to express regularity in repeated reasoning.</p>\n<p>Technology isn&rsquo;t required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate tools to solve problems. Consider making technology available, in case it is requested.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Comprehend that a &ldquo;quadratic relationship&rdquo; can be expressed with a squared term. </li>\n<li> Describe (orally and in writing) a pattern of change associated with a quadratic relationship. </li>\n<li> Determine and explain (orally and in writing) whether a visual pattern represents a linear, exponential, or quadratic relationship. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li> Describe how a pattern is growing. </li>\n<li> Tell whether a pattern is growing linearly, exponentially, or quadratically. </li>\n<li> Explain that an expression with a squared term is called quadratic. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<colgroup>\n<col>\n<col>\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><p><strong>TEKS</strong></p></td>\n<td><p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><p>A7(A) graph quadratic functions on the coordinate plane and use the graph to identify key attributes, if possible, including \\(x\\)-intercept, \\(y\\)-intercept, zeros, maximum value, minimum values, vertex, and the equation of the axis of symmetry.</p></td>\n<td><p>Foundational: Lesson provides foundational content necessary for students to be able to perform this TEKS in later lessons.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 7.2.1: Squares in a Geometric Pattern </li>\n<li> 7.2.2: Constant and Exponential Change </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 7.2.2: Self Check </li>\n<li> 7.2.2: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 7.2.3: Quadratic Expressions </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 7.2.3: Self Check </li>\n<li> 7.2.3: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 7.2.4: Quadratic Relationships </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 7.2.5: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<p>None</p>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<p>None</p>\n<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson.
