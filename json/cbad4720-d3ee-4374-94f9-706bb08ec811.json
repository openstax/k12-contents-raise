Students have just seen how linear functions change by equal differences over equal intervals, and exponential functions change by equal factors over equal intervals, so they are likely to look for these features. They investigate the growth of three city populations over a period of 50 years. The data is real and thus not exactly linear or exponential. But the cities are carefully selected so that one population can be approximated well with a linear function, one can be approximated well with an exponential function, and one is neither linear nor exponential.</p>\n<p>When writing equations to model the populations, a natural variable to use is decades, because the populations are only given each decade. Students can choose to use years, but then finding the growth rate for Austin is problematic. If students get stuck, consider suggesting the use of decades to measure time.</p>\n<p>Once students create their models and make predictions, consider sharing more recent population data so they can check their predictions.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"97\">\n    <col width=\"118\">\n    <col width=\"117\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p><strong>City</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p><strong>2010</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p><strong>2017</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>Paris</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>10,500,000</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>11,000,000</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>Austin</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>790,000</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>950,000</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>Chicago</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>2,700,000</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>2,730,000</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p>Monitor for different strategies as students decide which model to use.

These trends may or may not persist. So the data allows us to make an informed prediction for the population in 2010, 2050, or today but the predictions may not be accurate if conditions in the cities have changed. See the answers to 5 below for some estimates.&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Sample response:&nbsp;\n    <ul>\n      <li> The Paris population is increasing but looks to increase more and more slowly as time goes on.&nbsp; </li>\n      <li> The Austin population is increasing more and more rapidly as time goes on.&nbsp; </li>\n      <li> The Chicago population is decreasing until the decade from 1990 to 2000 when it increases. The rate of decrease from 1950 through 1990 is not constant.&nbsp; <br>\n        <br>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Sample response:&nbsp;\n    <ul>\n      <li> For Paris, a linear model might be appropriate. The successive differences for the populations are 1,100,000, 800,000, 500,000, 600,000, 400,000. While these are not constant, they show the same general trend upward at a little more than 500,000 per year. This variation in differences is large enough that some may decide a linear model is not appropriate. An exponential model for Paris could also be used with a rate of growth, per decade, at about 1.07. This seems less appropriate than the linear model, however, because the amount of growth each decade is not accelerating (which we would expect if it were growing exponentially).&nbsp; </li>\n      <li> For Austin, a linear model is not appropriate because the successive differences are steadily increasing. An exponential model would be appropriate because the successive population quotients, while not all the same, are in a pretty narrow range between 1.36 and 1.42.&nbsp; </li>\n      <li> For Chicago, the population is decreasing for most of the period, but then it increases slightly at the end. The successive differences in the population are not that close to being constant so a linear model is not the best&mdash;we could draw a line connecting the initial and final populations but this overestimates the population for much of the time between 1950 and 2000. An exponentially decreasing model is also not appropriate&mdash;the successive quotients are not far from 1, but this will also fail to capture the growth at the end.&nbsp; <br>\n        <br>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Sample response:&nbsp;<br>\n    <br>\n    <ol type=\"a\">\n      <li><br>\n        <br>\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n    <ul>\n      <li> For Paris, the population (in millions) \\(d\\) decades after 1950, is modeled by \\(f\\) where \\(f(d)=0.7d+6.3\\). </li>\n      <li> For Austin, the population (in hundred thousands) \\(d\\) decades after 1950, is modeled by \\(g\\) where \\(g(d)=1.32(1.38)^d\\). </li>\n      <li> For Chicago, no good linear or exponential model.&nbsp; <br>\n        <br>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <ol start=\"2\" type=\"a\">\n      <li>Paris:<br>\n        <br>\n        <img height=\"276\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/61fcd6b4f3526b59b90622071e563df2b8ade98e\" width=\"411\"><br>\n        <br>\n        &nbsp;Austin:&nbsp;<br>\n        <br>\n        <img height=\"307\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4e9dc7637967f10d4e2e8ee1dd58c2375009abc4\" width=\"397\"><br>\n        <br>\n        Chicago:&nbsp;<br>\n        <br>\n        <img height=\"258\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4ac4d2d810aaca3522e7eecb5eeace68be7030fc\" width=\"416\">\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li>Sample response:&nbsp;<br>\n    <br>\n    <ul>\n      <li> The model for the Paris data fits ok but it's not perfect. While it is not too far off for any of the given decades, there is a trend that indicates that the linear model is probably not the best&mdash;the line consistently underestimates the population for earlier decades and then overestimates the population at the very end. This trend in the residuals indicates that a different model would probably be better.&nbsp; </li>\n      <li> The model for Austin fits the data very well. In fact, it is difficult to tell that the variation in successive quotients for the population each decade is significant (from about 1.36 to about 1.42). Maybe since the graph is only for 5 decades, these differences are not substantial enough to be visible.&nbsp; </li>\n      <li> For Chicago, we can see that the data does not have an exponential shape. We could use a horizontal line, indicating a constant population of about 3,000,000. But while this is never too far off from any of the given data points, it misses the overall trend in the population change.&nbsp; <br>\n        <br>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li> Sample response:&nbsp;<br>\n    <br>\n    <ol type=\"a\">\n      <li> Using \\(d = 6\\) to find the population in 2010 and \\(d = 7.2\\) to find the population in 2022 and \\(d = 10\\) to find the population in 2050.

Possible responses include:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> plotting the points and using a ruler to sketch a line that fits the data well, and then finding an equation for the line </li>\n  <li> finding a line or exponential curve that goes through two of the data points, and then using it to find the slope or the factor of growth </li>\n  <li> finding an average of differences over equal intervals, and then fitting that line through the first data point </li>\n  <li> finding an average of factors of growth over equal intervals, and then fitting an exponential function through the first data point </li>\n</ul>\n<p>If no students chose to plot the data or to test their models using graphing technology, consider demonstrating this to show that the parameters in linear and exponential models can be varied to check the fit of a model. This will help students decide which, if either, is better and also analyze their own models.</p>\n<h5> Support for English Language Learners</h5>\n<div>\n  <p>Conversing: Collect and Display. During the discussion, listen for and collect the language students use to describe linear and exponential situations. Call students&rsquo; attention to language such as &ldquo;successive differences,&rdquo; &ldquo;successive factors or quotients,&rdquo; or key parts of the equation. Write students&rsquo; words and phrases on a visual display and update them throughout the remainder of the lesson. Remind students to borrow language from the display as needed. This will help students compare and contrast linear and exponential models using real-world data.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n<div>\n  <p>Representation: Internalize Comprehension.
