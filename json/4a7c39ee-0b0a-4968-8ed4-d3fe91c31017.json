Students also pay attention to the value that is at the boundary of an inequality and consider whether it is or isn&rsquo;t a solution to an inequality.</span><br></p>\n\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Give students 1&ndash;2 minutes of quiet work time. Follow with a whole-class discussion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement&nbsp;</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Match each inequality to the meaning of a symbol within it.</p>\n<div class=\"imgrid\">\n<div class=\"g--row g--row-1\">\n<div class=\"g--col-1 g--column g--content g--half g--row-1\">\n<ol>\n<li><span class=\"math\">\\( h&gt;50 \\)</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"math\">\\( h \\leq 20 \\)</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"math\">\\( 30 \\geq h \\)</span></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"g--col-2 g--column g--content g--half g--row-1\">\n<ul>\n<li>less than or equal to</li>\n<li>greater than</li>\n<li>greater than or equal to</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Is 25 a solution to any of the inequalities?

Make sure students see that, even though the symbol is read &ldquo;greater than or equal to,&rdquo; it doesn&rsquo;t mean that we&rsquo;re looking for values that are greater than or equal to 30. The statement reads &ldquo;30 is greater than or equal to \\( h \\),&rdquo; which means \\( h \\) must be less than or equal to 30.</p>\n<p>Next, ask students how they know whether each of those numbers (the 50, 20, and 30, or the boundary values) is a solution to the inequality. Emphasize that we can test those boundary values the same way we test other values: by checking if they make the statement true.</p>\n<p>Display these equations in one variable for all to see: \\( h=50 \\), \\( h=20 \\), and \\( 30=h \\). Discuss with students how these equations are different from the inequalities in one variable (aside from the fact that the symbols are different). Highlight the idea that there is only one value that could make each equation true, but there is a range of values that can make each inequality true.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"studentlearning-goals\">\n<ul>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"
