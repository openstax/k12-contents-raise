The work allows them to further develop their understanding of the method when used with rational numbers and to notice common errors. Identifying errors in worked examples is an opportunity to attend to precision and to analyze and critique the reasoning of others.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Display the four equations in the task statement for all to see:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> \\(x^2+14x=-24\\) </li>\n  <li> \\(x^2&minus;10x+16=0\\) </li>\n  <li> \\(x^2+2.4x=-0.8\\) </li>\n  <li> \\(x^2&minus;\\frac{6}{5}x+\\frac{1}{5}=0\\) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of three to four. Assign one equation (or more, depending on time constraints) for each group to solve by completing the square. Once group members agree on the solutions, ask them to look for errors in the worked solution for the same equation (as the one they solved).</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>Here are four equations followed by worked solutions of the equations. Each solution has at least one error.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>Solve the equation \\(x^2+14x=-24\\). Then look at the following worked solution (with errors) and find and describe the error or errors in the worked solution.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\(\\begin{array}{rlr}x^{2}+14 x &amp; =-24 &amp; \\text { Step 1 } \\\\ x^{2}+14 x+28 &amp; =4 &amp; \\text { Step 2 } \\\\ (x+7)^{2} &amp; =4 &amp; \\text { Step 3 } \\\\ x + 7 &amp; =2 &amp; \\text { Step 4 } \\\\ x+7 &amp; =-2 &amp; \\text { Step 5 } \\\\ x &amp; =-5 \\text { and } x=9 &amp; \\text { Step 6 } \\\\ \\end{array} \\) </p>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(x=-2\\) and \\(x=-12\\)</p>\n<p>Error: In Step 2, the number being added, 28, is not a perfect square. It should be 49.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n  <li>Solve the equation \\(x^2&minus;10x+16=0\\).

Step 5 should have -3 on the right side, not -9.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\">\n  <li>Solve the equation \\(x^2+2.4x=-0.8\\). Then look at the following worked solution (with errors) and find and describe the error or errors in the worked solution.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\(\\begin{array}{rlr}x^2+2.4x=-0.8\\;\\;\\text{&nbsp;Step 1}&amp; \\\\ x^2+2.4x+1.44=0.64\\quad\\text{Step 2}&amp; \\\\ (x+1.2)^2=0.64\\quad\\text{Step 3}&amp; \\\\ x+1.2=0.8\\quad\\text{Step 4}&amp; \\\\ x=-0.4\\quad\\text{Step 5}&amp;\\end{array} \\) </p>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(x=-0.4\\) and \\(x=-2\\)</p>\n<p>Error: In Step 4, only the positive square root is written and the negative square root is neglected.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"4\">\n  <li>Solve the equation \\(x^2&minus;\\frac{6}{5}x+\\frac{1}{5}=0\\).

On the left, \\(\\frac{4}{25}\\) is added. On the right, \\(\\frac{9}{25}\\) is added. Or: While \\(\\frac{9}{25}\\) is added on the right side, \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) was only subtracted from the left side. Other explanations may also be accurate.\n</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>To involve more students in the discussion, after each student presents, consider asking students to classify each error by type (not limited to one type per error) and explain their classification. Here are some examples of types of errors:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Careless errors&mdash;for example, writing the wrong number or symbol, repeating the same step twice, leaving out a negative sign, or not following directions. </li>\n  <li> Computational errors&mdash;for example, adding or subtracting incorrectly or putting a decimal point in the wrong place. </li>\n  <li> Gaps in understanding&mdash;for example, misunderstanding of the problem or the rules of algebra, applying an ineffective strategy, or choosing the wrong operation or step. </li>\n  <li> Lack of precision or incomplete communication&mdash;for example, missing steps or explanations, incorrect notation, or forgetting labels or parentheses. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>9.3.3: Self Check&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>\n        <p>Examine the work shown.
