The point \\((1.5,0)\\) is located in the region where the two shaded regions overlap, which means it is a solution to both inequalities in the system.</li></ol><p></p>\n<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>\n<h5>More Chances</h5>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p>"
