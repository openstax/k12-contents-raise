In this partner activity, students are presented with pairs of values that represent quantities and take turns describing the relationship between the quantities&mdash;first using words, and then using equations.</p>\n  <p>To do so, they need to interpret the values in context, look for structure or patterns, and generalize them. As they do so, students also practice reasoning quantitatively and abstractly. As students trade roles explaining their thinking and listening, they have opportunities to explain their reasoning and critique the reasoning of others.</p>\n  <p>As students discuss their thinking, listen for the different ways they describe the same relationship. For example, here are some ways students might describe the relationship in the second table (&ldquo;meters from home&rdquo; and &ldquo;meters from school&rdquo;):</p>\n  <p></p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>The distance from home and the distance from school always add up to 400.</li>\n    <li>The distance from school is always 400 minus the distance from home.</li>\n    <li>As the distance from home, \\(x \\), increases by a number, the distance from school, \\(y \\), decreases by the same number. \\(x \\) starts at 0, and \\(y \\) starts at 400.</li>\n    <li>The distance between home and school is 400 meters. The table seems to be telling us about a person traveling from home to school and how their distance to home and distance to school change along the way.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p></p>\n  <p>Select students with different analyses and descriptions to share later.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Launch</h3>\n<div>\n  <p>Print the blackline document &ldquo;Whose Data Is This?&rdquo;</p>\n  <p>Have students cut out the variable cards and the data boxes. In pairs, have students work together to create viable arguments for matching the variables with the data. This discussion naturally provides the opportunity to discuss how the quantities are related.</p>\n  <p><a href=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/6a4899b588221714917e1a70a5ce691169fb7107\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Whose Data Is This?&rdquo;</a></p>\n  <p>This will lead the discussion for problem number 1.</p>\n  <p>Consider asking partners to also take turns matching the tables to the equations in the second question.</p>\n  <p>Some students may not know what is meant by &ldquo;amount deposited&rdquo; in Table D.

Really understanding what&rsquo;s happening in the situation, however, often requires carefully interpreting the operations that relate the two quantities.</p>\n      </div>\n      <h2>1.3.2: Self Check</h2>\n      <div>\n        <p><strong><em>Following the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n        <table>\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td colspan=\"2\">\n                <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>QUESTION:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n                <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" height=\"88\">\n                  <tbody>\n                    <tr>\n                      <td valign=\"top\">\n                        <p><strong>Miles from Home, \\( x \\)</strong></p>\n                      </td>\n                      <td valign=\"top\">\n                        <p><strong>0</strong></p>\n                      </td>\n                      <td valign=\"top\">\n                        <p><strong>5</strong></p>\n                      </td>\n                      <td valign=\"top\">\n                        <p><strong>10</strong></p>\n                      </td>\n                    </tr>\n                    <tr>\n                      <td valign=\"top\">\n                        <p><strong>Miles from School, \\( y \\)</strong></p>\n                      </td>\n                      <td valign=\"top\">\n                        <p><strong>30</strong></p>\n                      </td>\n                      <td valign=\"top\">\n                        <p><strong>25</strong></p>\n                      </td>\n                      <td valign=\"top\">\n                        <p><strong>20</strong></p>\n                      </td>\n                    </tr>\n                  </tbody>\n                </table>\n                <p><br>Using the table above, what is an equation that shows the relationship between miles from home and miles from school?</p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n          </tbody>\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td><strong>ANSWERS</strong></td>\n              <td><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>\\( y=30+x \\)</td>\n              <td>Incorrect.
