The school has at most 30 gallons of paint. The painter needs \\(\\frac52\\) gallons of paint for each classroom. How many classrooms can the school paint at most?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We know that the answer is greater than or equal to 0 classrooms, so \\(x\\geq0\\).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We also know that each classroom requires \\(\\frac52\\) or 2.5 gallons of paint.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let&rsquo;s take a guess at how many classrooms and check if we are close to the solution. How many gallons of paint would we need to paint 10 classrooms?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\\(10 &times; 2.5 = 25\\), and since \\(25 &lt; 30\\), it could be possible for the school to paint 10 classrooms.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We can try 11 classrooms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\\(11 &times; 2.5 = 27.5\\), and since \\(27.5 &lt; 30\\), it could be possible for the school to paint 11 classrooms.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We can try 12 classrooms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\\(12 &times; 2.5 = 30\\), and since \\(30 = 30\\), the most classrooms the school could paint is 12 classrooms.</p>\n<h4>Try It: Using Inequalities to Solve a Problem</h4>\n<!--Text Entry Interaction Start -->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"eventShow\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-content\">\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While working in a car factory, a worker can use a drill for as long as the batteries last.
