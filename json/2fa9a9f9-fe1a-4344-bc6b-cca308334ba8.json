Explain why <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 2(x-2) = 50 \\)</span> is also true for the same value of <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( x \\)</span>.\n          </li>\n<li>To solve the equation <span class=\"math\">\\( 7.5d=2.5d \\)</span>, Lin divides each side by <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 2.5d \\)</span>, and Elena subtracts <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 2.5d \\)</span> from each side.\n            <ol>\n<li>Will both moves lead to the solution? Explain your reasoning.\n              </li>\n<li>What is the solution?</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<h3>Student Response</h3>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<ol>\n<li>If <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 4(x-2) \\)</span> and 100 are equal, then multiplying <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 4(x-2) \\)</span> by <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( \\frac12 \\)</span> and multiplying 100 by <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( \\frac12 \\)</span> will give two results that are also equal, so <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 2(x-2)=50 \\)</span> must be true.</li>\n<li>\n<ol>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>No. For example: Lin&rsquo;s move won&rsquo;t work. Dividing by <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 2.5d \\)</span> gives <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 3=1 \\)</span>, which is not true. Dividing by the variable we are trying to solve for makes us think there is no solution.</li>\n<li><span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( d=0 \\)</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"response-to-student-thinking\">\n<h3>Response to Student Thinking</h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<h4>Points to Emphasize</h4>Address student misconceptions about dividing by a variable at the beginning of the next lesson. If students struggle with division in the first part of the cool-down, look for moments to emphasize the procedure of doing the same thing to both sides in Lessons 1.8 and 1.9.\n      </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"student-summary\">\n<div class=\"body\">\n<div class=\"imgrid\">\n<div class=\"g--row g--row-1\">\n<div class=\"g--col-2 g--column g--content g--half g--row-1\">\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"
