In this section, you will write quadratic expressions in both forms and use both forms to identify key characteristics of quadratic graphs such as \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-intercepts.</p>\n<p>This section includes three lessons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Equivalent Quadratic Expressions </li>\n<li> Standard Form and Factored Form </li>\n<li> Graphs of Functions in Standard and Factored Forms </li>\n</ul>"
