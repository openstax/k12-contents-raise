The plan from Company D costs $80 per month, with unlimited data.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Rule \\(C\\) gives the monthly cost, in dollars, of using \\(g\\) gigabytes of data on Company C&rsquo;s plan. Rule \\(D\\) gives the monthly cost, in dollars, of using \\(g\\) gigabytes of data on Company D&rsquo;s plan. </p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"1\" type=\"a\">\n  <li>Which sentence describes the meaning of the statement \\(C(2)=40\\)?</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n  <li>It costs $40 to use 2 gigabytes of data using plan C. </li>\n  <li>It costs $40 to use 2 gigabytes of data using plan D.</li>\n  <li>It costs $2 to use 40 gigabytes of data using plan C.</li>\n  <li>It costs $2 to use 40 gigabytes of data using plan D.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;It costs $40 to use 2 gigabytes of data using plan C. </p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\" type=\"a\">\n  <li>Which is less, \\(C(4)\\) or \\(D(4)\\)? </li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>\\(C(4)\\) is less. \\(C(4)=70\\) and \\(D(4)=80\\).&nbsp;The phone plan from Company C is less expensive if 4 gigabytes of data are used.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\" type=\"a\">\n  <li>Which is less, \\(C(5)\\) or \\(D(5)\\)?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>\\(D(5)\\) is less. \\(D(5)=80\\) and \\(C(5) =85\\).
