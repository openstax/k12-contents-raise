This means choosing an independent and dependent variable and expressing the relationships using function language and, in some cases, function notation. You use variables to represent one real-world quantity as a function of another, which is an example of decontextualizing and reasoning abstractly.</p>\n<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Use function notation to write equations that represent exponential relationships. </li>\n  <li> Determine whether the relationships in descriptions, tables, equations, or graphs are functions. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 5.8.1: Meaning of a Function Presented Graphically </li>\n  <li> 5.8.2: Represent a Function as a Table of Values, Graph, and Equation\n    <ul>\n      <li> 5.8.2: Self Check </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li> 5.8.3: Using Function Language and Notation\n    <ul>\n      <li> 5.8.3: Self Check </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li> 5.8.4: Function Notation </li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 5.8.5: Practice </li>\n</ul>\n<br>"
