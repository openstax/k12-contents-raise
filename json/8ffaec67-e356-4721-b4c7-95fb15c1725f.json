A sorting and matching task gives students opportunities to analyze representations, statements, and structures closely and to make connections (MP2, MP7).</p>\n  <p>As students explain their thinking to a partner, encourage them to use precise language and mathematical terms to refine their explanations (MP6).</p>\n  <p>Here are images of the sorted cards for reference and planning.</p>\n  <p><br></p>\n  <p><strong><span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Group 1 - situation: perimeter of a\n          rectangle&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Group 2 - situation: jar of coins</span></span></strong></p><br>\n  <div>\n    <div>\n      <div>\n        <div><img alt=\"Card sort.\" class=\"img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom\" height=\"653\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/6e18755e8fa43df186065a7fa74bc9524119aa02\" width=\"550\"></div>\n        <div><strong></strong></div>\n        <div><strong><span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Group 3 - situation: honey and jam&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Group 4 - situation: a school trip</span></span></strong><br></div>\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <div><img alt=\"Card sort.\" class=\"img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom\" height=\"653\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/90b501ef958b304beea21f5127a96a3f6fe44dd5\" width=\"550\"></div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h3>Launch</h3>\n<div>\n  <p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Distribute one set of pre-cut slips or cards to each group.</p>\n  <p>Ask students to take turns matching a group of 4 cards with representations of the same situation and explaining how they know the representations belong together. Emphasize that while one partner explains, the other should listen carefully, and the group should discuss any disagreements.</p>\n  <h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>\n  <div>\n    <p><em></em>Use this routine to prepare students for the whole-class discussion. At the appropriate time, invite groups to create a visual display for one of the situations. In addition to the 4 cards, students should consider what types of details (annotations, notes, arrows, etc.) to include on their displays that will help communicate the reasoning behind their choices. Begin the whole-class discussion by selecting and arranging 2-4 displays for all to see. Give students 2-3 minutes of quiet time to think individually to interpret the displays before inviting the authors to present their work.<br></p>\n  </div>\n  <div><em><br></em></div>\n  <h4>Support for Students with Disabilities</h4>\n  <div>\n    <p><em></em><i>E</i><em>ngagement: Develop Effort and Persistence.</em>&nbsp;Provide a checklist that focuses on increasing the length of on-task orientation in the face of distractions. For example, use the directions to create a bulleted checklist of the steps. Invite students to check off the steps at the completion of each phase of the activity. An example list may include items such as: taking turns with matching, 2 explanations for each partner, 2 responses/rebuttals for each partner, and 4 agreed upon final responses as a team.<br><em>Supports accessibility for: Attention; Social-emotional skills</em><em></em></p>\n  </div>\n  <div><em><br></em></div>\n</div>\n<h3>Student Facing Statement</h3>\n<div>\n  <p>Your teacher will give you a set of cards. Take turns with your partner to match a group of 4 cards that contain: a situation, an inequality that represents it, a graph that represents the solution region, and a solution written as a coordinate pair.</p>\n  <p>For each match that you find, explain to your partner how you know it's a match.</p>\n  <p>For each match that your partner finds, listen carefully to their explanation. If you disagree, discuss your thinking and work to reach an agreement.</p>\n  <p>Record your matches.</p>\n  <div>\n    <div>\n      <div>\n        <p><strong>Group 1</strong></p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><span>situation: perimeter of a rectangle</span></li>\n          <li><span>inequality:</span></li>\n          <li><span>a solution:</span></li>\n          <li><span>sketch of graph:</span></li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <p><strong>Group 2</strong></p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>situation: jar of coins</li>\n          <li>inequality:</li>\n          <li>a solution:</li>\n          <li>sketch of graph:</li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n      <div>\n        <p><strong>Group 3</strong></p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>situation: honey and jam</li>\n          <li>inequality:</li>\n          <li>a solution:</li>\n          <li>sketch of graph:</li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <p><strong>Group 4</strong></p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>situation: a school trip</li>\n          <li>inequality:</li>\n          <li>a solution:</li>\n          <li>sketch of graph:</li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h3>Student Response</h3>\n<div>\n  <p>See images of sorted cards in the Activity Narrative.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>\n<div>\n  <p>Select groups of students to share their results and explain their rationales.

Each small photo she displays costs her $4 and each large photo costs her $10. She doesn&rsquo;t want to spend more than $200 on photos to display.</p>\n<p>Let&nbsp;\\( x \\) be the number of small photos and&nbsp;\\( y \\) be the number of large photos that Christy displays.</p>\n<p>We know that each small photo costs $4 to display and each large photo costs $10. We also know that she doesn&rsquo;t want to spend more than $200.</p>\n<p>The inequality that represents this situation is \\( 4x + 10y &le; 200 \\).</p>\n<p>To be able to connect this inequality with possible solutions, translating it into a graph is an important step.</p>\n<h4><span lang=\"EN\">Try\n    It: Connecting Representations of Inequalities</span></h4>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Graph\n    the linear inequality:&nbsp;\\( 4x + 10y &le; 200 \\).</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Is it possible for\n    Christy to display 15 small paintings and 15 large paintings and maintain her\n    budget of $200?</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Write down your answer.\n    Then select the <strong>Solution </strong>button to\n    compare your work.</span></p>\n<h4>Solution</h4>\n<img alt class=\"img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom\" height=\"296\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c011d02915efb5899c174dca5d1dd4f1b5cf58af\" width=\"300\"><br>\n<p><br>No; the ordered pair (15, 15) does not fall within the region representing the solution. Another way to verify this is by using the inequality.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\\( \\begin{eqnarray} 4x + 10y &le; 200 \\\\ 4(15) + 10(15) \\leq 200 \\\\60 + 150 \\leq 200\\\\210 \\nleq 200 \\end{eqnarray} \\)<br></p>\n<p>Since $210 is not less than $200, 15 small paintings and 15 large paintings does not stay with Christy&rsquo;s budget of $200.</p><br>\n<p>How did you do? Know that you learn more from wrong answers than from right answers! Wrong answers help us find flaws in our thinking. Take a minute to think about <em>why</em> you got the question wrong. Then you won&rsquo;t get this type of question wrong again!</p>"
