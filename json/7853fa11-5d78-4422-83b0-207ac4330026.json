In this activity, students are introduced to the range of a function and examine it in terms of a situation. They begin to consider how the domain and range of a function are related to the features of its graph.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Keep students in groups of 2&ndash;4. Give students a few minutes of quiet work time, and then a moment to share their responses with their group. Leave a few minutes for whole-class discussion.</p>\n<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n<div>\n<p>Leverage choice around perceived challenge. Invite students to analyze either the area function or the revenue function.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement </h4>\n<p>In an earlier activity, you saw a function representing the area of a square (function \\(A\\)) and another representing the revenue of a tennis camp (function \\(R\\)). Refer to the descriptions of those functions to answer these questions.</p>\n<ol>\n<li> Here is a graph that represents function \\(A\\), defined by \\(A(s)=s^2\\), where \\(s\\) is the side length of the square in centimeters. <br>\n<br>\n<img alt=\"A graph.&nbsp;\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/76576c471fa89bdb2f5e278ace7605136df739d5\">\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li> Name three possible input-output pairs of this function. </li>\n<li> Earlier, we described the set of all possible input values of \\(A\\) as &ldquo;any number greater than or equal to 0.&rdquo; How would you describe the set of all possible output values of \\(A\\)? </li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li> Function \\(R\\) is defined by \\(R(n)=40n\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of campers.\n    <ol type=\"a\">\n<li> Is 20 a possible output value in this situation? What about 100? Explain your reasoning. </li>\n<li> Here are two graphs that relate number of students and camp revenue in dollars. Which graph could represent function \\(R\\)? Explain why the other one could not represent the function.<br>\n<br>\n<img alt=\"A graph.&nbsp;\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4ef73b4c27d99682a72671f9517d57581e0d3589\"> <br>\n<br>\n<img alt=\"A graph.&nbsp;\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/8e212f8010016b9ef2ed559709268813ad1477b2\">\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<ol start=\"3\" type=\"a\">\n<li> Describe the set of all possible output values of \\(R\\). </li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<h4> Student Response</h4>\n<ol>\n<li> For example: </li>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>\\(A(2)=4\\), \\(A(3)=9\\), and \\(A(7)=49\\), or \\((2,4)\\), \\((3,9)\\), \\((7,49)\\)</li>\n<li> The outputs of \\(A\\) are also all numbers greater than or equal to 0. </li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li> For example: </li>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li> No, both 20 and 100 cannot be outputs because the input (the number of campers) cannot be fractions. </li>\n<li> The second graph could represent function \\(R\\). The first graph could not represent the function \\(R\\) because it includes all points for \\(n\\)-values between 0 and 5, \\(n\\)-values greater than 16, and fractional \\(n\\)-values. All of these \\(n\\)-values don&rsquo;t apply in this situation. </li>\n<li> The outputs of \\(R\\) are all multiples of 40 between 200 and 640 (200, 240, 280, and so on). </li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<p>Write the following definition:&nbsp;<span>The set of output values form the range of the function.</span></p>\n<h4>Video: Identifying Outputs of a Function</h4>\n<p>Watch the following video to learn more about identifying outputs of a function.</p>\n<video controls=\"true\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" width=\"550\">\n<source src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/21adf0146df228d483924077672ad2140a3bb95d\">\n<track default=\"true\" kind=\"captions\" label=\"On\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/e0decf3ffc5d4cbc1b14b2110a48743a7ffa6739\" srclang=\"en_us\">\n  https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/21adf0146df228d483924077672ad2140a3bb95d\n</video>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h4>Student-Facing Extension</h4>\n<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>\n<p>If the camp wishes to collect at least $500 from the participants, how many students can they have? Explain how this information is shown on the graph.</p>\n<h4>Extension Student Response</h4>\n<p>They will need at least 13 students to collect $500 or more, so the possibilities are 13, 14, 15, and 16. On the graph, there are only 4 dots that lie on or above the horizontal line representing $500.</p>\n<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>\n<p>Some students may mistakenly associate the domain and range of a function with the horizontal and vertical values that are visible in a graphing window, or with the upper and lower limits of the scale of each axis on a coordinate plane. For example, they may think that the range of the area function, \\(A\\), includes only values from 0 to 50 because the scale on the vertical axis goes from 0 to 50. Ask these students if it is possible to use a different scale on each axis or, if the function is graphed using technology, to adjust the graphing window. Clarify that the domain and range should be considered in terms of a situation rather than the graphing boundaries.</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Invite students to share their descriptions of the possible outputs for each function. Explain that we call the set of all possible output values of a function the range of the function. Emphasize that the range of a function depends on its domain (or all possible input values).</p>\n<ul>\n<li> For the area of the square, the range&mdash;all the possible values of \\(A(s)\\)&mdash;includes all numbers that are at least 0. </li>\n<li> For the revenue of the tennis camp, the range&mdash;all the possible values of \\(R(n)\\)&mdash;includes positive multiples of 40 that are at least 200 and at most 640. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next, focus the discussion on function \\(R\\).</p>\n<p>Ask students to explain which values could or could not be the outputs of \\(R\\) and which of the two graphs represents the function. Clarify that although the graph showing only points more accurately reflects the domain and range of the function, plotting those points could be pretty tedious. We could use a line graph to represent the function, as long as we specify or are clear that only whole numbers are in the domain and only multiples of 20 are in the range.</p>\n<p>If time permits, draw students&rsquo; attention to the temperature function they saw in an earlier activity, defined by \\(k(c)=c+273.15\\). It gives the temperature in Kelvin as a function of the temperature in Celsius, \\(c\\). Ask students:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&ldquo;What values are in the domain of this function?&rdquo; (The domain includes any value that is at least &ndash;273.15, the lowest possible temperature in Celsius, or greater.) </li>\n<li>&ldquo;What about the range?&rdquo; (The range includes any value that is at least 0, the lowest possible temperature in Kelvin, or greater.) </li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>\n<div>\n<p>Before students share their descriptions of the possible output values of \\(A\\), present an incorrect response and explanation. For example, &ldquo;The outputs of \\(A\\) are numbers from 0 to 50 because I looked on the vertical axis and saw that the graph reaches up to 50.&rdquo; Ask students to identify the error, critique the reasoning, and write a correct explanation. As students discuss with a partner, monitor for students who clarify that the output values are not restricted by the graphing boundaries shown. This helps students evaluate, and improve upon, the written mathematical arguments of others as they discuss the range of a function.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>4.11.3: Self Check&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<colgroup>\n<col>\n<col>\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p><strong>QUESTION:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Looking at the graph below, which statement about the values graphed is true?</p>\n<p><img alt=\"SCATTER PLOT WITH POINTS AT (2, 7), (3, 9), (4, 11), (5, 13), (6, 15), (7, 17), AND (8, 19).\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/94a38b96d0df6fd05f92cff8642a934fc7ffc7b2\" width=\"300\"></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>The largest output value is 8.</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Incorrect.
