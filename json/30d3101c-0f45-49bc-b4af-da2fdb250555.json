You found the equation of the parabola that modeled the path a peanut needed to take to jump over the wall in a simulation. </li>\n    <li> 7.17.3: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 7.17.3: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 7.17.4: Transforming the Parent Function </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> In this optional activity, you were given pieces of parabolas and worked to find the equation of each piece and justify your reasoning. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 7.17.5: Equations of Graph Translations </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> In this activity, you looked at both graphs and equations and declared the translations that were made from the parent function \\(f(x)=x^2\\) to the new equation. </li>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following<strong> practice:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 7.17.6: Practice </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-content-id=\"76341840-7956-4cb5-a7bb-7fad8c7d4da1\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <!--pulldown-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-content-id=\"8cabfc1f-a1fb-4e2c-b3c3-bb3d61c6ea69\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n      <p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n      <p>Correct!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n      <p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!--Do not edit below line.-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n</div>"
