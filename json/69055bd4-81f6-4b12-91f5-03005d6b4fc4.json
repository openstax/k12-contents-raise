Along the way, she ran into some trouble.</p>\n<ol>\n  <li> Find \\(f(x)\\) for each \\(x\\)-value Clare listed. Describe what Clare&rsquo;s trouble might be. </li>\n</ol>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"43\">\n    <col width=\"44\">\n    <col width=\"36\">\n    <col width=\"30\">\n    <col width=\"35\">\n    <col width=\"27\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>&ndash;10</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>0</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(\\frac12\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>2</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>8</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(f(x)\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td><br></td>\n      <td><br></td>\n      <td><br></td>\n      <td><br></td>\n      <td><br></td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n  <li> Use graphing technology to graph function \\(f\\).

See graph. <br>\n    <img src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/96004ae78a7d26533c5df1c35813907286cbdc59\"><br>\n  </li>\n  <li> When I tried to find \\(f(2)\\) with a calculator, it gave an error message. </li>\n  <li> For example: The domain includes all numbers except 2. </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Student-Facing Extension</h4>\n<h5>Are You Ready for More?</h5>\n<p>Why do you think the graph of function \\(f\\) looks the way it does? Why are there two parts that split at \\(x=2\\), with one curving down as it approaches \\(x=2\\) from the left and the other curving up as it approaches \\(x=2\\) from the right?</p>\n<p>Evaluate function \\(f\\) at different \\(x\\)-values that approach 2 but are not exactly 2, such as 1.8, 1.9, 1.95, 1.999, 2.2, 2.1, 2.05, 2.001, and so on. What do you notice about the values of \\(f(x)\\) as the \\(x\\)-values get closer and closer to 2?</p>\n<h4>Extension Student Response</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li> When \\(x\\) is less than 2, as it gets closer to 2 (from the left side), the denominator in \\(\\frac{6}{x-2}\\) becomes a smaller and smaller negative value, so the quotient, \\(f(x)\\), gets larger and larger in the negative direction. It does so very quickly, which explains why the curve bends down rather dramatically. </li>\n  <li> When \\(x\\) is greater than 2, as it approaches 2 (from the right side), the denominator in \\(\\frac{6}{x-2}\\) becomes a smaller and smaller positive value, so \\(f(x)\\) gets larger and larger in the positive direction. It does so very quickly as well, which explains the graph shooting up if we trace it from right to left. </li>\n  <li> The expression \\(\\frac{6}{x-2}\\) is undefined at \\(x=2\\), and we can see that the two pieces of the graph shoot off in opposite directions as \\(x\\) approaches 2 from the left and from the right, which explains the gap at \\(x=2\\). </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Display a graph of the function for all to see. Invite students to share their observations of the behavior of function \\(f\\) based on the completed table and their graph. Solicit their ideas on what the problem might be with this function.</p>\n<p>If no students mentioned division by 0 as the issue, bring this up. Ask questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>&ldquo;What happens when we divide a number by 0?&rdquo; (The result is undefined.) </li>\n  <li>&ldquo;In the expression \\(\\frac{6}{x-2}\\), what value or values of \\(x\\) would result in a denominator of 0?&rdquo; (Only 2 gives a denominator of 0.) </li>\n  <li>&ldquo;If 2 does not produce an output, is it a possible input for \\(f\\)?&rdquo; (No) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Highlight that the domain of \\(f\\) includes all numbers except 2.</p>"
