Now he is using that interest as a PhD candidate at MIT to produce longer-lasting batteries, which can cut down the impact on the environment. He can use functions to help him analyze energy inputs and outputs as he studies battery power and efficiency.</p>\n<p>In this section, you will take a closer look at the input and output of a function. You will learn to identify the domain, inputs, and range, outputs, of a function based on context and graphs.</p>\n<p>This section includes 2 lessons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n    4.11 Domain and Range, Part 1</li>\n<li>\n    4.12 Domain and Range, Part 2</li>\n</ul>"
