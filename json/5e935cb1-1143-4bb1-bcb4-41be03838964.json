You also worked to find the slope and \\(y\\)-intercept from a graph to then write the equation of the line in slope-intercept form.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>1.12.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>1.12.3: Writing an Equation Given the Slope and a Point&nbsp;<ul>\n      <li>In this activity, you used point-slope form to write the equation of a line given a slope and a point. You then wrote the equation in slope-intercept form.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>1.12.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>1.12.4: Write an Equation Given Two Points<ul>\n      <li>In this activity, you found the slope between two points and confirmed it with the slope formula. You then used one point and the slope to write the equation of a line in point-slope form. From here, you wrote the equation in slope-intercept form and used the graph to check your equation.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>1.12.4: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>1.12.5: Choosing a Method to Write an Equation<ul>\n      <li>In this activity, you discussed when to use each method of writing an equation. With a partner, you worked to find slopes and equations of lines using different methods.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</span><br></p>\n<div class=\"editor-indent\">\n  <p>1.12.5: Practice</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-content-id=\"831b6905-7fa6-43ae-a970-6d9502f45b4e\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <!--Q1-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-content-id=\"f8e363d0-f470-48d5-9350-f76284622244\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n      <p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n      <p>Correct!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n      <p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!----------------- Must be included at the bottom of page for dropdown to work ------------>\n  <!--Do not edit below line.-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n</div>"
