All of the functions share the same context. Students then use these features to reason about the likely domain and range of each function.</p>\n<p>To make the matches, students analyze and interpret features of the graphs, looking for and making use of structure in the situation and in the graph. Here are some possible ways students may reason about each match:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> The swing goes up and down while the child is swinging, so D could be a graph for function \\(h\\). </li>\n  <li> The time left on the swing decreases as the time on the swing increases, so A is a possible graph for function \\(r\\). </li>\n  <li> The distance of the child from the top beam of the swing doesn&rsquo;t change as long as the child is on the swing, so C is a possible graph for function \\(d\\). </li>\n  <li> The total number of times the swing is pushed must be a counting number and cannot be fractional. Graph B has multiple pieces, and each one could represent the total number of pushes for certain intervals of time, so B is a possible graph of function \\(s\\). </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students reason quantitatively and abstractly as they connect verbal and graphical representations of functions and as they think about the domain and range of each function.</p>\n<h4> Launch</h4>\n<p>Ask students to imagine a child getting on a swing, swinging for 30 seconds, and then getting off the swing. Explain that they will look at four functions that can be found in this situation. Their job is to match verbal descriptions and graphs that define the same functions, and then to think about reasonable domain and range for each function. Tell students they will need additional information for the last question.</p>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Give students a few minutes of quiet time to think about the first two questions and then time to discuss their thinking with their partner. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>\n<p>Invite students to share their matching decisions and explanations as to how they know each pair of representations belongs together. Make sure that students can offer an explanation for each match, including for their last pair (other than because the description and the graph are the only pair left). See some possible explanations in the Activity Narrative.</p>\n<p>Next, ask students to share the points that they think would be helpful for determining the domain and range of each function. (Students are to mark these on their handout of graphs.) If students gesture to the intercepts, a maximum, or a minimum on a graph but do not use those terms to refer to points, ask them to use mathematical terms to clarify what they mean.</p>\n<p>Here is the information students will need for question 3. Display it for all to see, or provide it as requested. If the requested information is not shown or cannot be reasoned from what is available, ask students to request a different piece of information.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> The child is given 30 seconds on the swing. </li>\n  <li> While the child is on the swing, an adult pushes the swing a total of 5 times. </li>\n  <li> The swing is 1.5 feet (18 inches) above ground. </li>\n  <li> The chains that hold the seat and suspend it from the top beam are 7 feet long. </li>\n  <li> The highest point that the child swings up to is 4 feet above the ground. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>If time is limited, ask each partner to choose two functions (different from their partner&rsquo;s) and write the domain and range for only those functions.</p>\n<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>\n<div>\n  <p> Use this routine to support whole-class discussion as students explain how they matched the function description to the graph. Display the following sentence frames for all to see: &ldquo;_____ matches the graph _____ because . . .&rdquo; and &ldquo;I noticed _____, so . . . .&rdquo; Encourage students to challenge each other when they disagree. The sentence frames will help students consider the domain and range of functions as they connect written descriptions with graphical representations.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n<div>\n  <p>Use color coding and annotations to highlight connections between representations in a problem. For example, invite students to highlight the input in each description using one color, label the horizontal axis of each graph, and highlight the label in the same color. Then they can repeat the process for the outputs and the vertical axes.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h4> Student-Facing Statement </h4>\n<p>A child gets on a swing in a playground, swings for 30 seconds, and then gets off the swing.</p>\n<ol>\n  <li> Here are descriptions of four functions in the situation and four graphs representing them.\n    The independent variable in each function is time, measured in seconds. </li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"A girl on a swing.&nbsp;\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/bc837af9aa5dab30f8a5f535195cc04f8c38e69d\" width=\"300\"></p>\n<p>Match each function with a graph that could represent it. Then, label the axes with the appropriate variables. Be prepared to explain how you make your matches.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Function \\(h\\): The height of the swing, in feet, as a function of time since the child gets on the swing </li>\n  <li> Function \\(r\\): The amount of time left on the swing as a function of time since the child gets on the swing </li>\n  <li> Function \\(d\\): The distance, in feet, of the swing from the top beam (from which the swing is suspended) as a function of time since the child gets on the swing </li>\n  <li> Function \\(s\\): The total number of times an adult pushes the swing as a function of time since the child gets on the swing </li>\n</ul>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n  <li><br>\n    <img alt=\"A graph with origin O.

Be prepared to explain why you chose those points. </li>\n  <li> Once you receive the information you need from your teacher, describe the domain and range that would be reasonable for each function in this situation. </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<ol>\n  <li> </li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n  <li> Function \\(h\\): Graph D; horizontal axis: time (seconds); vertical axis: height (feet) </li>\n  <li> Function \\(r\\): Graph A; horizontal axis: time (seconds); vertical axis: time (seconds) </li>\n  <li> Function \\(d\\): Graph C; horizontal axis: time (seconds); vertical axis: distance (feet) </li>\n  <li> Function \\(s\\): Graph B; horizontal axis: time (seconds); vertical axis: number of pushes </li>\n</ul>\n<li> Answers vary, but students are likely to choose the vertical and horizontal intercepts and the maximum and minimum points. </li>\n<li> Sample response: The domain for all functions is time in seconds, so they include all numbers from 0 to 30. </li>\n<ul>\n  <li> Function \\(h\\): The range includes all numbers from 1.5 to 4. </li>\n  <li> Function \\(r\\): The range includes all numbers from 0 to 30. </li>\n  <li> Function \\(d\\): The range includes only one value, 7. </li>\n  <li> Function \\(s\\): The range includes only whole numbers from 0 to 5. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>\n<p>Some students may struggle to match the descriptions and the graphs because they confuse the independent and dependent variables and think that, in each situation, time is represented by the vertical axis. Encourage them to reread the activity statement, clarify the input and output in each situation, label the horizontal graph with the input, and then try interpreting the graphs again.</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Select students to share the domain and range for each function and their reasoning. Record and display their responses for all to see.</p>\n<p>One key point to highlight is that the range of a function could be a single value (say 7, as shown in graph C), a bunch of isolated values (say, only some whole numbers, as shown in graph B), all values in an interval (say, all values from 1.5 to 4, as shown in graph D, or all values between 0 and 30, as in graph A), or a combination of these.</p>\n<p>The domain of a function may also be limited in similar ways. Tell students that, in upcoming lessons, we will look at functions in which the rules relating their input and output are a bit more complex, so their domain and range are also a bit more complex.</p>\n<h3>4.12.2: Self Check&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity</em></strong>.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n        <p>Which of the following is true about the range of the graph below?</p>\n        <p><img alt=\"A graph.&nbsp;\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/45e09a83bdc5c7224223b36cc5540575fafd4bb2\"></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>The range of this function includes all values that are at least 0 and no more than 70.</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incorrect.
