You can use what you know about slope and \\(y\\)-intercept to connect the graphs to real situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<ol type=\"A\">\n<li>&nbsp;<img alt=\"A graph.&nbsp;\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c7fc88dc3b0da7a46a0c644e0c4786add867d9ee\"><br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li> <img alt=\"horizontal axis, time in seconds. vertical axis, distance from home in meters.\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/2279bed699a939618c7f75f3d6489b4b46794c20\"><br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li> <img alt=\"horizontal axis, time in seconds. vertical axis, distance from home in meters.\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/fbabad0019c2bf972ae40909c395177003506908\"></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Match each description with one of the graphs above:</p>\n<p>1. Elena begins at home and runs away from her home at a constant rate.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Elena starts at home, so the graph must start at the origin. She moves away from home at a constant speed, so the graph must be a line that increases to the right. <strong>Graph B</strong> matches the description.</p>\n<p>2. Clare begins her walk at school and walks home at a constant rate.</p>\n<p>Clare starts at school, so the \\(y\\)-intercept is a point on the \\(y\\)-axis that shows the distance her home is from the school. She moves closer to home at a constant speed, so the graph must be a line that decreases to the right. <strong>Graph C</strong> matches the description.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. Lin begins at home and runs away from home, and then walks for a while.</p>\n<p>Lin starts at home, so the graph must start at the origin. She starts running and then walks, so the graph is a line with a slope that starts off steep and then continues with a less steep slope. <strong>Graph A</strong> matches the description.</p>\n<h4>Try It: Match a Description with a Graph</h4>\n<p><img alt=\"Graph on coordinate plane.&nbsp;\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/55b02a86438461d22b79be95364ebdcfc81d4ae5\"></p>\n<p>Describe the graph.

The line is increasing, so the walker is moving at a constant speed away from home. Then the line decreases at a constant rate, so the walker is moving at a constant rate toward home.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here is a possible description:</p>\n<p>Lin begins at home and walks away from home for a while, and then she walks back home.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h4>Check Your Understanding</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Check\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<!--Q#-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"multiplechoice\" data-solution=\"Max begins his walk at the library, walks home at a constant rate, and then walks away from home at a constant rate.\" data-solution-options='[\"Max begins his walk at the library and walks away from home at a constant rate.\", \"Max begins his walk at the library and walks home at a constant rate.\", \"Max begins his walk at the library, walks home at a constant rate, and then walks away from home at a constant rate.\", \"Max begins at home and walks away from home for a while, then walks back home.\"]'>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n<p>Which statement best describes the situation shown in the graph?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Graph of a line, origin O.\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/3b7cd6d6d203962621bf60bf39a2800b97ef62b7\"><br></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<p>Correct!
