You can use what you know about slope and \\(y\\)-intercept to connect the graphs to real situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<ol type=\"A\">\n<li>&nbsp;<img alt=\"A graph.&nbsp;\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/im-ims-export/ZnAkBiZLLHevAL32XWdBfGuW\"><br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li> <img alt=\"horizontal axis, time in seconds. vertical axis, distance from home in meters.\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/im-ims-export/CLvGC3dCyx77XUWQjcRoDfqX\"><br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li> <img alt=\"horizontal axis, time in seconds. vertical axis, distance from home in meters.\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/im-ims-export/4XRdh3es5MhtQEPQ8Kk6bCtQ\"></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Match each description with one of the graphs above:</p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<p role=\"presentation\">Elena begins at home and runs away from her home at a constant rate.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Elena starts at home, so the graph must start at the origin. She moves away from home at a constant speed, so the graph must be a line that increases to the right. Graph B matches the description.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<p role=\"presentation\">Clare begins her walk at school and walks home at a constant rate.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Clare starts at school, so the \\(y\\)-intercept is a point on the \\(y\\)-axis that shows the distance her home is from the school. She moves closer to home at a constant speed, so the graph must be a line that decreases to the right. Graph C matches the description.&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<p role=\"presentation\">Lin begins at home and runs away from home, and then walks for a while.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Lin starts at home, so the graph must start at the origin. She starts running and then walks, so the graph is a line with a slope that starts off steep and then continues with a less steep slope. Graph A matches the description.</p>\n<h4>Try It: Match a Description with a Graph</h4>\n<p><img alt=\"Graph on coordinate plane.&nbsp;\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/im-ims-export/YvgNbN5s3VyHWRTFyQwPQrC3\"></p>\n<p>Describe the graph.
