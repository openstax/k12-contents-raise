(For example, \\(6^2\\) and \\((-6)^2\\) both equal 36, so 6 and -6 are both square roots of 36.) </li>\n<li> The square root symbol \\((\\sqrt{\\;\\;})\\) can be used to express the positive square root of a number. For example, the square root of 36 is 6, but it can also be written as \\(\\sqrt{36}\\) because \\(\\sqrt{36} \\cdot \\sqrt{36}=36\\). </li>\n<li> To express the negative square root of a number, say 36, we can write -6 or \\(- \\sqrt{36}\\). </li>\n<li> When a number is not a perfect square (for example, 40), we can express its square roots by writing \\(\\sqrt{40}\\) and \\(- \\sqrt{40}\\). </li>\n</ul>"
