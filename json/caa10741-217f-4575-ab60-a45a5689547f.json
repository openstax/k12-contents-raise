It gives the teacher an opportunity to hear how students use terminology and talk about characteristics of the items in comparison to one another.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this activity is to remind students that repeated addition can be represented with multiplication and repeated multiplication can be represented with an exponent, which will help them make sense of some of the different ways equations for sequences can be written.</p>\n<h4> Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 2&ndash;4. Display the expressions for all to see. Give students 1 minute of quiet think time and then time to share their thinking with their small group. In their small groups, ask each student to share their reasoning why a particular item does not belong.</p>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>\n<p>Which one doesn&rsquo;t belong?</p>\n<p>A. \\(5+2+2+2+2+2+2\\)</p>\n<p>B. \\(5+6 \\cdot 2\\)</p>\n<p>C. \\(5 \\cdot 2^6\\)</p>\n<p>D. \\(5 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2\\)</p>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<p>Sample responses:</p>\n<p>A doesn&rsquo;t belong because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n    It is the only expression with repeated addition.\n  </li>\n<li>\n    It is the only expression that only has addition.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>B doesn&rsquo;t belong because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n    It is the only expression with both addition and multiplication.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>C doesn&rsquo;t belong because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n    It is the only expression with an exponent.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>D doesn&rsquo;t belong because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n    It is the only expression with repeated multiplication.\n  </li>\n<li>\n    It is the only expression that only has multiplication.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Ask each group to share one reason why a particular item does not belong. Record and display the responses for all to see. After each response, ask the class if they agree or disagree. Since there is no single correct answer to the question of which one does not belong, attend to students&rsquo; explanations and ensure the reasons given are correct.</p>\n<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t come up during the discussion, highlight the fact that A and B are equivalent expressions, and C and D are equivalent expressions.</p>"
