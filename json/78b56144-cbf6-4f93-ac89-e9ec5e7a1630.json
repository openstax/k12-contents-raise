You will also write linear inequalities to represent the constraints in situations and then use the representations (including the graphs of the solutions) to answer questions about the situations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use graphing technology to find the solution to a two-variable inequality.</li>\n<li>Connect the different representations and interpret them in terms of the situation, when given inequalities, graphs, and descriptions that represent the constraints in a situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2.12.1: Graphing Inequalities with Technology</li>\n<li>2.12.2: Solving Problems with Inequalities in Two Variables</li>\n<li>2.12.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li>2.12.3: Matching Representations of Inequalities&nbsp;</li>\n<li>2.12.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li>2.12.4: Graphing Solutions to an Inequality</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After that, you&rsquo;ll<strong> practice and review.</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2.12.5: Practice</li>\n<li>2.12.6: Summary</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>"
