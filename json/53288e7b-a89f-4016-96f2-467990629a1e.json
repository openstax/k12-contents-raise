Another way to think about this is that the car retains \\(\\frac23\\) of its value each year.

Sample explanation: If the car loses a third of its value each year, then after one year its value will be \\(\\frac23\\) of $18,000 or $12,000. After two years its value will be \\(\\frac23\\) of $12,000 or $8,000. And after three years its value will be \\(\\frac23\\) of $8,000 or about $5,333. The buyer might have thought that &ldquo;losing a third of its value each year&rdquo; meant losing $6,000 each year, so after 3 years the car would be worthless (because \\(3 \\cdot 6,000=18,000\\)).
