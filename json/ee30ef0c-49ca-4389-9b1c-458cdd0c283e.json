Students solve several simple equations by finding square roots and express their solutions using the notation.</p>\n<p>Students also see that sometimes the solutions are not rational numbers and can be expressed exactly using the radical notation rather than using their decimal approximations. For example, the solutions to \\(x^2=24\\) can be written as \\(x= \\pm \\sqrt{24}\\) rather than \\(x \\approx \\pm 4.9\\) and the solutions to \\((x-3)^2=24\\) can be written as \\(x= \\pm \\sqrt{24}+3\\) instead of \\(x \\approx \\pm 4.9+3\\).</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Remind students that we have seen that some quadratic equations have two solutions. Take the equation \\(x^2=25\\), for example. For the equation to be true, \\(x\\) can be 5 and -5 because \\(5^2=25\\) and \\((-5)^2=25\\). We have been writing the solutions as: \\(x=5\\) and \\(x=-5\\). Explain that a shorter way to convey the same information is by writing \\(x= \\pm 5\\).</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>Solve each equation. Use the notation when appropriate and express radicals in simplest form.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>\\(x^2-13=-12\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(x= \\pm 1\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n  <li>\\((x-6)^2=0\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 6<br>\n  \\(x = 6\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\">\n  <li>\\(x^2+9=0\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> No real solution</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"4\">\n  <li>\\(x^2=18\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(x= \\pm 3 \\sqrt{2}\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"5\">\n  <li>\\(x^2+1=18\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(x= \\pm \\sqrt{17}\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"6\">\n  <li>\\((x+1)^2=18\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(x=-1 \\pm 3 \\sqrt{2}\\) (or equivalent)</p>\n<h4>Video: Solving Quadratics with Square Roots</h4>\n<p>Watch the following video to learn more about equations with solutions that are square roots.</p>\n<video controls=\"true\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" width=\"550\">\n  <source src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/5033df694da12da637450b921dc619cad59325d5\">\n  <track default=\"true\" kind=\"captions\" label=\"On\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/f1c6a8c5098e8a0f5f42b17eb9e7657158c4201d\" srclang=\"en_us\">https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/5033df694da12da637450b921dc619cad59325d5\n</video>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>\n<p>When using \\(\\pm\\) the notation for the first time, some students may struggle to remember that it shows a number and its opposite. Encourage those students to continue writing their answers both ways in this lesson to reinforce the meaning of the new notation. Show students how both solutions work in the original equation by checking the answers.</p>\n<p>Some students may still struggle to understand the meaning of the square root. Watch for students who evaluate a square root by dividing by 2. Ask these students what the square root of 9 is. If this does not convince students that dividing by two is the incorrect operation, demonstrate that we call 3 a square root of 9 because \\(3 \\cdot 3=9\\).</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Invite students to share their solutions. Record and display the solutions for all to see. Discuss any disagreements, if there are any.</p>\n<p>Draw students' attention to the last three sets of solutions, which are irrational. Ask students to recall the meaning of rational numbers and irrational numbers. Remind students that a rational number is a fraction or its opposite, for example: 12, -7, \\(\\frac18\\), \\(-\\frac18\\), 90.38, or 0.005. Irrational numbers are numbers that are not rational, for example: \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), \\(\\pi\\), and \\(\\sqrt{10}\\). (Students will have more opportunities to review and classify rational and irrational numbers later in the unit, so for now, it suffices that they remember that an irrational number is a number that is not rational.)</p>\n<p>Highlight that when the solution is irrational, the most concise way to write an exact solution is, for example, \\(x= \\pm \\sqrt{18}-1\\). Writing this in decimal form only allows us to write an approximate solution. For example, in this case, 3.24 and -5.24 are approximate solutions.</p>\n<p>Then, display the variations in writing the solutions to \\((x+1)^2=18\\) for all to see. Discuss how they are all different ways of writing the same two solutions.</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> \\(x= \\pm \\sqrt{18}-1\\) </li>\n  <li> \\(x= \\sqrt{18}-1\\) and \\(x=- \\sqrt{18}-1\\) </li>\n  <li> \\(x=-1 \\pm \\sqrt{18}\\) </li>\n  <li> \\(x=-1+ \\sqrt{18}\\) and \\(x=-1- \\sqrt{18}\\) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will likely need review on simplifying radicals. Highlight that simplifying a radical does not mean that it is rational. So \\(\\sqrt{18}\\) is irrational and so is \\(3 \\sqrt{2}\\).</p>\n<h3> 9.5.2: Self Check </h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION</strong>:</p>\n        <p>Solve \\(x^2-3=19\\).</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x=-4\\), \\(x=4\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incorrect.

Students will not automatically have access to this content, so you may wish to share it with those who could benefit from it.</em></strong></p>\n<h4>Solving Quadratics with Radical Solutions</h4>\n<p>When solving quadratic equations, it is important to remember that:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Any positive number has two square roots, one positive and one negative, because there are two numbers that can be squared to make that number. (For example, \\(6^2 \\)and \\((-6)^2\\) both equal 36, so 6 and -6 are both square roots of 36.) </li>\n  <li> The square root symbol \\((\\sqrt{\\;\\;})\\) can be used to express the positive square root of a number. For example, the square root of 36 is 6, but it can also be written as \\(\\sqrt{36}\\) because \\(\\sqrt{36} \\cdot \\sqrt{36}=36\\). </li>\n  <li> To express the negative square root of a number, say 36, we can write -6 or \\(-\\sqrt{36}\\). </li>\n  <li> When a number is not a perfect square, for example, 40, we can express its square roots by writing 40 and \\(-\\sqrt{40}\\). </li>\n</ul>\n<p>How could we write the solutions to an equation like \\((x+4)^2=11\\)? This equation is saying, &ldquo;something squared is 11.&rdquo; To make the equation true, that something must be \\(\\sqrt{11}\\) or \\(-\\sqrt{11}\\).</p>\n<p>We can write:</p>\n<p>\\(x+4= \\sqrt{11}\\) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \\(x+4= - \\sqrt{11}\\)</p>\n<p>\\(x=-4+ \\sqrt{11}\\) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \\(x=-4+- \\sqrt{11}\\) </p>\n<p>A more compact way to write the two solutions to the equation is: \\(x=-4 \\pm \\sqrt{11}\\).</p>\n<h4>Try It: Solving Quadratics with Radical Solutions</h4>\n<p>Solve \\((x-2)^2=17\\).</p>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n<h5>Solution</h5>\n<p>Here is how to solve this quadratic equation:</p>\n<p>Step 1<br>\n  Make sure the quadratic is isolated on one side.<br>\n  \\((x-2)^2=17\\)</p>\n<p>Step 2<br>\n  Take the square root of both sides.<br>\n  \\(\\sqrt{(x-2)^2}= \\pm \\sqrt{17}\\)</p>\n<p>Step 3<br>\n  Simplify.<br>\n  \\(x-2= \\pm \\sqrt{17}\\)</p>\n<p>Step 4<br>\n  Solve the equation.
