Students start by multiplying with monomials. This involves a review of the properties of exponents and the Distributive Property. Multiple methods are then introduced to practice multiplying two binomials.</p>\n<p>The previously introduced Vertical Alignment and distribution will be used to multiply polynomials by other polynomials. As students learn these methods better, they will weigh their advantages and disadvantages. They will learn to recognize special situations in which patterns can be learned and implemented to efficiently multiply these binomials together. Finally, students will use their previous knowledge of polynomial functions to further practice the multiplication they have learned in this lesson.</p>\n<h4> Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Multiply monomials together using multiplication properties of exponents. </li>\n<li> Multiply polynomials together using the Distributive Property, Vertical Alignment, and the FOIL method (for binomials). </li>\n<li> Recognize special case products such as binomial squares and conjugate pairs and use designated rules to facilitate their multiplication. </li>\n<li> Multiply polynomials expressed in function form. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4> Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li> Multiply monomials. </li>\n<li> Multiply a polynomial by a monomial. </li>\n<li> Multiply binomials. </li>\n<li> Multiply a polynomial by a polynomial. </li>\n<li> Multiply special products. </li>\n<li> Multiply polynomial functions. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<colgroup>\n<col>\n<col>\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>A10(B) multiply polynomials of degree one and degree two;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 6.2.1: Multiplying Monomials </li>\n<li> 6.2.2: Multiplying Binomials </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 6.2.2: Self Check </li>\n<li> 6.2.2: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 6.2.3: Multiplying a Polynomial by a Polynomial </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 6.2.3: Self Check </li>\n<li> 6.2.3: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 6.2.4: Multiplying Special Products </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 6.2.4: Self Check </li>\n<li> 6.2.4: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 6.2.5: Multiplying Polynomial Functions </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 6.2.6: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Paper and pencil </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>None </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson.
