Ask students:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&ldquo;How would you describe to a classmate who is absent today what each equation means? What would you say to help them make sense of these?&rdquo; (Each equation gives the rule of a function. The rule for \\(f\\) says that, to get the output, we multiply the input by 5 and add 3. The rule for \\(g\\) says that the output is 10 times the input, minus 4.)</li>\n<li>&ldquo;How do the rules help us find the value of \\(f(10)\\) or \\(g(10)\\)?&rdquo; (If we substitute 10 for \\(x\\) in each equation and evaluate the expression, we would have the values of \\(f\\) or \\(g\\) at \\(x=10\\), which are 53 and 96, respectively.)</li>\n<li>&ldquo;Is it possible to graph a function described this way? How?&rdquo; (We could create a table of values and find the coordinate pairs at different \\(x\\)-values. Or, if a rule is expressed as a linear equation, we could use it to identify the slope and vertical intercept of the graph.)</li>\n</ul>"
