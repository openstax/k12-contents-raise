It reinforced your knowledge that an object that travels at a constant speed can be described with a linear function. </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 7.6.2: The Force of Gravity Change in Quadratic Functions </li>\n<ul>\n<li> In this activity, you learned a model that accounts for the fact that an object that is launched straight up at a constant speed does not keep going at the same rate when the influence of gravity is taken into account. The big lesson was that adding a quadratic term to a linear function has an effect of &ldquo;bending&rdquo; the graph, as the output values are no longer changing at a constant rate. </li>\n<li> 7.6.2: Self Check </li>\n<li> 7.6.2: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 7.6.3: Using Quadratic Functions to Describe Height </li>\n<ul>\n<li> In this activity, you explored another model of a projectile motion. You graphed and interpreted a quadratic function in context and began considering a reasonable domain for the function. </li>\n<li> 7.6.3: Self Check </li>\n<li> 7.6.3: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 7.6.4: Interpreting Graphs of Quadratic Functions </li>\n<ul>\n<li> In this activity, you examined a quadratic function and its graph and identified what each term of the equation meant in the context of the situation graphed. </li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li> 7.6.5: Practice </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<!--pulldown-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n<p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<p>Correct!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!--Do not edit below line.-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n</div>"
