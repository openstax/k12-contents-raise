Would you still choose to solve it by substitution now? Why or why not?&rdquo;</li>\n      <li>&ldquo;Look at a system that you would <em>not</em> have chosen to solve by substitution. Would it help to solve by elimination? Why or why not?&rdquo;</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>With a little bit of rearranging (of the equations), all of these systems could be solved by substitution or elimination. Students should at least recognize that systems 1 and 3 can be solved efficiently by elimination, while system 2 can be solved efficiently by substitution.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"student-summary\">\n  <div class=\"body\">\n  </div>\n</div>"
