Ensure that you and your partner agree on each arrangement before moving on to the next one. Sort all the cards in order from:</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n  <li>best to worst for representing with a linear model</li>\n  <li>least to greatest slope of a linear model that fits the data well</li>\n  <li>least to greatest vertical intercept of a linear model that fits the data well</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<p>Know that the <span class=\"os-raise-ib-tooltip\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\" data-store=\"glossary-tooltip\">line of best fit</span> is the line that provides the best fit to the data. It should follow the trend of the data and go through the middle of the data with a similar number of points on each side of the line.</p>\n<!--Text Entry Interaction Start -->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"eventShow\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-content\">\n    <ol>\n      <li>What is the order of the cards that displays the best to worst representations of a linear model?</li>\n    </ol>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-prompt\">\n    <p>Enter your answer here:</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-ack\">\n    <p>Compare your answers:</p>\n    <ol type=\"a\">\n      <li>For example: B, E, A and F, C, D, and G.
