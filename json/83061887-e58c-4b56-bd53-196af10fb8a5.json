They use it to reason about the solutions to quadratic equations that each have a quadratic expression in factored form on one side and 0 on the other side. They see that when an expression is a product of two or more factors and that product is 0, one of the factors must be 0. This fact enables us to find unknown values in the factored expression.</p>\n<p>Students also continue to make connections to their earlier work on quadratic functions. They have seen that sometimes we want to find the input values of a function when the output is zero. They also learned that the factored form can help us identify the zeros of a quadratic function and the \\(x\\)-intercepts of its graph. They have not investigated how or why this form enables us to do so, however. Here, students make use of the structure of a quadratic expression in factored form and the zero product property to understand the connections between the numbers in the form and the \\(x\\)-intercepts of its graph.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Given quadratic equations where one side is a product of factors and the other is zero, find the solution(s) and explain (orally and in writing) why the solutions make the equation true. </li>\n  <li> Explain (in written and spoken language) that the \"zero product property\" means that if the product of two numbers is 0, then one of the factors must also be 0. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Explain the meaning of the \"zero product property.\"</li>\n  <li> Find solutions to quadratic equations when one side is a product of factors and the other side is zero. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>A8(A) solve quadratic equations having real solutions by factoring, taking square roots, completing the square, and applying the quadratic formula.</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Foundational: Lesson provides foundational content necessary for students to be able to perform this TEKS in later lessons.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> 8.4.1: Introducing the Zero Product Property </li>\n  <li> 8.4.2: Solving Equations of Increasing Complexity Using Reasoning </li>\n  <ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n    <li> 8.4.2: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 8.4.2: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 8.4.3: Applying the Zero Product Property to Solve a Real-World Projectile Problem </li>\n  <ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n    <li> 8.4.3: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 8.4.3: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 8.4.4: Solving Equations Using the Zero Product Property and Reasoning </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 8.4.5: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Paper and pencil </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> None </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson. </li>\n  <li> Encourage students to look for these words and notice their use and meanings. </li>\n  <li> Encourage students to use key vocabulary words in \"math talk\" and their written and oral explanations. </li>\n  <li> Utilize a word wall.
