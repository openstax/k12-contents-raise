In each situation, the value of at least one quantity is not given, creating a need for students to name it by using a word or a phrase (for instance, &ldquo;total price&rdquo; or &ldquo;original price&rdquo;) or to use a variable (for example,&nbsp;<span>\\( T \\)</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span>\\( p \\)</span>). Some students might choose to use a symbol. Monitor for the different ways students represent these quantities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <h3>Launch</h3>\n    <div>\n      <p>Ask students if they have had to pay sales tax when making a purchase and, if so, to briefly explain how sales tax works.</p>\n      <p>Explain to students that a car purchase also involves a sales tax. Car buyers pay not only the price of a car, but also a tax that is a certain&nbsp;<span>percentage</span>&nbsp;of the car price. Car dealerships also often charge their customers various fees.</p>\n      <p>Tell students that they will now write&nbsp;<span>equations</span>&nbsp;to describe the relationship between the price of the car, the tax, a fee, and the total price. Emphasize that it is not necessary to evaluate any&nbsp;<span>expressions</span>&nbsp;or perform any computations.</p>\n      <p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Give them a few minutes of quiet work time and then a minute to discuss their responses with a partner. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>\n    <div>\n      <p>The tax on the sale of a car in Michigan is 6%. At a dealership in Ann Arbor, a car purchase also involves $120 in miscellaneous charges.</p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>\n          <p>There are several quantities in this situation: the original car price, sales tax, miscellaneous charges, and total price. Write an equation to describe the relationship between all the quantities when:</p>\n          <ol>\n            <li>The original car price is&nbsp;<span>$</span>9,500.</li>\n            <li>The original car price is&nbsp;<span>$</span>14,699.</li>\n            <li>The total price is $22,480.</li>\n            <li>The original price is&nbsp;<span>\\( p \\)</span>.<br><br></li>\n          </ol>\n        </li>\n        <li>How would each equation you wrote change if the tax on car sales is&nbsp;<span>\\( r \\)%</span>&nbsp;and the miscellaneous charges are&nbsp;<span>\\( m \\)</span>&nbsp;dollars?</li>\n      </ol>\n    </div>\n    <h3>Student Response</h3>\n    <div>\n      <ol>\n        <li>Sample responses:<ol>\n            <li><span>\\( T=9,\\!500 + 0.06 (9,\\!500) + 120 \\)</span>, or&nbsp;<span>\\( T=1.06 (9,\\!500) + 120 \\)</span></li>\n            <li><span>\\( T=14,\\!699 + 0.06 (14,\\!699) + 120 \\)</span>, or&nbsp;<span>\\( T=1.06 (14,\\!699) + 120 \\)</span></li>\n            <li><span>\\( 22,\\!480=p + 0.06p + 120 \\)</span>, or&nbsp;<span>\\( 22,\\!480=1.06p + 120 \\)</span></li>\n            <li><span>\\( T=p + 0.06p + 120 \\)</span>, or&nbsp;<span>\\( T=1.06p +120 \\)<br><br></span></li>\n          </ol>\n        </li>\n        <li>Equations equivalent to these are also acceptable:<ol>\n            <li><span>\\( T=9,\\!500 + \\frac{r}{100} (9,\\!500) + m \\)</span></li>\n            <li><span>\\( T=14,\\!699 + \\frac{r}{100} (14,\\!699) + m \\)</span></li>\n            <li><span>\\( 22,\\!480=p + \\frac{r}{100}(p) + m \\)</span></li>\n            <li><span>\\( T=p + \\frac{r}{100} (p) + m \\)</span></li>\n          </ol>\n        </li>\n      </ol>\n    </div>\n    <h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>\n    <div>\n      <p>Some students may be taken aback by the prompt to write an<span>&nbsp;expression</span>&nbsp;relating four quantities. If they have trouble getting started, suggest that they simply calculate the cost of buying a&nbsp;<span>$</span>9,500 car, taking care to show their work.</p>\n      <p>One part of the first question gives the total price of the purchase rather than the original price of the car. If students use the given value as an original price, ask them to double-check the given information.</p>\n      <p>In the last question, students may struggle to represent&nbsp;<span>\\( r \\)%</span>&nbsp;algebraically. Some students may multiply the price by&nbsp;<span>\\( r \\)</span>, and others may write&nbsp;<span>\\( 0.0r \\)</span>. Urge students to look at their work in the first question. Ask them: &ldquo;By what number did you multiply the car price? What operation turns the number 6 into 0.06?&rdquo;</p>\n    </div>\n    <h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>\n    <div>\n      <p>Select students whose equations are equivalent but in different forms to share their responses. Record and display them for all to see. Then, draw students&rsquo; attention to the first and last equation in each question.</p>\n      <p>For the first question, the equations might be:&nbsp;<span>\\( T=9,\\!500 + 0.06(9,\\!500) + 120 \\)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>\\( T=p+0.06p+ 120 \\)</span>. Ask students:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>&ldquo;In the first equation, what quantities do we know?&rdquo; (the original price of the car, the tax rate, and the miscellaneous charges) &ldquo;When might it be useful to write an equation like this?&rdquo; (when we know all relevant quantities except for one)</li>\n        <li>&ldquo;In the other equation, what quantities do we know?&rdquo; (the tax rate and the miscellaneous charges) &ldquo;When might it be useful to write an equation like this?&rdquo; (when we want to have a kind of formula for finding the total price for a car of any price, assuming the tax rate and miscellaneous charges are fixed at 6% and&nbsp;<span>$</span>120, respectively)</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>For the second question, the equations might be:&nbsp;<span>\\( T=9,\\!500+\\frac{r}{100}(9,\\!500)+m \\)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>\\( T=p+\\frac{r}{100} (p)+m \\)</span>. Ask students:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>&ldquo;In the first equation, what quantities do we know?&rdquo; (the original price of the car) &ldquo;When might it be useful to write an equation like this?&rdquo; (when we want to know the total cost of a&nbsp;<span>$</span>9,500 car but don&rsquo;t know the tax rate or other fees)</li>\n        <li>&ldquo;In the other equation, what quantities do we know?&rdquo; (none) &ldquo;Why might it be helpful to write an equation like this?&rdquo; (It helps us see the relationship of all the quantities that are relevant in the situation. It is flexible in that it can be used to find the total cost for any car price, tax rate, and miscellaneous charges.)</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>Emphasize that we might choose to use letters to represent quantities that vary or those that are constant, depending on what we want to understand or know.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"student-summary\">\n      <div class=\"body\">\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2>1.2.4: Self Check</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Following the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>QUESTION:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n        <p>Sweet&rsquo;s Candy Store charges $5.00 to fill a bag of candy.
