You also recalled that a linear equation in two variables has many solutions, which are represented by all the points on the graph of the equation. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li>2.10.2: Self Check</li>\n  <li>2.10.3: Sketching Solutions to Inequalities</li>\n  <ul>\n    <li>In this activity, you looked at the regions that represent solutions and non-solutions to inequalities. You recognized that the boundary between the two regions is the graph of an equation that is related to the inequality.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <li>2.10.3: Self Check</li>\n  <li>2.10.4: Shading Boundary Line Regions</li>\n  <ul>\n    <li>In this activity, you considered how to make decisions about which side of the boundary line to shade.</li>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>2.10.5: Practice</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In </h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <!--Q1-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n      <p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n      <p>Correct!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n      <p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!----------------- Must be included at the bottom of page for dropdown to work ------------>\n  <!--Do not edit below line.-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n</div>"
