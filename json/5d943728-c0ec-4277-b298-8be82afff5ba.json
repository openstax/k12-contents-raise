If not, completing these resources can help you get a better understanding of these concepts:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Determine if an ordered pair is a solution to a linear equation.</li>\n  <li>Use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation to find its slope and y-intercept.</li>\n  <li>Find the x- and y-intercepts of a line when given its equation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are still struggling, be sure to reach out to your teacher for additional help. Nobody is good at problems like this the first try. Keep at it and it will get easier.</p>\n<p>To continue with the unit, select &ldquo;Section A Overview: Linear Systems&rdquo; below. Otherwise, select the button to re-review these concepts.</p>"
