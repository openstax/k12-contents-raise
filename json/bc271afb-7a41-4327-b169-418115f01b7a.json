Students write inequalities in two variables to represent constraints in situations, use technology to graph the solutions, interpret points in the solution regions, and use the inequalities and the graphs to answer contextual questions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The questions in this activity are written in pairs. The same constraints and contexts will be used in an upcoming lesson on systems of linear inequalities in two variables.</p>\n<p>Decide on the structure for the activity depending on the time available and the amount of practice each student needs. Here are some possibilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assigning all three pairs of questions to all students.</li>\n<li>Assigning each student a pair of questions, arranging students who work on different pairs in groups of 3, and asking them to explain their solutions to one another.</li>\n<li>Arranging students in groups of 3, assigning the same pair of questions to each group, and-for each pair of questions-asking one group to present the solutions to the class.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3>Launch</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Continue to provide access to graphing technology. Explain that students will now write and graph inequalities to solve problems about some situations.</p>\n<p>Assign at least one pair of questions about the same context to each student. See Activity Narrative for some possible ways to structure the activity.</p>\n<p>Some students might not be familiar with terms such as \"savings,\" \"checking,\" or \"premium.\" Explain any unfamiliar terms as needed.</p>\n<h4>Support for Students with Disabilities</h4>\n<div>\n<p><em></em><i>E</i><em>ngagement: Provide Access by Recruiting Interest.</em>&nbsp;Leverage choice around perceived challenge. Chunking this task into more manageable parts may also support students who benefit from additional processing time. Invite students to select one of the situations to work on. If students are arranged in groups, each member should be prepared to share during the whole-class discussion.<br><em>Supports accessibility for: Attention; Social-emotional skills</em><em></em></p>\n</div>\n<div><br></div>\n</div>\n<h3>Student Facing Statement</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Here are three types of situations.

Some students might think that all inequalities they write must include two variables. Reassure them that this might not always be the case. Consider pointing to examples from earlier activities in which they wrote or graphed inequalities such as&nbsp;\\( y&gt;2 \\)&nbsp;or&nbsp;\\( b&lt;10 \\).</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Select one student or one group to present their solutions for each pair of questions. Focus the discussion on how students used the inequalities and graphs to help answer the question about each situation.</p>\n<p>Students who worked on the same questions might end up with different graphs and answers because they wrote different inequalities (which might not correctly represent the constraints in the situation). If this happens, analyze the different inequalities and look for the potential causes for the discrepancy. One possibility is that the wrong symbols or the wrong numbers were entered into the graphing tool.</p>\n<p>Another possibility might be that students made different decisions about the quantities being assigned to the vertical and horizontal axes. In that case, both versions of the graphs might be correct, but the answers to questions might be different if one of the graphs is not interpreted correctly.</p>\n</div>\n<h4>2.12.2: Self Check&nbsp;</h4>\n<p><strong><em>Following the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>QUESTION:<br></strong>Use graphing technology to\n        solve the following problem.<p><span lang=\"EN\"><br>Jacob charges $20 to mow a\n            lawn in his neighborhood and $100 to paint a room.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<span lang=\"EN\">Which combination of\n          jobs earns Jacob more than $1,000?</span><br>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>ANSWERS</strong></td>\n<td><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span lang=\"EN\">Jacob mows 10 lawns and paints 8 rooms.</span></td>\n<td>Incorrect.

One at a grocery store that pays $10 an hour and the other is babysitting for $13 per hour. Between the two jobs, Hugh wants to earn at least $260 a week. How many hours does Hugh need to work at each job to earn at least $260?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>a. Let&nbsp;\\( x \\) be the number of hours he works at the grocery store and let&nbsp;\\( y \\) be the number of hours he works babysitting. Write an inequality that would model this situation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>b. Graph the inequality.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>c. Find three ordered pairs&nbsp;\\( (x, y) \\) that would be solutions to the inequality. Then, explain what that means for Hugh.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>\n<p>a. \\( 10x+13y&ge;260 \\)</p>\n<p>b.</p>\n<p><img alt class=\"img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom\" height=\"309\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/50559651dc86edfbe4480e8f4358916046348fea\" width=\"300\"><br></p>\n<p>c. Answers will vary. Sample answers: \\( (20, 10) \\), \\( (15, 20) \\), \\( (10, 25) \\); For each of these coordinate points, if Hugh worked&nbsp;\\( x \\) hours at the grocery store and&nbsp;\\( y \\) hours babysitting, he would earn at least $260.</p>\n<p>How did you do?
