What does this mean in this situation? Is it realistic?&nbsp;</span><span>The \\(y\\)-intercept is \\((0,18)\\). What does this mean in this situation? Is it realistic?</span></p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> The slope means that for every increase of 1 waitstaff, the wait time decreases 1.62 minutes. This is a realistic slope. The \\(y\\)-intercept means that with 0 staff, the wait time is 18 minutes. This is not realistic when there are no staff available.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>The company&rsquo;s pricing plan states that the usage rate is constant for any number of minutes connected to the Internet. The number of minutes is related to the cost in dollars and has a linear relationship. The equation of the line is \\(y = 0.03x +0.10\\).
