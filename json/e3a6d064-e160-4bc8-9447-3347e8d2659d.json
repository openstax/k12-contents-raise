One function measured the distance the object traveled from its starting point, and the other measured its distance from the ground. How are the representations of these functions alike and different?&rdquo; (The equations both have \\(16t^2\\), but one is positive and the other negative. Their graphs are both curves, but one graph curves upward and the other downward. The values in one table show increasing values, and the others show decreasing values, but they change by the same amounts from row to row.) </li>\n<li> &ldquo;How are these functions like or unlike those representing visual patterns in earlier lessons?&rdquo; (They can all be represented by quadratic expressions. The relationships between the step number and the number of squares or dots were easier to see. The relationships between time and distance are not as obvious.) </li>\n<li> &ldquo;How are the graphs representing falling objects like or unlike those representing visual patterns?&rdquo; (The graphs representing the patterns curved upward. They showed plotted points at whole-number inputs because non-whole-number steps would not make sense. In this lesson, we saw graphs that curved upward and downward. The graphs can be continuous because we can measure the distances even when the number of seconds is fractional.) </li>\n</ul>"
