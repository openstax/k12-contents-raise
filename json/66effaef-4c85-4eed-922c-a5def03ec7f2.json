Students will learn how to recognize direct variation situations. They will set up direct variation equations and work to find the constant of variation to apply the direct variation equation to solve problems.</p>\n        <p>In applications using direct variation, students will know the values of one pair of the variables and will be asked to find the equation that relates \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Then they can use that equation to find values of \\( y \\) for other values of \\( x \\).</p>\n      </div>\n      <h3>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h3>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div>\n  <div class=\"main\">\n    <div class=\"preparation\"><span>Students will be able to:</span></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div>\n  <div class=\"main\">\n    <div class=\"preparation\">\n      <ul>\n        <li>Identify variables and set up a direct variation proportion, given a description of a situation.</li>\n        <li>Solve a direct variation proportion.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li><span>Set up and solve direct variation problems.</span><br></li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h3>\n      <strong>\n        <div dir=\"ltr\">\n          <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n            <colgroup>\n              <col>\n              <col>\n            </colgroup>\n            <tbody>\n              <tr>\n                <td>\n                  <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>TEKS</span></p>\n                </td>\n                <td>\n                  <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Explanation of Coverage</span></p>\n                </td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>\n                  <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A2(D) write and solve equations involving direct variation;&nbsp;</span></p>\n                </td>\n                <td>\n                  <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</span></p>\n                </td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>\n                  <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A2(C) <u>write linear equations in two variables given</u> a table of values, a graph, and a <u>verbal description</u>.</span></p>\n                </td>\n                <td>\n                  <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Partial coverage: Lesson provides content that covers part of this TEKS.
