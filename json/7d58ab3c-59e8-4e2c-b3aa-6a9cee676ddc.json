Students have encountered the same situations and constraints in a previous lesson, so the main work here is on thinking about each pair of constraints as a system, finding the solution region of each inequality, and identifying a point in the region where the graphs overlap as a solution to the system.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 2&ndash;4. Explain to students that they will now revisit some situations they have seen and graphed in an earlier lesson. Assign one situation to each group member (or allow them to choose one situation) and ask them to answer the questions. Provide access to graphing technology.</p>\n<p>Give students 5&ndash;6 minutes of quiet work time, and then give them time to discuss their responses and graph with their group.</p>\n<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>\n<div>\n  <p>Use this routine to support small-group discussion. At the appropriate time, give students 2&ndash;3 minutes to plan what they will say when they present their responses and graph to their group. Encourage students to consider what details are important to share and to think about how they will explain their reasoning using mathematical language.</p>\n</div>\n<h4><br></h4>\n<h4>Support for Students with Disabilities</h4>\n<div>\n  <p><em>Action and Expression: Internalize Executive Functions. </em>To support development of organizational skills, check in with students within the first 2&ndash;3 minutes of work time. Look for students who are organizing their information, understanding the need for two equations, and strategizing as to how to overlay them onto a single graph.</p>\n  <p><em>Supports accessibility for: Memory; Organization</em></p>\n</div>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are some situations you have seen before.
