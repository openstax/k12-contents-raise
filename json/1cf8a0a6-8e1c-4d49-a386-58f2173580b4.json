Each graph was a continuous graph.</p>\n<p>In this optional activity, students compare <strong>functions</strong> represented in separate graphs. Each graph is a discrete graph, showing the viewership of three TV shows as <strong>functions</strong> of the episode number. Students interpret features of the graphs and relate them to descriptions about the shows and to statements in <strong>functions</strong> notation. They use their analyses to draw conclusions about the popularity of the shows and to sketch a possible graph for a fourth TV show.</p>\n<p>The work here requires students to make sense of quantities and their relationships while attending to their representations. In sketching a graph that matches a description, students need to be careful about showing correspondence to the quantities in the situation, including by using appropriate scale and marks.</p>\n<h4>Launch </h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Give students a few minutes of quiet work time, then time to discuss their thinking with their partner. Follow with a whole-class discussion.\n</p>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement </h4>\n<p>The number of people who watched a TV episode is a function of that show&rsquo;s episode number.

Ask students to explain how parts of the descriptions and features of the graphs led them to believe that a pair of representations belong together.</p>\n  <p>Next, invite students to share their graph of the fourth TV show. Display the graphs for all to see and discuss how the graphs are alike and how they are different. Because each graph is created based on the same description, they should share some common features. If they look drastically different, solicit possible reasons. (Possible explanations include differences in interpretation of the description or in the choice of scale for the vertical axis, errors in reading the description, and plotting errors.)</p>\n  <p>If time permits, ask students,</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\"How are the graphs or the functions in this activity different than those in earlier activities?\" (They show points rather than lines. The input is episode number, while in other cases, the input was time. Each function is shown on a different coordinate plane.)</li>\n    <li>\"How is the work of comparing functions here like comparing functions in earlier activities?\" (They all involve comparing the output values of points on a graph, interpreting the points, making sense of verbal descriptions, and some estimating.)</li>\n    <li>\"How is the work of comparing functions here different than in earlier activities?\" (Here we are comparing function values across three separate graphs, which is trickier than when the graphs are all on the same coordinate plane. Figuring out which function has a greater or lesser value was also easier when the functions were represented with lines or curves. It is harder to do with a set of points, especially when they are not in the same image.)</li>\n  </ul>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>\n  <p><i>Speaking, Representing: MLR8 Discussion Supports.</i> Use this routine to support whole-class discussion as students explain how they matched the description to the graph. Display the following sentence frames for all to see: \"_____ matches _____ because . . .\" and \"I noticed _____, so . . . .\" Encourage students to challenge each other when they disagree. This routine will help students explain how they used parts of the descriptions and features of the graphs to find matches.</p>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <h4>4.9.3 Self Check</h4>\n  <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n    <colgroup>\n      <col>\n      <col>\n    </colgroup>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td colspan=\"2\">\n          <p><strong>QUESTION: </strong></p>\n          <p>For which of the following functions is f(3) the greatest value?</p>\n          <br>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p><img height=\"200\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/5befd6e8c4d33d35cd00f68c62eac7fdaebbaee2\"></p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p>Incorrect.
