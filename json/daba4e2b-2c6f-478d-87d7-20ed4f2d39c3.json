Check your partner&rsquo;s graph and equation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. Draw a point on your partner&rsquo;s paper that is not on the line. Label the point \\( P \\).<br><br><span>3.

Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p><br>"
