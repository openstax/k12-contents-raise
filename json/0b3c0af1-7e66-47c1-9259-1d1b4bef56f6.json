They then\n  graph these equations on the same coordinate plane that shows the graphs of the\n  original system. Students notice that no new graphs appear on the coordinate\n  plane and reason about why this might be the case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The work here reminds students that equations that are\n  equivalent have all the same solutions, so their graphs are also identical.\n  Later, students will rely on this insight to explain why we can multiply one\n  equation in a system by a factor&mdash;which produces an equivalent equation&mdash;and\n  solve a new system containing that equation instead.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div>\n  <p></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <h4>Launch</h4>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Display the equation \\( x+5=11 \\) for all to see. Ask students:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\"What is the solution to this\n    equation?\" \\( (x=6) \\)\n  </li>\n  <li>\"If we multiply both sides of the equation\n    by a factor, say, 4, what equation would we have?\" \\( (4x + 20 = 44) \\) \"What is the solution to this new equation?\"\n    \\( (x = 6) \\)\n  </li>\n  <li>What if we multiply both sides by 100?\"\n    \\( (100x+500=1,100) \\) \"By 0.5?\" \\( (0.5x+2.5=5.5) \\)\n  </li>\n  <li>\"Is the solution to each of these equations\n    still \\( x=6 \\)?\" (Yes)\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Remind students that these equations are one-variable\n  equations, and that multiplying both sides of a one-variable equation by the\n  same factor produces an equivalent equation with the same solution. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ask students: \"What if we multiply both sides of a\n  two-variable equation by the same factor? Would the resulting equation have the\n  same solutions as the original equation?\" Tell students that they will now\n  investigate this question by graphing. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 2&ndash;4 and provide access to\n  graphing technology to each group. To save time, consider asking group members\n  to divide up the tasks. (For example, one person could be in charge of graphing\n  while the others write equivalent equations, and everyone analyze the graphs\n  together.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<div>\n  <p></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Consider two equations in a system:</p>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"col\"><span>\\( \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{c l} 4x+ y=1\\\\ x+2y=9 \\end{array}\\right. \\)<span> </span></span></th>\n      <th scope=\"col\"><span>Equation A<br>Equation B</span></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>1. Use graphing\n  technology to graph the equations. Then, identify the coordinates of the\n  solution.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2. Write\n  a few equations that are equivalent to equation A by multiplying both\n  sides by the same number, for example, 2, -5, or\n  \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)&nbsp;.

Ask students why the graphs of equations A1, A2, and A3 all coincide with the graphs of the original equation A. Discuss with students:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\"How can we explain the identical\n    graphs?\" (Equations A1, A2, and A3 are equivalent to equation A, so they\n    all have the same solutions as equation A, and their graphs are the same lines\n    as the graphs of A.)\n  </li>\n  <li>\"What move was made to generate A1, A2, and\n    A3? Why did it create equations that are equivalent to A?\" (The two sides\n    of equation A was multiplied by the same factor, which keeps the two sides\n    equal.)\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To further\n  illustrate that equations A1, A2, and A3 are equivalent to equation A, and if\n  time permits, consider:</p>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><span>Using tables to visualize the identical&nbsp;</span><span>\\( (x, y) \\)</span><span> pairs.
