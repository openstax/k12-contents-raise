For a situation characterized by exponential decay, however, a smaller value of \\(b\\) (between 0 and 1) corresponds to faster decay. Understanding how the parameter \\(b\\) influences the graph of an exponential function will prepare students to make sense of and model situations involving repeated percentage change later in the unit.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Present the following scenario: &ldquo;Suppose you are presented with four functions, \\(m\\), \\(n\\), \\(p\\), and \\(q\\),<em>&nbsp;</em>that describe the amount of money, in dollars, in a bank account as a function of time \\(x\\), in years. If the account is yours (and more money is better), which function would you choose? Why?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Here are equations defining the functions.</p>\n<p>\\(m(x)=200 \\cdot (\\frac{1}{4})^x\\)</p>\n<p>\\(n(x)=200 \\cdot (\\frac{1}{2})^x\\)</p>\n<p>\\(p(x)=200 \\cdot (\\frac{3}{4})^x\\)</p>\n<p>\\(q(x)=200 \\cdot (\\frac{7}{8})^x\\)</p>\n<p>Give students quiet time to think individually and ask students to share their responses. Ask a student who chose the first option and one who chose the last option to share their reasoning. Tell students they will now consider the options graphically before confirming their choice.</p>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Provide access to graphing technology.</p>\n<h5> Support for English Language Learners</h5>\n<div>\n  <p>In groups of 2, students should take turns explaining their reasoning of how they matched the equations to the graphs. Display the following sentence frames for all to see: &ldquo;The equation _____ matches graph _____ because . . .&rdquo; and &ldquo;I noticed _____ , so I matched . . . .&rdquo; Encourage students to challenge each other when they disagree. When monitoring the discussions, point out key words and phrases such as &ldquo;the bases are less than 1,&rdquo; &ldquo;slowly decaying,&rdquo; or &ldquo;more vertical curve.&rdquo; This will help students solidify their understanding of how the &ldquo;b&rdquo; affects the graph.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h5> Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n<div>\n  <p>Differentiate the degree of difficulty by beginning with more accessible values. When presenting the scenario, begin by displaying only \\(m(x)\\) and \\(p(x)\\) for students to consider briefly before revealing the remaining functions. In addition, some students may benefit from revisiting findings from the warm-up, in which after spending \\(\\frac13\\) of the gift money, Jada had \\(\\frac23\\) left.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Match each function with a graph.

Discuss questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>&ldquo;In the first question, what does the point that the graphs share on the \\(y\\)-axis say about the situation?&rdquo; (All of the accounts started with $200.)</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;How does Graph A compare to Graph D?&rdquo; (Graph A appears more horizontal, so the function is decaying at a slower rate.)</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;What does the largest factor (\\(\\frac78\\)) tell us? To which graph does it correspond?&rdquo; (The function loses only \\(\\frac18\\) of its value when \\(x\\) increases by 1, so it is decaying the most slowly. Graph A must be the graph of \\(q(x)=200 \\cdot (\\frac{7}{8})^x\\) since it shows the slowest decay.)</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;What might a graph representing a function \\(v\\) given by \\(v(x)=200 \\cdot (\\frac{99}{100})^x\\) look like?&rdquo; (It would look very close to a horizontal line because nearly all of its value remains as \\(x\\) increases by 1, so it is decaying very slowly.)</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;What might a graph representing a function \\(w\\) given by \\(w(x)=200 \\cdot (\\frac{1}{100})^x\\) look like?&rdquo; (It will go toward 0 extremely quickly because it loses \\(\\frac{99}{100}\\) of its value each time \\(x\\) increases by 1, so it is decaying very quickly.)</li>\n  <li>Emphasize that, in situations characterized by exponential growth (when \\(b&gt;1\\)), a larger value of \\(b\\) means a curve that is more vertical. In situations characterized by exponential decay, where \\(b\\) is between 0 and 1, the closer \\(b\\) is to 1, the more the graph approaches a horizontal line. Conversely, the smaller the value of \\(b\\), the more swiftly it heads toward 0 (the more vertical the curve is) before it flattens out and approaches a horizontal line.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>5.12.3: Self Check</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>\n        <p> Which of the following functions will decay the fastest?</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(f(x)=0.86^x-10\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incorrect.
