It also reinforces the ties between the zeros of a function and the horizontal intercepts of its graph, which students began exploring in an earlier unit.</p>\n<p>Previously, to solve an equation such as \\(-16t^2+8t+10=32\\) by graphing, students would graph \\(y=-16t^2+8t+10\\) and \\(y=32\\) and inspect where the parabolic graph and the horizontal line intersect.</p>\n<p>Here, students learn another way to use graphs to solve equations and to anticipate the number of solutions. Instead of graphing two separate equations&mdash;one quadratic and one linear&mdash;students learn that they can solve by rearranging the equation into the form <em>expression</em> \\(= 0\\), graphing the equation \\(y =\\) <em>expression</em>, and finding the horizontal intercepts. Why does this make sense?</p>\n<p>The \\(x\\)-coordinate of those intercepts produces a \\(y\\)-coordinate of 0, so they are the solutions to the equation <em>expression</em> \\(= 0\\).</p>\n<p>The number of horizontal intercepts tells us the instances when the \\(y\\)-coordinate is 0, which tells us the number of solutions to the equation.</p>\n<p>Later in the lesson, students think about why a quadratic equation that has an expression in factored form on one side of the equal sign but does not have 0 on the other side cannot be solved the same way as when the equation is <em>expression</em>\\(= 0\\). They also notice that dividing each side of a quadratic equation by a variable is not reliable because it eliminates one of the solutions.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Coordinate (orally) graphs with no horizontal intercepts, quadratic functions with no (real) zeros, and quadratic equations with no (real) solutions. </li>\n  <li> Describe (orally and in writing) the relationship between the solutions to quadratic equations of the form <em>expression</em> \\(= 0\\) and the horizontal intercepts of the graph of the related function. </li>\n  <li> Explain (orally and in writing) why dividing each side of a quadratic equation by a variable is not a reliable way to solve the equation. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Explain why dividing by a variable to solve a quadratic equation is not a good strategy. </li>\n  <li> Explain why quadratic equations can have no solutions and explain why there are none. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><u>A8(A) solve quadratic equations having real solutions by</u> factoring, <u>taking square roots</u>, completing the square, and applying the quadratic formula.</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Partial coverage: Lesson provides content that covers part of this TEKS.
