You also extended the pattern of the equation of each. </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 5.5.2: Exponential Decay <ul>\n<li> In this activity, you learned how the value of a used car can be represented using exponential decay. You also learned how to use the values from the problem to write the equation. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span>5.5.</span><span>2: Self Check</span><br></li>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<li> 5.5.3: Using Graphs to Represent Exponential Decay <ul>\n<li> In this activity, you analyzed how an algae bloom shrinks after being treated. The values of the equations were analyzed in the context of the situation, and each of the observations was graphed. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span>5.5.3: Sel</span><span>f Check</span><br></li>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<li> 5.5.4: Justifying Exponential Models <ul>\n<li> In this activity, you analyzed how much insulin is left in a diabetic&rsquo;s bloodstream over time. This scenario was used to justify the fact that the insulin decreases exponentially over time. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span>5.5.4: Self</span><span> Check</span><br></li>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<li> 5.5.5: Writing Equations to Represent Exponential Decay </li>\n<ul>\n<li> In this activity, you used the graph of the breakdown of acetaminophen to create an exponential equation to represent the situation. </li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 5.5.6: Practice </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<!--pulldown-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n<p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<p>Correct!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!--Do not edit below line.-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n</div>"
