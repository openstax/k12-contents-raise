Translating the\n    details of these situations into inequalities is the first step in\n    understanding them. Let&rsquo;s look at how we can translate these situations\n    into mathematical sentences.<br></span><br>\n<p><strong>Example #1</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imani won a mini-grant of $4,000 to buy tablet computers for her classroom.\n    The tablets she would like to buy cost $254.12 each, including tax and\n    delivery. She can only spend up to the amount of the mini-grant.</p>\n<p>Choose a variable to represent the quantity of tablet computers:</p>\n<div>\n<p>Let \\( n \\) = the number of tablets.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Translate: Write a sentence that gives the information provided.</p>\n<div>\n<p>$254.12 times the number of tablets is no more than $4,000.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Translate into an inequality:</p>\n<div>\n<p>\\( 254.12n &lt; 4000 \\)</p>\n</div>\n<p>Imani&rsquo;s situation is represented by the inequality \\(254.12n &lt; 4000\\).</p>\n<p><strong>Example #2&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Taleisha&rsquo;s phone plan costs her $28.80 a month plus $0.20 per text message. Her monthly bill can be no more than $50.</p>\n<p>Choose a variable to represent the quantity of text messages:</p>\n<div>\n<p>Let \\( t \\) = the number of text messages.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Translate: Write a sentence that gives the information provided.</p>\n<div>\n<p>$28.80 plus $0.20 times the number of text messages is less than or equal to $50.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Translate into an inequality:</p>\n<div>\n<p>\\( 28.80 + 0.20t &lt; 50 \\)</p>\n</div>\n<p>Taleisha&rsquo;s situation is represented by the inequality \\( 28.80 + 0.20t &lt; 50 \\).</p>\n<h3>Try It: Translating Situations into Inequalities</h3>\n<p>Read each problem below and write an inequality to represent the situation.</p><br>\n<!--Text Entry Interaction Start -->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"eventShow\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-content\">\n<p></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Angie has at most $20 to spend on juice boxes for her son&rsquo;s preschool picnic.
