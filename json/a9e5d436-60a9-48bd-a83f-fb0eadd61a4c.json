In this lesson, students use graphs to learn about the domain and range of functions, while continuing to think about what values are reasonable in the given situations.</p>\n<p>Students learn to look for graphical features that would help them identify restrictions to the input or output. For example, they recognize that maximums and minimums, intercepts, and gaps on the graph can be quite informative. They also see that discrete points or breaks in a graph suggest that not all values can be in the domain or range, and that a graph may only partially represent a function. The work here offers opportunities to look for and make use of structure.</p>\n<p>As they examine graphs against situations and vice versa, students practice making sense of quantities and reasoning concretely and abstractly. When describing domain and range, students also practice attending to precision by minding relevant details in the graphs and descriptions of functions.</p>\n<p>In upcoming lessons, students will learn about piecewise functions and absolute value functions. The work here prepares them to make sense of the quantities in those functions, where the dependent variable behaves differently for different parts of the domain.</p>\n<p>Advanced preparation, which includes data collection and organization, is needed for an upcoming lesson on absolute value functions. See Required Preparation for Absolute Value Functions (Part 1).</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Given a description of a function that represents a situation, determine reasonable domain and range. </li>\n<li> Practice interpreting key features of graphs in terms of the quantities represented. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Determine a reasonable domain and range for the function when given a description of a function in a situation. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<colgroup>\n<col>\n<col>\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>A2(A) determine the domain and range of a linear function in mathematical problems; determine reasonable domain and range values for real-world situations, both continuous and discrete; and represent domain and range using inequalities;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</span><br>\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 4.12.1: Different Features of a Graph </li>\n<li> 4.12.2: Graphs of Functions </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 4.12.2: Self Check </li>\n<li> 4.12.2: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 4.12.3: Finding Domain and Range Using a Graph </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 4.12.3: Self Check </li>\n<li> 4.12.3: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 4.12.4: Real-World Domain and Range </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 4.12.4: Self Check </li>\n<li> 4.12.4: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 4.12.5: Graph of a Function and the Domain and Range Connection </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 4.12.6: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/572557fb9ba435a95a66d99e4e8cbd8ca84bd562\" target=\"_blank\">4.12 Graph Handout</a></p>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<p>Copy graph handout for each student.</p>\n<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson.
