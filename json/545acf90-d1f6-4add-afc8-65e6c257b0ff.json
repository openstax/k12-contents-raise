They will identify vertical shifts, vertical stretches and compressions, and vertical rotations.</p>\n<p>Through exploration with graphing, students will recognize patterns for the transformations and understand how the constants in the slope-intercept form determine the transformations needed to graph the function.</p>\n<p>Students will also be able to describe how one function transforms from the parent function, f(x)=x and how one function transforms to another.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Use slope-intercept form and transformations to graph linear functions. </li>\n  <li> Recognize the shifts made to a parent linear function to form another linear function. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4> Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li> Use slope-intercept form and transformations to graph linear functions. </li>\n  <li> Recognize the shifts made to a parent linear function to form another linear function. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4> Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKs)</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(A3(E)\\) determine the effects on the graph of the parent function \\(f(x) = x\\) when \\(f(x)\\) is replaced by \\(af(x)\\), \\(f(x) + d\\), \\(f(x - c)\\), \\(f(bx)\\) for specific values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\);</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 4.10.1: Graphing Linear Functions </li>\n  <li> 4.10.2: Vertical Shifts </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> Self-Check </li>\n    <li> Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 4.10.3: Vertical Stretches and Compressions </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> Self-Check </li>\n    <li> Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 4.10.4: Graphing Using Transformations </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 4.10.5: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li> coordinate grids </li>\n  <li> rulers </li>\n  <li> colored pencils </li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n  <p> Optional materials:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n  <li>geoboards </li>\n  <li> rubber bands of different colors </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<p>None</p>\n<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson.
