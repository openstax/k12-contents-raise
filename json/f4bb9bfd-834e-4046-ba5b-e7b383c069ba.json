The equation for the function also shows that \\(b=-3\\), so the identity function is vertically shifted down 3 units. First, graph the identity function, and show the vertical compression as in Figure 16.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"This graph shows two functions on an x, y coordinate plane.

When the function is evaluated at a given input, the corresponding output is calculated by following the order of operations. So, the stretch was performed before the vertical shift.</p>\n<h4>Try It: Transformations of Linear Functions</h4>\n<br>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"Reveal1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-content\">\n    <p>Name the transformations to go from the parent function, \\(f(x)=x\\), to \\(f(x)=4+2x\\).</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-prompt\">\n    <p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to check your work. </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-content\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\" data-wait-for-event=\"Reveal1\">\n  <p>Here is how to determine the transformations:</p>\n  <p>First, the slope \\(m=2\\) tells that there is a vertical stretch of 2.</p>\n  <p>Next, the \\(y\\)-intercept is 4, so there is a vertical shift up 4.</p>\n</div>"
