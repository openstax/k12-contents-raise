You thought about whether there would be a strong correlation or not as well as whether the relationship was a positive or negative correlation. </span></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><span lang=\"EN\">3.5.2: Finding and Using Correlation Coefficient to Interpret the Strength of Linear Relationships</span>\n    <ul>\n      <li><span lang=\"EN\">In this activity, you used technology to find a correlation coefficient given data and used it to interpret the strength of the linear relationship in context. In addition, you interpreted the coefficients of the equation of the line of best fit and used the equation to make predictions.</span></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><span lang=\"EN\">3.5.2: Self-Check</span></li>\n  <li><span lang=\"EN\">3.5.3: Using Correlation Coefficient to Describe Relationships between Two Variables</span>\n    <ul>\n      <li><span lang=\"EN\">In this activity, you used the correlation coefficient to describe the relationship between two variables. You examined a pair of variables and a correlation coefficient to describe the relationship between the variables as strong or weak and as positive or negative.</span></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><span lang=\"EN\">3.5.3: Self-Check</span></li>\n  <li><span lang=\"EN\">3.5.4: Interpreting the Correlation Coefficient</span>\n    <ul>\n      <li><span lang=\"EN\"><span lang=\"EN\">In this activity,\n            you described what the sign and numerical value of the correlation\n            coefficient tell you about the strength of the linear relationship.</span></span><span lang=\"EN\"><br></span></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">After\n    these activities, you completed the following <b>practice</b></span><span lang=\"EN\">:</span></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><span lang=\"EN\">3.5.5:\n      Practice</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><br></h4>\n<h4>Checking In&nbsp;</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <!--Q1-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n      <p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n      <p>Correct!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n      <p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!----------------- Must be included at the bottom of page for dropdown to work ------------>\n  <!--Do not edit below line.-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n</div>"
