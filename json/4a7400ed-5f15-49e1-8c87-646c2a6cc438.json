While rate of change has an unambiguous meaning for linear functions, for nonlinear functions rates of change are not constant, so an interval must be specified.</p>\n<p>In this lesson, students are first invited to recall how to calculate an average rate of change for a specific interval for a function represented by a data table. Students then consider the average rate of change for an exponential function describing the increase in the number of coffee shops for a business. By comparing the average rate of change of different intervals that all start at the same point, students can observe that while the average rate of change can describe how the data are changing with reasonable accuracy over some intervals, it is not a good predictor over larger intervals since exponential functions do not have a constant rate of change. In the last activity, students use the average rate of change to describe how the cost of producing 1 watt from a solar cell decreases in two separate intervals, which illuminates the nature of exponential decay to decrease at a slower rate. Contexts are used throughout this lesson to give students an opportunity to reason abstractly and quantitatively.</p>\n<p>In future lessons, students will analyze multiple exponential functions at the same time and will be able to use the average rate of change to make comparisons among the functions over the same intervals.</p>\n<h4> Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li> Calculate the average rate of change of a function over a specified interval. </li>\n<li> Explain (in writing) how well given rates of change reflect the changes in an exponential function. </li>\n<li> Understand that an exponential function, unlike a linear function, has different average rate of change values for different intervals. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li> Calculate the average rate of change of a function over a specified period of time. </li>\n<li> Recognize how the average rate of change of an exponential function differs from that of a linear function. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<colgroup>\n<col>\n<col>\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>A3(B) calculate the rate of change of a linear function represented tabularly, graphically, or algebraically in context of mathematical and real-world problems;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4> Lesson Activities</h4>\n<ul>\n<li> 5.10.1: Calculate an Average Rate of Change from Two Points </li>\n<li> 5.10.2: Explore Average Rates of Change in an Exponential Growth Function <ul>\n<li> 5.10.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>5.10.2: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> 5.10.3: Explore Average Rates of Change in an Exponential Decay Context <ul>\n<li> 5.10.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>5.10.3: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> 5.10.4: Average Rate of Change </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 5.10.5: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<ul>\n<li> None&nbsp; </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li> None </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson.
