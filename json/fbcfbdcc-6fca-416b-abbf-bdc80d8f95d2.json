You did this by making sense of the provided graphs and used them to answer questions in the context of the scenario. You recalled that a quantity that grows by adding the same amount at each step forms a line when plotted. Also, after viewing an example, you learned that a quantity that grows by the same ratio or factor at each step forms a curve when plotted. </li>\n</ul>\n<li><span>5.3.3: Self Check</span><br></li>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<li> 5.3.4: Match Expressions and Tables with Situations </li>\n<ul>\n<li> In this activity, you studied two stories characterized by different growth patterns and then matched expressions and tables with the two situations. </li>\n</ul>\n<li><span>5.3.4: Self Check</span><br></li>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<li> 5.3.5: Describe Mathematically Changes in Growth </li>\n<ul>\n<li> In this activity, you described mathematically, as precisely as you could, how a population changed over time. </li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following<strong> practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 5.3.6: Practice </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<!--pulldown-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n<p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<p>Correct!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!--Do not edit below line.-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n</div>"
