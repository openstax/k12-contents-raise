The method we\n  will use to solve applications with linear inequalities is very much\n  like the one we used when we solved applications with equations.</p>\n<p>We\n  will read the problem and make sure we understand all the words. Next,\n  we will identify what we are looking for and assign a variable to\n  represent it. We will restate the problem in one sentence to make it\n  easy to translate into an inequality.&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Example&nbsp;</strong><br>\n</p>\n<p>Dawn\n  won a mini-grant of $4,000 to buy tablet computers for her classroom.\n  The tablets she would like to buy cost $254.12 each, including tax and\n  delivery.
