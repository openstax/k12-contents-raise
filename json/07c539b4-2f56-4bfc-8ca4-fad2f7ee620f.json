Highlight the method of dividing any term by the previous term to find the common ratio. Emphasize that the presence of a common ratio is what makes a sequence a geometric sequence.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<h5> Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n<div>\n<p>Provide access to tools and assistive technologies, such as a calculator or graphing software.

Said another way, the common ratio is the quotient of a term and the previous term. For example, many students will want to say that the pattern of the third sequence is &ldquo;divide by 10 each time.&rdquo; This is true, but the common ratio is \\(\\frac1{10}\\).</p>\n<h3>4.14.3: Self Check</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<colgroup>\n<col>\n<col>\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>\n<p>Which of the following sequences is geometric?</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>5, 10, 15, 20 . . .</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Incorrect.

This constant is called the common ratio of the sequence. The common ratio can be found by dividing any term in the sequence by the previous term. If \\(a_1\\) is the initial term of a geometric sequence and \\(r\\) is the common ratio, the sequence will be</p>\n<p>{\\(a_1, a_1\\cdot r, a_1\\cdot r^2, a_1\\cdot r^3\\), . . .}</p>\n<p>How to:</p>\n<p>Given a set of numbers, determine if they represent a geometric sequence.</p>\n<p>1. Divide each term by the previous term.</p>\n<p>2. Compare the quotients. If they are the same, a common ratio exists and the sequence is geometric.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>Is the sequence geometric? If so, find the common ratio.</p>\n<p>a. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, . . .</p>\n<p>b. 48, 12, 4, 2, . . .</p>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>\n    Is a geometric sequence. Each term is multiplied by 2, so 2 is the common ratio.\n  </li>\n<li>\n    This is not geometric because each term is not multiplied by the same constant. There is not a common ratio.\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Try It: Finding a Common Ratio</h4>\n<p>Is the sequence geometric? If so, find the common ratio.</p>\n<p>100, 20, 4, \\(\\frac45\\), . . .</p>\n<p>In your notebook, write down your answer. Then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to check your work.</p>\n<h5>Solution</h5>\n<p>Here is how to determine if the sequence is geometric:</p>\n<p>Each term is \\(\\frac15\\) of the previous term. So, the common ratio is \\(\\frac15\\), and this is a geometric sequence.</p>\n<p>How did you do? Know that you learn more from wrong answers than from right answers!
