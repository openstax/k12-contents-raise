At this point, the\n  mathematics of scatter plot analysis cannot determine whether there is a\n  causal relationship. The relationship must be thought through carefully\n  to decide, based on the situation, whether the related variables have a\n  causal relationship. As students analyze the relationships, they are\n  modeling with mathematics (TEKS 1A and 1F).</p>\n<h4>Launch\n</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 2.\n  Tell students there are many possible answers for the questions. After\n  quiet work time, ask students to compare their responses to their\n  partner&rsquo;s and decide if they are both correct, even if they are\n  different. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>\n<h4>Support for Students with Disabilities</h4>\n<div>\n<p> <em>Representation: Develop Language and Symbols.</em>\n    Create a display of important terms and vocabulary. After the first\n    question, invite students to suggest language or diagrams to include that\n    will support their understanding of causal relationships. Examples to\n    include can be phrases such as, &ldquo;increased rain causes people to wear\n    jackets.&rdquo; The two variables can be color-coded in two different colors\n    to reveal the relationship. Both the axes and the labels can be\n    highlighted with the color that connects it to the type of variable it\n    addresses.</p>\n<p><em>Supports accessibility for: Conceptual processing; Language</em> </p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>\n<div>\n<p>Each of the scatter plots shows a\n    strong relationship. Write a sentence or two describing how you think\n    the variables are related.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>During the month of April, Elena keeps track of the number of inches\n      of rain, or precipitation, recorded for the day and the percentage of people who come to\n      school with rain jackets.<br><br><img alt=\"A scatterplot.

For each pair of variables, ask students what\n    might have <em>caused</em> the variables to be linked. In some cases\n    (the first two here), one of the variables causes a change in the other.\n    In other cases (the last two here), an additional variable or situation\n    is the cause of the change.</p>\n<p>Tell students that since most people are used to seeing independent variables on the \\( x \\)-axis and dependent variables on the \\( y \\)-axis, the convention is to put the causal variable on the \\( x \\)-axis and the other variable on the \\( y \\)-axis\n    when one of the variables does cause the other to change. The book club\n    scatter plot should probably have the axes switched to meet the\n    convention.</p>\n<p>Here are some questions for discussion.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&ldquo;Why does an increase in precipitation cause an increase in the\n      percentage of people wearing rain jackets?&rdquo; (When it rains, people\n      usually wear coats to stay dry.)</li>\n<li>&ldquo;An increase in the time it takes to read a book does not cause the\n      number of pages in the book to increase. Does an increase in the number\n      of pages in a book cause the time it takes to read a book to increase?\n      Explain your reasoning.&rdquo; (Yes, if you switch the axes on the graph, you\n      can see that relationship. It is causal because it takes longer to read\n      more pages.)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>\n<h4>3.6.2 Self Check</h4>\n<p><em><strong>After</strong><strong>\n        the activity, students will answer the following question to check\n        their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</strong></em></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\">\n<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ad86a65e-7fff-60eb-2ffa-b20b5dd93eca\">In this scatter plot, which sentence best describes how the two variables are related?</span></p>\n<p><strong> <img alt=\"SCATTER PLOT THAT CAN BE APPROXIMATED BY A LINE, WHERE THE Y-VALUES INCREASE AS THE X-VALUES INCREASE\" class=\"img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom\" height=\"327\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/55125f5d50ad21b6e3730165d7cb0b1e9fdf56ca\" width=\"350\"> </strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"A\">\n<li><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-4f84ccf4-7fff-3a97-c59e-b093c52d9285\">The more hot dogs that are bought, the more sodas that are bought. </span></li>\n</ol>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-a53dd2b0-7fff-dc83-b43f-557daa0a4ec7\">Incorrect.
