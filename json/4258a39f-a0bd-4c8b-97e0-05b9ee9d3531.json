Consider asking students to use sentence starters such as these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I would choose to solve system <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( \\underline{\\hspace{0.5in}} \\)</span> by substitution because . . .</li>\n<li>I would <em>not</em> choose to solve system <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( \\underline{\\hspace{0.5in}} \\)</span> by substitution because . . <br></li>\n</ul>\n<p>With a little bit of rearrangement, all systems could be solved by substitution without cumbersome computation, but system 2 would be most conducive to solving by substitution.</p>\n<p>Consider collecting students&rsquo; responses or asking them to share their written arguments with a partner. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n"
