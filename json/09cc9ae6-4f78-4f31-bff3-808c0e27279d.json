(For example, \\(6^2 \\)and \\((-6)^2\\) both equal 36, so 6 and -6 are both square roots of 36.) </li>\n<li> The square root symbol \\((\\sqrt{\\;\\;})\\) can be used to express the positive square root of a number. For example, the square root of 36 is 6, but it can also be written as \\(\\sqrt{36}\\) because \\(\\sqrt{36} \\cdot \\sqrt{36}=36\\). </li>\n<li> To express the negative square root of a number, say 36, we can write -6 or \\(-\\sqrt{36}\\). </li>\n<li> When a number is not a perfect square (for example, 40), we can express its square roots by writing \\(\\sqrt{40}\\) and \\(-\\sqrt{40}\\). </li>\n</ul>\n<p>How could we write the solutions to an equation like \\((x+4)^2=11\\)? This equation is saying, &ldquo;something squared is 11.&rdquo; To make the equation true, that something must be \\(\\sqrt{11}\\) or \\(-\\sqrt{11}\\).</p>\n<p>We can write:</p>\n<p>\\(x+4= \\sqrt{11}\\) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\tor &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t\\(x+4= - \\sqrt{11}\\)</p>\n<p>\\(x=-4+ \\sqrt{11}\\) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\tor &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \\(x=-4+- \\sqrt{11}\\) </p>\n<p>A more compact way to write the two solutions to the equation is: \\(x=-4 \\pm \\sqrt{11}\\).</p>\n<h4>Try It: Solving Quadratics with Radical Solutions</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"Reveal1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-content\">\n<p>Solve \\((x-2)^2=17\\).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-prompt\">\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-content\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\" data-wait-for-event=\"Reveal1\">\n<p>Here is how to solve this quadratic equation:</p>\n<p>Step 1<br>\n    Make sure the quadratic is isolated on one side.<br>\n    \\((x-2)^2=17\\)</p>\n<p>Step 2<br>\n    Take the square root of both sides.<br>\n    \\(\\sqrt{(x-2)^2}= \\pm \\sqrt{17}\\)</p>\n<p>Step 3<br>\n    Simplify.<br>\n    \\(x-2= \\pm \\sqrt{17}\\)</p>\n<p>Step 4<br>\n    Solve the equation.
