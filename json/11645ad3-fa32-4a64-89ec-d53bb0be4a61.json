Enter the scatter plot that matches the scenario in row 1 here. Explain why you think the scatter plot depicts this set of variables?</span></p>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-ack\">\n\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The answer is C because there is little to no correlation or relationship between the daily low temperature in Denver, CO and the amount of cereal stocked in Miami, FL. The scatterplot in graph C most closely depicts a relationship that is not correlated since the points do not cluster along a line or curve. </span></p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<!--Question 2 -->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-content\">\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-prompt\">\n\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">2. Enter the scatter plot that matches the scenario in row 2 here. Explain why you think the scatter plot depicts this set of variables?</span></p>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-ack\">\n\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The answer is B because a positive correlation exists. That is, when the number of attempted free throws increases, then the team score will increase. While this is a strong likelihood, there are other factors that impact the score such as the number of free throws actually scored, the number of three-point shots scored, the number of two-point shots scored, etc. These other possible factors introduce variablity among the points and with the line of best fit.\n      </span></p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<!--Question 3 -->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-content\">\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-prompt\">\n\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">3. Enter the scatter plot that matches the scenario in row 3 here. Explain why you think the scatter plot depicts this set of variables?</span></p>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-ack\">\n\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The answer is A because as a person&rsquo;s height measured in inches increases, the height measured in feet also increases and results in a positive correlation. Since the conversion factor from inches to feet does not vary, the scatterplot tightly clusters on the line of best fit.\n      </span></p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<!--Question 4 -->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-content\">\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-prompt\">\n\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">4. Enter the scatter plot that matches the scenario in row 4 here. Explain why you think the scatter plot depicts this set of variables?</span></p>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-ack\">\n\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The answer is D because there is a negative correlation between the two variables. That is, tthe longer someone waits in a waiting room, the lower the satisfaction rating for the hospital that could be reported. However, this negative correlation is not tightly clustered along a line of best fit because there are other factors that will impact the satisfaction rating such as staff friendliness, cleanliness of the facility, doctors bedside manner, etc.</span></p>\n\n</div>\n</div>"
