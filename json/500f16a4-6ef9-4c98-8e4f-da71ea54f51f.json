This is a convention, one that allows the rule \\(b^x\\cdot b^y=b^{\\left(x+y\\right)}\\) to remain true when \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) is allowed to be 0. An additional convention, which is not addressed in this task, states that \\(b^{-n}=\\frac1{b^n}\\) for a whole number \\(n\\). With these conventions, the equation \\(b^x\\cdot b^y=b^{x+y}\\) is true for all integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<br>\n<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n<div>\n  <p>Activate or supply background knowledge about exponents.

The grouping with parentheses does not affect the value of the expression.</p>\n<ol>\n  <li> Is this true for exponents? That is, are the numbers \\(2^{\\left(3^5\\right)}\\) and \\(\\left(2^3\\right)^5\\) equal? If not, which is bigger? <br><br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> The two numbers are not even close! Since \\(3^5=243\\), the number \\(2^{\\left(3^5\\right)}\\) is \\(2^{243}\\). On the other hand, \\(\\left(2^3\\right)^5=2^3\\cdot2^3\\cdot2^3\\cdot2^3\\cdot2^3=2^{15}\\). The number \\(2^{243}\\) is much larger than \\(2^{15}\\).\n  </li>\n  <br>\n  <li> Which of the two would you choose as the meaning of the expression \\(2^{3^5}\\) written without parentheses? <br><br>\n    <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Typically, we define repeated exponents by working down the tower, e.g., \\(2^{3^5}=2^{\\left(3^5\\right)}\\). One reason for this is that evaluating up the tower, as in \\(\\left(2^3\\right)^5\\), can already be simplified by using algebra rules (in this case, to get \\(2^{15}\\)).\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>\n<p>Students may think that \\(a^0=0\\). First, remind them that exponents are not the same as multiplication (for example, \\(4^3=4\\cdot4\\cdot 4\\), and \\(4\\cdot 4\\cdot 4\\) is very different from \\(4\\cdot3\\)). Next, ask them to use the patterns that they notice in the equations and tables to determine the correct value.</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Make sure students understand that \\(5^0=1\\) is an agreed-upon definition. The reason for defining \\(5^0\\) this way is so that the property \\(\\left(5^a\\cdot5^b=5^{a+b}\\right)\\) continues to hold when we allow 0 as an exponent.</p>\n<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>\n<div>\n  <p>Before students share their explanations for the last question, present an incorrect answer and explanation. For example, &ldquo;5 to the power of 0 is 0, because I multiplied to get it.&rdquo; Ask students to identify the error, critique the reasoning, and write a correct explanation. As students discuss with a partner, listen for students who identify and clarify the ambiguous language in the statement. Invite students to share their critiques and corrected explanations with the class. Listen for and amplify the language students use to describe what happens when a number is raised to the power of 0 and highlight those who use patterns in the table. This helps students evaluate, and improve on, the written mathematical arguments of others as they clarify their understanding of the power of 0.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>5.4.2: Self Check</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong> </p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION</strong><strong>:</strong></p>\n        <p>Santos and Sara are checking their work on the following problem: \\(4\\left(2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\right)^0\\).</p>\n        <p>Santos says the answer is 1.
