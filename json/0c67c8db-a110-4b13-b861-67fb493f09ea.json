Students began this work earlier in the course. They applied the distributive property to expand an expression such as \\((x + 5)(x + 4)\\) into standard form, using rectangular diagrams to help organize and keep track of the partial products. Here, the focus is on using the structure to go in reverse: rewriting into factored form an expression given in standard form.</p>\n<p>The expressions students encounter here are two sums or two differences, in the form of \\((x + m)(x + n)\\) or \\((x &minus; m)(x &minus; n)\\). When working with two differences, it is helpful to think of subtracting \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) as adding \\(-m\\) and \\(-n\\) and labeling the diagrams accordingly. For example, for the last expression, \\((x &minus; 1)(x &minus; 7)\\), one side of the diagram should be labeled with \\(x\\) and &ndash;1, and the other side should be labeled with \\(x\\) and &ndash;7.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<br>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"51\">\n    <col width=\"55\">\n    <col width=\"53\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>&nbsp;</td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>2</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x^2\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(2x\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>3</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(3x\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>6</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p>Display this diagram for all to see, and remind students that they have seen diagrams such as this one in a previous unit on quadratic functions.</p>\n<p>Ask students what expression it represents (both \\((x + 2)(x + 3)\\) and \\(x^2+ 5x + 6\\)).</p>\n<p>Next, ask students what this diagram represents.</p>\n<br>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"51\">\n    <col width=\"55\">\n    <col width=\"53\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>&nbsp;</td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>&ndash;6</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>&nbsp;</td>\n      <td>&nbsp;</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>&ndash;2</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>&nbsp;</td>\n      <td>&nbsp;</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p>Students might say \\((x + (-6))(x + (-2))\\) or \\((x &minus; 6)(x &minus; 2)\\).
