If students mention that some quantities are known or are fixed and others are not, ask them to specify which ones are which.</p>\n        <p>Highlight the idea that sometimes we know how quantities are related, but the value of each quantity may be unknown or may change. We often use letters to represent those unknown or changing quantities. </p>\n        <p>There might be times, however, when we use letters to represent quantities that are known or are constant. Doing so may help us focus on the relationship rather than the numbers. Tell students we will look at examples of such situations in upcoming activities.</p>\n        <p></p>\n        <h2>1.2.3: Self Check&nbsp;<br></h2>\n        <div class=\"body\"><strong><em>Following the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></div>\n        <p><strong></strong></p>\n        <div align=\"left\" dir=\"ltr\">\n          <table>\n            <colgroup>\n              <col>\n              <col>\n            </colgroup>\n            <tbody>\n              <tr>\n                <td colspan=\"2\">\n                  <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>QUESTION:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n                  <p dir=\"ltr\">Max and Jules are renting a car for their 3-day trip.
