Diego writes an equation for the nth term of the sequence as \\(a_n=-3+(n-1)(0.5)\\). Is he correct? Explain how you know.\n    </li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n        How would you describe the representation \\(f_1=-3\\), \\(f_n=f_{n-1}+0.5\\) for \\(n\\geq2\\) for Diego&rsquo;s sequence?\n    </li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n        How would you describe the representation of Diego&rsquo;s sequence, \\(a_n=-3+(n-1)(0.5)\\)?\n    </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Yes. Sample response: Both definitions create a sequence that starts at &ndash;3 and increases by 0.5 each term.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It is the recursive definition of the sequence.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This is the nth term of the sequence.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>More Chances</h5>\n<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>"
