They practiced identifying and writing equivalent equations by performing some acceptable moves. Students also recognized that, when solving one-variable equations, they are essentially writing a series of equivalent equations that lead to the solution.</p>\n        <p>This lesson serves two main goals. The first goal is to further develop the idea of equivalent equations. Students think about and articulate how they know that the equations produced using acceptable moves are indeed equivalent. The process is an opportunity to practice constructing logical arguments and critiquing the reasoning of others.</p>\n        <p>The second goal is to refamiliarize students with equations with no solutions (which they encountered in grade 8) and with a move that might appear acceptable (dividing each side of an equation by the same variable expression) but would, in fact, lead us to the wrong conclusion.</p>\n      </div>\n      <h3>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h3>\n      <p>Students will be able to:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Explain (orally and in writing) why performing certain operations on an equation may create equivalent equations but performing other operations may not.</li>\n        <li>Illustrate that dividing by a variable is not used in solving equations because it can lead to equations that have fewer solutions than the original equation.</li>\n        <li>Demonstrate that equations that are not true for any value of the variable(s) do not have solutions.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <div class=\"body\">\n      </div>\n      <h3>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Explain why some algebraic moves create equivalent equations but some do not.</li>\n        <li>Describe how equivalent equations are related to the steps of solving equations.</li>\n        <li>Explain what it means for an equation to have no solutions and recognize such an equation.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h3>\n      <div><br>\n        <table border=\"1\" padding=\"5px\">\n          <thead>\n            <tr>\n              <th scope=\"col\">TEKS</th>\n              <th scope=\"col\">Explanation of Coverage<br></th>\n            </tr>\n          </thead>\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-c6ad2298-7fff-7c68-7c67-80a062378cf5\">A5(A) solve linear equations in one variable, including those for which the application of the distributive property is necessary and for which variables are included on both sides;</span></td>\n              <td><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-01b80ecc-7fff-0dd0-fb80-8ac498393898\">Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</span></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-46a1c056-7fff-ac68-499b-b41a3e4c6cc3\">A12(E) solve mathematic and scientific formulas, and other literal equations, for a specified variable.</span></td>\n              <td><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-781d60a3-7fff-2bca-fab3-333b602190c4\">Foundational: Lesson provides foundational content necessary for students to be able to perform this TEKS in later lessons.</span></td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-84734dc5-7fff-b960-e4bd-7f215ffc9cf2\">A5(C) solve systems of two linear equations with two variables for mathematical and real-world problems.</span></td>\n              <td><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-959d4065-7fff-4454-5cce-cbe8a9fba191\">Foundational: Lesson provides foundational content necessary for students to be able to perform this TEKS in later lessons.</span></td>\n            </tr>\n          </tbody>\n        </table>\n        <br>\n        <h3>Lesson Activities</h3>\n        <p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>1.7.1: Determining if Zero Is a Solution <br></li>\n          <li>1.7.2: Explaining Acceptable Moves Used to Solve an Equation <br>\n            <ul>\n              <li>1.7.2: Self Check <br></li>\n              <li>1.7.2: Additional Resources</li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n          <li>1.7.3: Understanding Equations with No Solution or Infinitely Many<ul>\n              <li>1.7.3: Self Check <br></li>\n              <li>1.7.3: Additional Resources</li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n          <li>1.7.4: Solving Equations by Dividing Values</li>\n        </ul>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 1.7.5: Practice.<br><br>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"body\">\n        <h3>Required Materials</h3>\n        <ul>\n          <li>N/A</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h3>Required Preparation</h3>\n        <p>N/A</p>\n        <div>\n          <h3>Lesson Vocabulary</h3>\n          <div>\n            <p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n            <ul>\n              <li>Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson.
