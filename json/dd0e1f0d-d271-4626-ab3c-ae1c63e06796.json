They encounter a graph where as one quantity increases, a second quantity increases and then decreases. Making sense of the graph in context helps them see why it is reasonable to expect the second quantity to decrease after a certain point.</p>\n<p>As students work, look for those whose graphs include enough points to hint at a quadratic shape. Also, monitor for those who can articulate why \\((1, 25)\\) cannot represent the length and area of the garden. Invite them to share their work later.</p>\n<p>Making graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Keep a table from the previous activity displayed. Students will have the example table from the previous activity in their lesson for use if needed. If students created their own table, encourage them to use the values in their table.</p>\n<p>If students used a spreadsheet tool to organize the lengths and areas for the earlier activity, they may choose to use graphing technology to plot the data.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<ol>\n  <li>Use the graphing tool or technology outside the course. Plot some values for the length and area of the garden with perimeter 50 meters on the coordinate plane.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Use your table, or here is a sample table of values if you need one:</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>Values for a Rectangular Garden with a Perimeter of 50 Meters</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p><strong>Length (meters)</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p><strong>Area (square meters)</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>5</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>100</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>10</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>150</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>12</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>156</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>12.5</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>156.25</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>18</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>126</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>20</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>100</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>24</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>24</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p>Be sure to label your axes.

Length of garden, meters.\" height=\"253\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/d6240fc9cc8507dec19052f10fc6e0b54a938eca\" width=\"326\"></p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n  <li>What do you notice about how the plotted points increase and decrease?<br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;At first, the area grows as the length increases, but then it decreases. Also, the area increases more and more slowly as the length increases.\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\">\n  <li>The points \\((3, 66)\\) and \\((22, 66)\\) each represent the length and area of the garden. Plot these two points on a coordinate plane, if you haven&rsquo;t already done so. What do these points mean in this situation?<br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> The point \\((3, 66)\\) means that if the length of the garden is 3 meters, then the area is 66 square meters. This is right because the width is 22 meters and \\(3 \\cdot 22=66\\). The point \\((22, 66)\\) means that the length of the garden is 22 meters, so its width is 3 meters, and the area is again 66 square meters.\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"4\">\n  <li>Could the point \\((1, 25)\\) represent the length and area of the garden?<br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> The point \\((1, 25)\\) cannot represent the length and area of the garden. If the length of the garden is 1 meter, the width would be 24 meters, so the area is 24 square meters, not 25 square meters.\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Video: The Meaning of Points on a Graph</h4>\n<p>Watch the following video to learn more about the meaning of points on a graph.</p>\n<video controls=\"true\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" width=\"550\">\n  <source src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4855a37f7605c512fcb9fc25f46c9a7c16b17fdd\">\n  <track default=\"true\" kind=\"captions\" label=\"On\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/9735f40fe4a34068b6cd34f459c58c56965c8b5a\" srclang=\"en_us\">https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4855a37f7605c512fcb9fc25f46c9a7c16b17fdd\n</video>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h4>Student-Facing Extension</h4>\n<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>\n<ol>\n  <li>What happens to the area when you interchange the length and width? For example, compare the areas of a rectangle of length 11 meters and width 14 meters with a rectangle of length 14 meters and width 11 meters.<br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> The area stays the same if the length and width are interchanged because the area is the product of the length and the width.\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n  <li>What patterns would you notice if you were to plot more length and area pairs on the graph?<br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> Many of the areas would come with two different pairs: for example, 100 comes from the pair \\((5, 100)\\) and also from the pair \\((20, 100)\\) because a rectangle with length 5 meters and width 20 meters is the same as a rectangle with length 20 meters and width 5 meters. Using a different length and corresponding width, the 156 comes from the pair \\((12, 156)\\) and also from the pair \\((13, 156)\\). The points on the graph would have reflectional symmetry about the line \\(x=12.5\\).\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Select a student to present their graph or display a graph with some points already plotted and amend it with additional points students provide. Discuss with students:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>&ldquo;Is the graph linear? Is it exponential?&rdquo; (It is neither.) </li>\n  <li>&ldquo;If we plot a bunch more points&mdash;say for every whole-number length between 0 and 25&mdash;what do you think the graph would look like?&rdquo; (Possible predictions: A stretched out upside-down U, or an arch. A line with a positive slope that then turns into one with a negative slope. A curve. Some students might even recall the term <em>parabola</em>.) </li>\n  <li>&ldquo;How can we tell whether \\((1, 25)\\) represents the length and area of the garden?&rdquo; (By multiplying 1 and 24 (if the length is 1, the width is 24) to see if it gives 25. Because 1 times 24 is 24, \\((1, 25)\\) does not represent the length and area.) </li>\n  <li>&ldquo;Can we tell if a point represents the length and area of the garden simply by plotting it on the graph? For example, does \\((1.5, 200)\\) represent the length and area? What about \\((23, 60)\\)?&rdquo; (It depends. If a point is far away from other points (for example, \\((1.5, 200)\\)), we can probably tell it does not. If it seems to belong with the general trend of the other points, we may need to check if the input times the width equals the output value.) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tell students that this unit will focus on functions like the one relating the length and area of the garden. The output of the functions may both increase and decrease, so we know they are neither linear nor exponential, but they also don&rsquo;t change in a random way.</p>\n<h3>7.1.3: Self Check</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>\n        <p>The graph below shows a rectangle&rsquo;s side length and its area.
