Each given situation involves an initial value and a\n    constant rate of change.</p>\n<p>Before students begin the activity, introduce them to\n    the graphing technology available in the classroom. Offer a quick\n    tutorial on how to graph equations, adjust the graphing window, and plot\n    points. This tutorial could happen independently of the activity as\n    long as it precedes the activity.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Launch</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Give all students access to graphing technology. Tell\n    students that in this course they will frequently use technology to\n    create a graph that represents an equation and use the graph to solve\n    problems.</p>\n<p>Demonstrate how to use the technology available in your\n    classroom to create and view graphs of equations. Explain how to enter\n    equations, adjust the graphing window, and plot a point. If using\n    Desmos, please see the digital version of this activity for suggested\n    instructions.</p>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 2&ndash;4. Assign one\n    situation to each group. Ask students to answer the first few questions,\n    including writing an equation, and then graph the equation and answer\n    the last question.</p><br>\n<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n<div>\n<p><em>Representation: Access for Perception.</em>\n      Provide students with a physical copy of written directions for using\n      graphing technology and read them aloud.
