Circulate to ensure students are graphing their lines properly. If necessary, partner students during the graphing process.</p>\n<p>In pairs, students should discuss the vertical shifts to the parent function, \\(f(x)=x\\), to graph the new functions.</p>\n<h4> Launch</h4>\n<p>Allow students to work in pairs to check each other&rsquo;s graphs and discuss the relationships to answer the questions. During class discussion, solicit a pair for each question to describe the effects the different slopes have on the graphs.</p>\n<p>For students who can benefit from a more accessible model, use geoboards and rubber bands. Use one color rubber band for the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-axes. Use a different color for each line graphed. Work with students to count spots on the geoboard and discuss the graphs and their relationships.</p>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement </h4>\n<br>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-desmos-gc\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\"></div>\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li> On the same coordinate grid, graph the following linear functions. Use a different color for each:\n    <ol type=\"a\">\n<li>\\(\n        f(x)=3x\\) </li>\n<li>\\(\n        f(x)=2x\\) </li>\n<li>\\(f(x)=x\\)<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>What do you notice about the slopes of lines \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as the number gets larger?<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Now, graph lines \\(d\\) and \\(e\\) on the same graph as \\(a\\)&ndash;\\(c\\), but use different colors.</li>\n<ol start=\"4\" type=\"a\">\n<li>\\(f(x)=\\frac12 x\\)</li>\n<li>\\(\n      f(x)=\\frac13 x\\) <br>\n<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<li>How does line \\(d\\) compare to line \\(b\\)? What can you say about the lines when \\(m&lt;1\\)?<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Now graph lines \\(f\\), \\(g\\), and \\(h\\) on the same coordinate grid as \\(a\\)&ndash;\\(e\\), but use different colors.</li>\n<ol start=\"6\" type=\"a\">\n<li>\\(f(x)=-\\frac12 x\\) </li>\n<li>\\(f(x)=-x\\)</li>\n<li>\\(f(x)=-2x\\)<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<li>What changed with these functions? How did this change their graphs?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the equation \\(f(x)=mx\\), the \\(m\\) is acting as the vertical stretch or vertical compression of the identity function. When \\(m\\) is negative, there is also a vertical reflection of the graph.</p>\n<p>Multiplying the equation of \\(f(x)=x\\) by \\(m\\) stretches the graph of \\(f\\) by a factor of \\(m\\) units if \\(m&gt;1\\) and compresses the graph of \\(f\\) by a factor of \\(m\\) units if \\(0&lt;m&lt;1\\). This means the larger the absolute value of \\(m\\), the steeper the slope.</p>\n<h4>Video: Identifying Vertical Stretches and Compressions</h4>\n<p>Watch the following video to learn more about vertical stretches and compressions.</p>\n<video controls=\"true\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" width=\"550\">\n<source src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/ab2d0745a29cce32d6c39a82461fc1d15be37057\">\n<track default=\"true\" kind=\"captions\" label=\"On\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b8785f2e173176360bdf2f05e88af8014891800f\" srclang=\"en_us\">\n  https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/ab2d0745a29cce32d6c39a82461fc1d15be37057\n</video>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><img alt=\"This graph shows seven versions of the function, f of x = x on an x, y coordinate plane.

The equation for the function also shows that \\(b=&minus;3\\), so the identity function is vertically shifted down 3 units. First, graph the identity function, and show the vertical compression as in Figure 16.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"This graph shows two functions on an x, y coordinate plane.

An arrow pointing downward from the first function to the second function reveals the vertical shift.</p>\n<p><strong>Can we sketch a graph by reversing the order of the transformations?</strong></p>\n<p>No. The order of the transformations follows the order of operations. When the function is evaluated at a given input, the corresponding output is calculated by following the order of operations. So, the stretch was performed before the vertical shift.</p>\n<br>\n<h4>Try It: Transformations of Linear Functions</h4>\n<p>Name the transformations to go from the parent function, \\(f(x)=x\\), to \\(f(x)=4+2x\\).</p>\n<p>In your notebook, write down your answer. Then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to check your work.</p>\n<h5>Solution</h5>\n<p>Here is how to determine the transformations:</p>\n<p>First, the slope, \\(m=2\\), tells that there is a vertical stretch of 2.</p>\n<p>Next, the \\(y\\)-intercept is 4, so there is a vertical shift up 2.</p>\n<p>How did you do?
