Alternatively, if students are familiar with the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, use this activity instead, and use the structure of the launch and discussion for the Tower of Hanoi activity for the discussion of this activity.</p>\n<p>This activity works best when each student has access to manipulatives or devices that can run the GeoGebra applet because students will benefit from seeing the relationship in a dynamic way. If students don&rsquo;t have individual access, projecting the applet during the launch is helpful.</p>\n<p>Monitor for students writing clear explanations for Noah&rsquo;s reasoning and for the number of moves needed for 7 checkers on each side to share during the discussion.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Students can use the embedded applet below.</p>\n<p>Ask students to read the rules to the puzzle and then give them time to solve the puzzle when there are 3 spaces and 1 checker on each side. Remind them they need to keep track of the number of moves needed since the goal is to find the smallest number of moves. Encourage groups to check in with those around them to see if anyone found a solution with fewer moves. Before groups begin work on the rest of the questions, select a student to demonstrate, using the applet, why it takes 3 moves to solve the puzzle when there are 3 spaces and 1 checker on each side as a check that everyone understands the rules of the game.</p>\n<h4>Access for Students with Disabilities&nbsp;</h4>\n<div>\n<p>Use virtual or concrete manipulatives to connect symbols to concrete objects. Provide black and red checkers if the applet is not available.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h4> Student-Facing Statement </h4>\n<br>\n<iframe height=\"350px\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.geogebra.org/material/iframe/id/qugvaudj/width/681/height/350/border/888888/sfsb/true/smb/false/stb/false/stbh/false/ai/false/asb/false/sri/true/rc/false/ld/false/sdz/false/ctl/false\" title=\"Alg2 Moving Checkers\" width=\"681px\"> </iframe>\n<br>\n<p>Some checkers are lined up, with blue on one side, red on the other, and 1 empty space between them. A move in this checker game pushes any checker forward 1 space, or jumps over any 1 checker of the other color. Jumping the same color is not allowed, moving backward is not allowed, and 2 checkers cannot occupy the same space.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"THREE BLACK CHECKERS, A SPACE, AND THEN THREE RED CHECKERS.\n\" class=\"img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom\" height=\"43\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/0830b28585b143bb3a3fa0c6a4ab68e6bda92a3b\" width=\"298\"></p>\n<p>You complete the puzzle by switching the colors completely: ending up with black on the right, red on the left, and 1 empty space between them.</p>\n<ol>\n<li> Using 1 checker on each side, complete the puzzle. What is the smallest number of moves needed? </li>\n<li> Using 3 checkers on each side, complete the puzzle. What is the smallest number of moves needed? </li>\n<li> Estimate the number of moves needed if there are 2 or 4 checkers on each side. Then test your guesses. </li>\n<li> Noah says he used the solution for 3 checkers on each side to help him solve the puzzle for 4 checkers. Describe how this might happen. </li>\n<li> How many moves do you think it will take to complete a puzzle with 7 checkers on each side? </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<ol>\n<li> 3 moves </li>\n<li> 15 moves </li>\n<li> 8 moves and 24 moves </li>\n<li> Sample response: The moves that don&rsquo;t involve the fourth checker on each side are the same as before, so it is possible to decide the number of moves by running the first half of the three-checker game, then moving the fourth checkers, and then running the second half. </li>\n<li> 63 moves </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>\n<p>Students may incorrectly interpret the rules or presume that there is no better solution once they find one solution that works. Encourage groups to regularly switch who is in charge of moving the checkers and to check with other groups around them once they think they have found a solution with the smallest number of moves.</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Select students to share the smallest number of moves they found for 2, 3, and 4 checkers on each side. Each time, ask whether anyone in the class solved it with fewer moves. If no one finds the minimal solution, ask students to keep looking if time allows, or share the minimum number of moves and challenge them to do it, or demonstrate the minimal solution.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Invite previously identified students to share their explanation for Noah&rsquo;s strategy and the number of moves needed to complete a puzzle with 3 checkers on each side. The bottom row of the table should now have the numbers 3, 8, 15, and 24 filled in.</p>\n<p>If this activity was used instead of the Tower of Hanoi, make sure to define &ldquo;sequence&rdquo; and &ldquo;term&rdquo; for students before inviting students to describe a rule for the next term in the pattern. After a brief quiet think time, select 2&ndash;3 students to share their thinking and write down any notation they come up with to describe the recursive rule, such as &ldquo;first add 5, and then keep adding the next odd number.&rdquo; There is no need to introduce formal notation or discuss a specific rule for finding term \\(n\\) at this time, but if students suggest these (time permitting), welcome their explanations.</p>\n<h3>4.13.3: Self Check&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><em><strong>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</strong></em></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"312\">\n<col width=\"312\">\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p><strong>QUESTION:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The table below shows the number of checkers and the number of moves needed to win a skipping game.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<colgroup>\n<col>\n<col>\n<col>\n<col>\n<col>\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Number of Checkers</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>1</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>2</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>3</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Number of Skips Needed</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>2</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>8</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>18</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>32</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p>How many skips are needed with 6 checkers on each side?</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>50</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Incorrect.
