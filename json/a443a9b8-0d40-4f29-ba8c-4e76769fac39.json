You will solve addition and subtraction problems using polynomial functions. You will be able to check your work by evaluating these functions and solutions for given values.</p>\n<p>Polynomials are frequently used in calculating physics problems and other real-world situations involving projectiles and the motion of objects. Mastering the polynomial operations in this unit will help you in future studies.</p>\n<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Determine the degree of polynomials. </li>\n<li> Add and subtract polynomials. </li>\n<li> Evaluate a polynomial function for a given value. </li>\n<li> Add and subtract polynomial functions. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 6.1.1: Understanding Polynomials </li>\n<li> 6.1.2: Adding and Subtracting Polynomials </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 6.1.2: Self Check </li>\n<li>6.1.2: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n<li> 6.1.3: Evaluating a Polynomial Function for a Given Value </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 6.1.3: Self Check </li>\n<li>6.1.3: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n<li> 6.1.4: Adding and Subtracting Polynomial Functions </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 6.1.4: Self Check </li>\n<li>6.1.4: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n<li> 6.1.5: Reviewing Polynomial Addition and Subtraction </li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 6.1.6: Practice </li>\n<li> 6.1.7: Lesson Summary </li>\n</ul>"
