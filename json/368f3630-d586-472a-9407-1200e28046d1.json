You began to recognize that some variables may be related, but one does not always cause the other to change. You were able to recognize that at this point, the mathematics of scatter plot analysis cannot determine whether there is a causal relationship. You recognized that the relationship must be thought through carefully to decide, based on the situation, whether the related variables have a causal relationship.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>3.6.2: Self Check</li>\n<li>3.6.3: Using the Term Causal Relationship\n        <ul>\n<li>In this activity, you practiced using the term causal relationship and thought of situations to which it might apply and whether relationships were causal.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>3.6.3: Self Check</li>\n<li>3.6.4:Determining the Type of Relationship\n        <ul>\n<li>In this activity, you decided if variable pairs had a very weak or no relationship, a strong relationship that is not a causal relationship, or a causal relationship.<br></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following<b>practice</b>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3.6.5: Practice</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<!--Q1-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n<p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<p>Correct!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!----------------- Must be included at the bottom of page for dropdown to work ------------>\n<!--Do not edit below line.-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n</div>"
