These understandings help students develop fluency and will be helpful later in this lesson when students will need to be able to compute residuals from a linear model.</span></p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ask students, &ldquo;How would the answers to these two questions be different?&rdquo;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Actual value: 21 cars. Estimated value: 20 cars</li>\n  <li>Actual value: 20 cars. Estimated value: 21 cars</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">(The first question has an answer of 1 car. The second question has an answer of \\(-1\\) car.)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Display one problem at a time. Give students quiet time to think individually for each problem and ask them to give a signal when they have an answer and a strategy. Keep all problems displayed throughout the talk. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>\n<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n<div>\n  <p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Representation: Internalize Comprehension. </em>To support working memory, provide students with sticky notes or mini whiteboards.</p>\n  <p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Supports accessibility for: Conceptual processing; Memory</em></p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mentally calculate how close the estimate is to the actual value using the difference:&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>actual value &minus; estimated value.</em></p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" type=\"a\">\n  <li><span>Actual value: 24.8 grams. Estimated value: 19.6 grams</span></li>\n  <li><span>Actual value: $112.11. Estimated value: $109.30</span></li>\n  <li><span>Actual value: 41.5 centimeters. Estimated value: 45.90 centimeters</span></li>\n  <li><span>Actual value: \\(-1.34\\) degrees Celsius. Estimated value: \\(-2.45\\) degrees Celsius</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Compare your answer:</span></p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" type=\"a\">\n  <li>5.2 grams</li>\n  <li>$2.81</li>\n  <li>\\(-4.4\\) centimeters</li>\n  <li>1.11 degrees Celsius</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ask students to share their strategies for each problem. Record and display their responses for all to see. To involve more students in the conversation, consider asking:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>&ldquo;Who can restate _______&rsquo;s reasoning in a different way?&rdquo;</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;Did anyone have the same strategy but would explain it differently?&rdquo;</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;Did anyone solve the problem in a different way?&rdquo;</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;Does anyone want to add on to _______&rsquo;s strategy?&rdquo;</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;Do you agree or disagree? Why?&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>\n<div>\n  <p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Speaking: MLR8 Discussion Supports. </em>Display sentence frames to support students when they explain their strategy. For example: &ldquo;First, I _____ because . . . .&rdquo; or &ldquo;I noticed _____ so I . . . .&rdquo; Some students may benefit from the opportunity to rehearse what they will say with a partner before they share with the whole class.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>"
