It needs to follow the trend of the data, it should go roughly through the middle of the data, and it should have roughly the same number of data points on either side of it.)</li>\n<li>&ldquo;Which line fits the data better, the solid line or the dashed line? Do you think it is the line of best fit? Explain your reasoning.&rdquo; (The dashed line fits the data better because its slope and vertical intercept more closely resemble the trend of the data than the slope and vertical intercept of the solid line. It is not the line of best fit because it does not go through the middle of the data. It should be a little lower on the graph.)&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Discrete graph with 2 lines.\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/9c5318d919a06e1c78ad73295d7bb2a0e345eeed\"><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p>\n<p><br></p>"
