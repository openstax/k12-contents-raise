The numbers were written in both decimal and fraction form, and you may have noticed different patterns in each format.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 5.7.2: Comparing Graphs <ul>\n      <li> In this activity, you looked at the graphs of the values of different cell phones over time. You were able to analyze each cell phone and compare them to one another by looking at key features of the graphs. </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><span>5.7</span><span>.2: Self Check&nbsp;</span><br></li>\n  <li> 5.7.3: Describing Graphs&nbsp; <ul>\n      <li> In this activity, you connected the verbal description of a graph to the matching graph. Each description was a real-life scenario, and all of the graphs were exponential. You had to consider words that represent different growth rates and whether the situation was growth or decay. </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><span>5.7.3: Sel</span><span>f Check&nbsp;</span><br></li>\n  <li> 5.7.4: Quantities that Change Exponentially </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> In this activity, you analyzed a graph and determined which of the scenarios provided it matches. It was a wrap up of all of the other skills from this lesson. </li>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 5.7.5: Practice </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-content-id=\"8bdf3931-b757-4bf1-90b6-9dc0bb0bcbf7\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <!--pulldown-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-content-id=\"bf531b41-ce25-47a9-acbd-b1fd94589e51\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n      <p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n      <p>Correct!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n      <p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!--Do not edit below line.-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n</div>"
