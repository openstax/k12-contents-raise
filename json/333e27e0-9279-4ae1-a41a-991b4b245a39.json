He has been offered two part-time jobs: working in the guest-services department at a hotel and waiting tables at a popular restaurant.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The job at the hotel pays <span>$</span>18 an hour and offers $33 in transportation allowance per month.</li>\n  <li>The job at the restaurant pays <span>$</span>7.50 an hour plus tips. The entire wait staff typically collects about $50 in tips each hour. Tips are divided equally among the 4 wait staff members who share a shift.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<!--Text Entry Interaction Start -->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"eventShow\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-content\">\n    <ol>\n      <li>\n        The equation&nbsp;\\( 7.50h + \\frac {50}{4}h = 18h + 33 \\)&nbsp;represents a possible constraint about a situation.</li>\n      <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" type=\"a\">\n        <li>Solve the equation and check your solution.</li>\n        <li>Here is a graph on a number line.<br><img alt=\"A blank number line is shown with an open circle on a point in the middle.\n\" height=\"16\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/3ab9d6c1efc50cac2d8c8e66fde938a8366ee2ea\" width=\"359\"><br>\n          Put a scale on the number line so that the point marked with a circle represents the solution to the equation.\n        </li>\n      </ol>\n    </ol>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-prompt\">\n    <p>Enter your answer here:</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-ack\">\n    <p>Check your answers:</p>\n    <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" type=\"a\">\n      <li><span>\\( h=16.5 \\)</span><br></li>\n      <li><span>Sample response</span><br></li>\n    </ol>\n    <img alt=\" A number line is shown from 14 to 19 with an \nopen circle on 16.5.\n\" height=\"49\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/cbb591ba5a80826249f1873eaae5aa3e06798849\" width=\"400\">\n  </div>\n</div>\n<!--Interaction End -->\n<br>\n<!--Text Entry Interaction Start -->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"eventShow\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-content\">\n    <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n      <li>\n        Does one job pay better if:\n        <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" type=\"a\">\n          <li>The student works fewer hours than the solution you found earlier?
