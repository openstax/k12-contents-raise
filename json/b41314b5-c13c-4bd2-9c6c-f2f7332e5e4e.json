The big thing you learned is that the discovered patterns help determine the function rule. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 7.5.2: A Time-Distance Quadratic Model </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> In this activity, you built a very simple quadratic model using given time-distance data of a free-falling rock. The big thing you learned is that the motion of a falling object is commonly modeled with a quadratic function. </li>\n    <li> 7.5.2: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 7.5.2: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 7.5.3: Distance as a Quadratic Function of Elapsed Time </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> In this activity, you continued to explore how quadratic functions can model the movement of a falling object by evaluating the function seen earlier in the lesson. Then you built a new function to represent the distance from the ground of a falling object \\(t\\) seconds after it is dropped. </li>\n    <li> 7.5.3: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 7.5.3: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 7.5.4: A Quadratic Expression that Represents the Relationship Between Distance and Time </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> In this activity, you wrote expressions that represent the distance in feet of an object when it falls after \\(t\\) seconds. </li>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following<strong> practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 7.5.5: Practice </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-content-id=\"b1fcad93-8e3a-46bf-aa7b-c7f5bacfaed6\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <!--pulldown-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-content-id=\"b42087a3-193c-4e70-8e8b-c0756595d98e\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n      <p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n      <p>Correct!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n      <p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!--Do not edit below line.-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n</div>"
