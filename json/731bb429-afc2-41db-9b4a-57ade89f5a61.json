From the factored form, we can tell that the graph intersects the horizontal axis at \\(t=1\\). The zero of the function is the same value.</p>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>What do the zeros tell us in this situation?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The zeros mean the time in seconds when the ball is on the ground.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Are both zeros meaningful?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer: </strong>No. Only one of them is meaningful. The negative zero doesn't mean anything here.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>From what height, in feet, is the beach ball thrown? Explain or show your reasoning.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 2. The height when \\(t=0\\) is \\((-16(0)&minus;2)(0&minus;1)=(-2)(-1)=2\\). If you graph the function, the graph shows a y-intercept of \\((0,2)\\).</p>\n<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>\n<h5>Press Pause</h5>\n<p>If students struggle to interpret functions in context, plan to spend extra time on this topic before the assessment by reviewing activities and practice problems.</p>"
