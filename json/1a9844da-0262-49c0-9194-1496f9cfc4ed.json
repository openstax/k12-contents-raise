I graphed it, and it doesn&rsquo;t look geometric.&rdquo;</p>\n<br>\n<!--Text Entry Interaction Start -->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"eventShow\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-content\">\n<p>Do you agree with Jada or Mai? Explain or show your reasoning using a graph.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-prompt\">\n<p>Enter your answer here:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-ack\">\n<p>Compare your answer:</p>\n<p>I agree with Mai. Jada noticed that each value is multiplied by 3 to get to the next row, but the table skips terms. If the sequence were geometric, it would have to be 2, 6, 18, 54, 108. When Mai made a graph, she could see the gap in the sequence.\n        </p>\n<p><img alt class=\"img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom\" height=\"186\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/im-ims-export/tM9DHpxLoiU8GUDQYGZZ2ybm\" width=\"201\"></p>\n<p>Without knowing the missing terms, we don&rsquo;t know for sure if the sequence is arithmetic, but it could be since the three given points are all on the same line with slope 4. The missing points could be \\((3,10)\\) and \\((4,14)\\) so that the sequence would be 2, 6, 10, 14, 18.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!--Interaction End -->"
