To keep the two sides equal, it needs to be added to the other side as well.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\">\n  <li>What happened between Step 5 and Step 6?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The perfect square is rewritten in factored form, and \\(-32+3^2\\) is rewritten as \\(3^2-32\\).</p>\n<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>\n<h5>Points to Emphasize</h5>\n<p>If students struggle with completing the square, have them revisit the Additional Resources in 9.1&ndash;9.3. If students struggle with recognizing the quadratic formula, have them revisit the Additional Resources in 9.6 and 9.7.</p>"
