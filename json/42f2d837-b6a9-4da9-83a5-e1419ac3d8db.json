Students are likely to recognize the 5, 25, 125 in the decimal expansion as powers of 5 and use that insight to describe the pattern, to extend it, and to notice other related patterns. In this warm-up, they are not expected to reason about why the non-zero digits of the decimal expansions of powers of \\(\\frac12\\) are related to powers of 5.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Encourage them to think quietly for a minute before sharing their responses with their partner.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>In the table, find as many patterns as you can. Use one or more patterns to help you complete the table. Be prepared to explain your reasoning.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"70\">\n    <col width=\"39\">\n    <col width=\"39\">\n    <col width=\"47\">\n    <col width=\"53\">\n    <col width=\"53\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>fraction</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(\\frac12\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(\\frac14\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(\\frac18\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(\\frac{1}{16}\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(\\frac{1}{32}\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>decimal</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>0.5</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>0.25</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>0.125</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>a._____</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>b._____</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p>a. _____ <br>\n  <strong>Answer:</strong> 0.0625\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Each number is half of the previous number.

If not already mentioned by students, discuss:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>&ldquo;Are the successive numbers exhibiting linear or exponential change? How do you know?&rdquo;</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;Are the successive numbers getting larger or smaller? How do you know?&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If time permits, consider asking: &ldquo;Why do powers of 5 show up in the decimals?&rdquo;</p>"
