In construction the pitch of a\n        roof, the slant of the plumbing pipes, and the steepness of the stairs\n        are all applications of slope. As you ski or jog down a hill, you\n        definitely experience a slope.</p>\n      <div>We can assign a numerical\n        value to the slope of a line by finding the ratio of the rise and run.\n        The rise is the amount the vertical distance changes while the run\n        measures the horizontal change, as shown in this illustration.
