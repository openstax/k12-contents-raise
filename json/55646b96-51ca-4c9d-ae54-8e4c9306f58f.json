In this lesson, you will use graphing technology to analyze data sets so that you can identify a curve of best fit for any given data. You will then use the curve of best fit to make accurate predictions about real-world situations.</p>\n<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> Graph a quadratic data set using technology. </li>\n<li> Find a regression curve, or curve of best fit, using a quadratic data set. </li>\n<li> Use a regression curve to create a quadratic model for making predictions. </li>\n<li> Make predictions about a real-world situation using a quadratic data set. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> 8.12.1: Graphing a Quadratic Data Set Using Technology </li>\n<li> 8.12.2: Finding the Curve of Best Fit </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 8.12.2: Self Check </li>\n<li> 8.12.2: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 8.12.3: Making Predictions Using a Quadratic Model </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 8.12.3: Self Check </li>\n<li> 8.12.3: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 8.12.4: Finding the Missing Data in the Set </li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that, you'll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> 8.12.5: Practice </li>\n<li> 8.12.6: Lesson Summary </li>\n</ul>"
