Emphasize that the graphs that represent quadratic functions that model other kinds of situations can also be interpreted in context. For example, in an earlier lesson we saw a quadratic function defined by \\(r(d)=d(600-75d)\\). It described the revenue in thousands of dollars collected from ticket sales as a function of the price of one ticket.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> \"What can you tell about the ticket sales and revenue from the equation?\" (If the ticket is sold for 0 dollars, or if \\(d=0\\), the revenue will be 0.) </li>\n  <li> \"In what form is the quadratic expression defining \\(r\\) written?\" (Factored form) \"If we rewrite it in standard form, what new information would we gain?\" (In standard form, the equation is \\(r(d)=60d-75d^2\\). It gives us the vertical intercept, but that is not new information. We saw that one of the horizontal intercepts is at \\((0,0)\\), so the vertical intercept is known.) </li>\n  <li> \"Here is the graph representing the same function. What information does the horizontal intercepts, the vertical intercept, and the vertex of the graph give us?\" (The horizontal intercepts tell us that no revenue will be collected if the tickets are sold at $0 and $8. The vertical intercept gives the same information: that if the ticket is free, there will be no revenue. The vertex tells us that the greatest revenue will be collected when the ticket is sold at $4 each, and that amount is $1,200.) </li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt='Graph of parabola&nbsp; height=\"179\"' height=\"239\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/6e98447c200a26cbaa7ef474f2eadae07117bc87\" width=\"328\"></p>"
