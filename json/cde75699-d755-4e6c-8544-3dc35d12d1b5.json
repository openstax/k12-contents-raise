Then look if the parabola is opening up or down. Finally, use another point to determine if the graph has been compressed or stretched. Recall this type of transformation will affect the \\(a\\)-value of the equation.</p>\n<p>Looking at the graph below, choose the equation that matches the graph.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"GRAPH OF A PARABOLA THAT OPENS UP WITH A VERTEX AT (NEGATIVE 2, NEGATIVE 3).\" height=\"296\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/e8f20cb5a53f3f5adc16739395465feb2a796acf\" width=\"300\"></p>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n  <li> \\(y=(x-2)^2-3\\) </li>\n  <li> \\(y=(x+2)^2-3\\) </li>\n  <li> \\(y=-(x+2)^2-3\\) </li>\n  <li> \\(y=-(x-2)^2-3\\) </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Step 1<br>\n  Find the vertex.<br>\n  The vertex is at \\((-2, -3)\\).</p>\n<p>Step 2<br>\n  Does the parabola open up or down?<br>\n  The parabola opens up.
