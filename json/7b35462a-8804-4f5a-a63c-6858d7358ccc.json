The equation \\(n=75\\cdot 3^t\\) gives the total number of mice, \\(n\\), \\(t\\) years since the survey began. Explain what the numbers 75 and 3 mean in this situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 75 is the initial number of mice in the forest when the survey started, or the number of mice when \\(t\\) is 0. The 3 is the growth factor or constant ratio, meaning that each year, the population of mice in the forest is 3 times the previous year&rsquo;s population.</p>\n<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>\n<h5>More Chances</h5>\n<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>"
