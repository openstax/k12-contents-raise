They also observed that the factored form can also help us solve quadratic equations algebraically. In this lesson, students begin to rewrite quadratic expressions from standard to factored form.</p>\n<p>In an earlier unit, students learned to expand quadratic expressions in factored form and rewrite them in standard form. They did so by applying the distributive property to multiply out the factors&mdash;first by using diagrams for support, and then by relying on structure they observed in the process. The attention to structure continues in this lesson. Students relate the numbers in the factored form to the coefficients of the terms in standard form, looking for structure that can be used to go in reverse&mdash;from standard form to factored form.</p>\n<p>This lesson only looks at expressions of the form \\((x + m)(x + n)\\) and \\((x &minus; m)(x &minus; n)\\) where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are positive. This is so that arithmetic doesn&rsquo;t get in the way of noticing the relationships between the numbers in factored form and the numbers in standard form. In the next lesson, students will encounter expressions of the form \\((x + m)(x &minus; n)\\) and \\((x &minus; m)(x + n)\\).</p>\n<p>Note that this course includes only four lessons on transforming quadratic expressions from standard form to factored form. This is intentional. The goal is to help students see factored form conceptually, understand what it can tell us about the function, and use that knowledge in modeling problems, including problems where the zeros are not rational and algebraic factoring wouldn&rsquo;t help. Too much attention to the algebraic skill of factoring can obscure these underlying concepts.</p>\n<p>Sometimes&mdash;including in later courses and beyond&mdash;expressions do need to be written in factored form. With the universal availability of computer algebra systems, however, there is less need to spend lots of time learning how to factor by hand.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Apply the distributive property to multiply two sums or two differences, using a rectangular diagram to illustrate the distribution as needed. </li>\n  <li> Generalize the relationship between equivalent quadratic expressions in standard form and factored form, and use the generalization to transform expressions from one form to the other. </li>\n  <li> Use a diagram to represent quadratic expressions in different forms and explain (orally and in writing) how the numbers in the factors relate to the numbers in the product. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Explain how the numbers in a quadratic expression in factored form relate to the numbers in an equivalent expression in standard form. </li>\n  <li> Rewrite a quadratic expression in standard form when given the quadratic expression in factored form. </li>\n  <li> Rewrite a quadratic expression in factored form when given the quadratic expression in the form of \\(x^2+ bx + c\\). </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>A8(A) solve quadratic equations having real solutions by factoring, taking square roots, completing the square, and applying the quadratic formula.</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Foundational: Lesson provides foundational content necessary for students to be able to perform this TEKS in later lessons.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> 8.6.1: Finding and Reasoning Unknown Factors </li>\n  <li> 8.6.2: Using Diagrams to Understand Equivalent Expressions </li>\n  <ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n    <li> 8.6.2: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 8.6.2: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 8.6.3: Rewriting Quadratic Expressions in Standard Form </li>\n  <ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n    <li> 8.6.3: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 8.6.3: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 8.6.4: Finding the Missing Numbers in Pairs of Equivalent Expressions </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 8.6.5: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Paper and pencil </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> None </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson. </li>\n  <li> Encourage students to look for these words and notice their use and meanings. </li>\n  <li> Encourage students to use key vocabulary words in &ldquo;math talk&rdquo; and their written and oral explanations. </li>\n  <li> Utilize a word wall.
