Horizontal axis, x, from 0 to 40 by 10's. Vertical axis, y, from 0 to 1,000, by 500's. Line crosses &nbsp;y axis at 0 comma 400, quickly decreasing then running horizontal to x axis.\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/3e638689244b1a3a2db07f7306f1d2d6e5d337ad\"></p>\n<ol>\n  <li> Identify the approximate graphing window shown. <br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> \\(0&lt;x&lt;44\\) and \\(0&lt;y&lt;1,100\\) or equivalent\n  </li>\n  <br>\n  <li> Suggest a new graphing window that would: </li>\n  <br>\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" type=\"a\">\n    <li> make the graph more informative or meaningful .<br>\n      <strong>Answer:</strong> \\(\n      0&lt;x&lt;10\\) and \\(0&lt;y&lt;450\\). This window would include \\(x\\)-values where meaningful changes happen and exclude the parts where the changes are very small. The \\(y\\)-values are limited to values that matter, between 0 and 400, allowing us to see more clearly the changes in that range.\n    </li>\n    <br>\n    <li> make the graph less informative or meaningful.&nbsp;<br>\n      <strong>Answer:</strong> \\(-10&lt;x&lt;80\\) and \\(10&lt;y&lt;100\\). This window would show a lot of useless \\(x\\)-values and cut off the \\(y\\)-values at 100, which would make the behavior of the function when \ud835\udc65 is between 0 and 1 very difficult to observe.\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n</ol>\n<p>Be prepared to explain your reasoning.</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Invite students to share some suggestions for a graphing window that are more helpful and those that are less helpful. Ask them to explain their reasoning.</p>\n<p>Help students understand that, as a general rule, the \\(x\\)-values to show for a graph are usually determined by the quantity we are interested in studying. The \\(y\\)-values need to be selected carefully so that:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>data of interest show up on the graph. </li>\n  <li>interesting trends (of increase or decrease) are as visible as possible. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>If time permits, discuss:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>&ldquo;Why does the graph show such a sharp decrease between \\(x\\)-values of 0 and 2 and then start to flatten out?&rdquo; (The decay factor is 0.2, which means that whenever \\(x\\) increases by 1, it loses 0.8 of its quantity and keeps only 0.2. That decay is more apparent when the quantity is larger. As it gets smaller, and given the scale of the graph, it is harder to see the change. For example, when \\(x\\) increases from 0 to 1, \\(f(x)\\) decreases by 320 because \\((0.8) \\cdot 400=320\\). But when \\(x\\) increases from 2 to 3, \\(f(x)\\) decreases by \\((0.8) \\cdot 16\\) or 10.8, which is a much smaller drop.) </li>\n</ul>"
