You explored bad fit, good fit, and best fit.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>3.2.2: Determining the Best Line That Fits the Data<ul>\n<li>In this activity, you distinguished between linear and nonlinear relationships in bivariate, numerical data and informally assessed the fit of a linear model. You also compared the slope and the vertical intercepts of different linear models and were able to describe the relationship between two variables.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>3.2.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li>3.2.3: Assessing the Fit of a Linear Model<ul>\n<li>In this activity, you used technology to compute a line of best fit for data given in a table and to recognize the meaning of the slope and \\(y\\)-intercept.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>3.2.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li>3.2.4: Working with Fitted Lines<ul>\n<li>In this activity, you had an opportunity to work with fitted lines. You identified scatter plots that showed data that would best be modeled with a linear function and the line of best fit for the data provided.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</span><br></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>3.2.5: Practice</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Checking In&nbsp;</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<!--Q1-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n<p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<p>Correct!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!----------------- Must be included at the bottom of page for dropdown to work ------------>\n<!--Do not edit below line.-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n</div>"
