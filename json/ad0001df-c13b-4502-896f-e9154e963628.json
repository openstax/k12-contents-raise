In this lesson, they see that depending on the quantity in which we are interested, one form of equation might be more useful than others. Pinning down a quantity of interest may mean manipulating or rearranging a given equation. The rearrangement may involve solving for a variable&mdash;isolating it and defining it in terms of the other variables. Students notice that solving for a variable can be an efficient way to solve problems and to avoid cumbersome calculations.</p>\n        <p>Throughout the lesson, students reason repeatedly and look for regularity as they manipulate equations and solve for a variable (MP8).</p>\n      </div>\n      <h3>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h3>\n      <p><span>Students will be able to:</span><br></p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Comprehend that &ldquo;to solve for a variable&rdquo; is to rearrange an equation to isolate a variable of interest.</li>\n        <li>Rearrange multi-variable equations to highlight a particular quantity.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <ul>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Solve for a particular variable, given an equation</li>\n        <li>Determine the more useful form of an equation.</li>\n        <li>Explain the phrase &ldquo;to solve for a variable.&rdquo;</li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h3>\n      <div>\n        <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <td>\n                <p><strong><span>TEKS</span></strong></p>\n              </td>\n              <td>\n                <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>\n                <p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-f96e883f-7fff-5168-6c03-91bad78bb700\">A12(E) solve mathematic and scientific formulas, and other literal equations, for a specified variable.</span></p>\n              </td>\n              <td>\n                <p><em></em></p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-a14abaad-7fff-6657-2587-6d7799573897\">Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</span>\n                <p><em></em></p>\n              </td>\n            </tr>\n          </tbody>\n        </table>\n        <h3><br></h3>\n        <h3>Lesson Activities</h3>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:<br>&nbsp;<br>\n        <ul>\n          <li>1.8.1: Expressing Relationships Between Two Quantities</li>\n          <li>1.8.2: Identifying the Most Useful Form of an Equation<ul>\n              <li>1.8.2: Self Check </li>\n              <li>1.8.2: Additional Resources</li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n          <li>1.8.3: Writing Equations and Isolating Variables <ul>\n              <li>1.8.3: Self Check </li>\n              <li>1.8.3: Additional Resources</li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n          <li>1.8.4: Writing Equations Given Dimensions of Shapes</li>\n        </ul>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 1.8.5: Practice.<br><br>\n        <h3>Required Materials</h3>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Four-function calculators</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h3>Required Preparation</h3>\n        <div>\n          <ul>\n            <li>N/A</li>\n          </ul>\n          <h3>Lesson Vocabulary</h3>\n          <div>\n            <p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n            <ul>\n              <li>Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson.
