The number of squares in the pattern is related to the step number \\(n\\) by the rule \\(n^2+2\\). Because of the addition of 2 to \\(n^2\\), the squaring of \\(n\\) may not be as apparent as in the earlier activity (where the output values were perfect squares). This prompt gives students opportunities to see and make use of structure. A specific structure they might notice from the visual pattern is the 2-by-2 square in Step 2 and the 3-by-3 square in Step 3.</p>\n<p>As in the previous activity, students reason repeatedly, extend the pattern, and then write a general expression describing the pattern. They also consider whether the pattern is linear or exponential and explain why it is or isn't.</p>\n<p>As students work, look for students who draw a picture (especially for Step 5), those who describe the picture (especially for Steps 10 and 12), and those who rely on numerical (rather than visual) reasoning. Invite them to share their strategies during the synthesis of this activity.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Display the pattern of squares for all to see. Ask students to be prepared to share one thing they notice and one thing they wonder about. Give them a moment to share their observations and questions with a partner.</p>\n<p>The last question asks whether the pattern grows exponentially. If needed, remind students that a quantity that changes exponentially grows or decays by equal factors over equal intervals.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity </h4>\n<p><img alt=\"Three steps of a growing pattern.\" height=\"125\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/a565fecb7bfa3dc272c528be5f11d1b7e33a45f0\" width=\"422\"></p>\n<p>Here is a pattern of squares.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>Is the number of small squares growing linearly?

Explain how you know.<br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> No, from Step 1 to Step 2, the number of squares doubles. From Step 2 to Step 3, the number of squares increases by a factor of \\(\\frac{11}{6}\\). From Step 3 to Step 4, the number of squares increases by a factor of \\(\\frac{18}{11}\\).

Prompt them to compare Steps 2 and 3 and describe what stays the same and what changes. For example, the two small squares on either side stay the same, and the square in the middle increases. If needed, show them a drawing for Step 4 (two 1-by-1 squares on each side with a 4-by-4 square in the middle) and ask them to draw Step 5.</p>\n<p>Some students may not notice the table goes from Step 4 to Step 10 and record 27 (the number of small squares for Step 5) instead of 102. Prompt them to draw a picture of Step 10 and count the number of small squares in their drawing. Emphasize that when the step size increases by more than 1, we are skipping ahead several steps and our pattern needs to reflect that as well. Show students a table with the missing steps included so they can see the growth pattern.</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Select students to share their strategies for determining how the pattern was growing. Start from concrete approaches, relying on images, and work toward more abstract representations, using equations. Help students make connections between their conclusions by asking where the \\(+2\\) can be seen in the picture and where they see the \\(n^2\\) term. After the expression \\(n^2+2\\) comes up, introduce the term <em>quadratic</em>.</p>\n<p>Explain that the relationship between the step number and the number of squares is a quadratic relationship, which includes one quantity (the step number, in this case) being multiplied by itself to obtain a second quantity (the number of squares).</p>\n<p>In middle school, we expressed area of squares with side lengths \\(s\\) as \\(s^2\\). The relationship between the side length and the area of the square is a quadratic relationship. \\(s^2\\) is an example of a quadratic expression. The expression we wrote in this activity, \\(n^2+2\\), is also an example of a quadratic expression. A quadratic expression can be written using a squared term, but it can be written in other ways as well.</p>\n<p>If not already mentioned in students&rsquo; explanations, point out that:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> A quadratic relationship is not like a linear relationship because as one quantity increases by a certain amount, the second quantity doesn&rsquo;t increase by the same amount. </li>\n  <li> A quadratic relationship is not like an exponential relationship because as one quantity increases by a certain amount, the second quantity doesn&rsquo;t change by the same factor. (In this case, if the number of squares grew exponentially, this would mean that, from each step to the next, the number of squares is multiplied by the same factor.) </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>7.2.3: Self Check</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Ater the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>\n        <p>Which of the following is an example of a quadratic expression?</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(2n+4\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incorrect.
