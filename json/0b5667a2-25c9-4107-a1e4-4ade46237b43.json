You will also analyze two or more graphs simultaneously, interpreting their relative features and their average rates of change in context.</p>\n<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compare the features of graphs of functions and explain what they mean in the situations represented.</li>\n<li>Make sense of an equation of the form \\(f(x)=g(x)\\) in terms of a situation and a graph, and know how to find the solutions.</li>\n<li>Explain statements about two or more functions when they are written in function notation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4.9.1: Analyzing Graphs and Statements in Function Notation</li>\n<li>4.9.2: Interpreting Graphs and Statements in Terms of a Situation</li>\n<li>4.9.2: Self Check</li>\n<li>4.9.3: Comparing Functions Represented in Separate Graphs</li>\n<li>4.9.3: Self Check</li>\n<li>4.9.4: Compare Graphs and Statements that Represent Functions without a Context</li>\n<li>4.9.4: Self Check</li>\n<li>4.9.5: Analyzing Functions Using Real-World Context</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4.9.6: Practice</li>\n<li>4.9.7: Lesson Summary</li>\n</ul>"
