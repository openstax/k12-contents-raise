Students will find how many calories are burned on a treadmill and how far a train travels in a set amount of time.<br></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Launch</h3>\n<p>While students are working, be sure to circulate to make sure that groups are entering the correct values in equations. Ask questions like &ldquo;is that value the input or the output?&rdquo; And, &ldquo;which variable represents the input in your equation.&rdquo; After the activity, there is a video that will help struggling students solve direct variation problems. Finally, if there is extra time, have groups create another question from their given situation and give it to another group to solve it!</p>\n<h3>Student-Facing Statement&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Return to your original group and work through this next part of your assigned problem. Then be ready to share.&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When Raoul runs on the treadmill at the gym, the number of calories, c, he burns varies directly with the number of minutes, m, he uses the treadmill.
