Horizontal axis, 0 to 8, time, seconds. Vertical axis, 0 to 16, height, feet. Graph starts at 0 comma 9, increases, deceases to 4 comma 0, increases, then flattens out at 6 comma 10.\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/50aa7651b1fe19a899593f61b9abfcf0b087a126\"></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>What is the highest point the squirrel reaches?</li>\n  <li>Solve \\(h(t)=0\\). What does this solution tell you about the squirrel?</li>\n  <li>Find the vertical intercept of the graph. What does it tell you about the squirrel?</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<ol>\n  <li>14 feet</li>\n  <li>\\(t=4\\) means that after 4 seconds, the squirrel is at the bottom of the tree on the ground.</li>\n  <li>\\((0,9)\\) means that at the beginning, the squirrel is 9 feet high in the tree.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>\n<h5> More Chances</h5>\n<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>"
