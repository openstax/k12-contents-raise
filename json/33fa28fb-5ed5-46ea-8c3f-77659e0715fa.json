In this activity, students will work to find lines that are parallel and perpendicular to the \\( x \\)- and \\( y \\)-axes. To do this, students must have an understanding of the coordinate system. They must understand that the \\(y\\)-axis is vertical and the \\(x\\)-axis is horizontal. They must also understand that a coordinate is written in the form \\( (x, y) \\).</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Put students in pairs to work on this activity. Give each student a coordinate grid. A straight-edge and colored pencils would also help students visualize the different types of lines and their relationships.</p>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p>The line&nbsp;\\( x = 5 \\) and the point \\(&nbsp;(3, -2)&nbsp;\\) are shown on the graph.</p>\n<p><img alt class=\"atto_image_button_text-bottom\" height=\"321\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/6ab4e4d44454ea9de34c2ec04510c0d814f5dde7\" width=\"324\"><br></p>\n<p>Work with a partner to complete the tasks:</p>\n<p>1.

The slope of line \\(l\\) is undefined because it is a vertical line.)</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;How do you write the equation of a horizontal line with coordinates \\((a, b)\\)?&rdquo; \\((y = b)\\)</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;How do you write the equation of a vertical line with coordinates \\((a, b)\\)?&rdquo; \\((x = a)\\)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><br></h4>\n<p></p>\n<h4>1.13.3: Self Check&nbsp;</h4>\n<p><strong><em>Following the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\"><strong>QUESTION:</strong><br>Which is the equation of a line that is perpendicular to the line \\( x = 1 \\) that contains the point \\( (-5, 2) \\)?&nbsp;<br></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Answers</td>\n      <td>Feedback</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\\(&nbsp;y = 2&nbsp;&nbsp;\\)&nbsp;</td>\n      <td>\n        <p dir=\"ltr\">That&rsquo;s correct!
