They begin by analyzing and explaining the steps in a solution strategy, and then they apply their observations to solve other equations.</p>\n<p>As students work, notice the equations many students find challenging and those on which errors are commonly made. Discuss these challenges and errors during the activity synthesis.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Display Tyler's four steps in the activity statement for all to see.</p>\n<p>Give students one minute of quiet time to study the example. Ask them to be prepared to share at least one thing they notice and one thing they wonder. Give students another minute to discuss their observations and questions with a partner.</p>\n<p>Students may notice that:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> The right side is equal to 0 after the first step. </li>\n  <li> There are two equations starting in Step 3. </li>\n  <li> The product of 11 and &ndash;9 is the constant term in Step 2. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students may wonder:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> why there are two equations in the last two steps.</li>\n  <li> where the \\(-2n\\) went when the expression on the left side was written in factored form.</li>\n  <li> whether Tyler's work is correct.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, give students a moment to work quietly on the first four questions. Encourage students to use relevant mathematical vocabulary in their explanations (such as constant term, squared term, factored form, and zero product property).</p>\n<p>Before students proceed to questions 5&ndash;9, pause for a class discussion. Ask students to explain each step of Tyler's solving process and record their explanations for all to see. Encourage students to use reasoning language as opposed to position language: for instance, say \"he subtracted 99 from both sides\" rather than \"he moved the 99 over to the other side.\"</p>\n<p>Make sure students recognize that Step 2 in Tyler&lsquo;s work involves finding two factors of &ndash;99 that add up to &ndash;2. Also discuss why there are two equations at the end. Students should recall that if two numbers multiply to equal 0, then one of the factors must be 0.</p>\n<p>Ask students to solve as many equations in the second question as time permits.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity </h4>\n<p>To solve the equation \\(n^2 &minus; 2n = 99\\), Tyler wrote out the following steps.

Invite students to share how they solved that equation. Discuss questions such as:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li>\"Can we use the zero product property to write \\(x + 4 = 0\\) and \\(x + 5 = 0\\)? Why or why not?\" (No. The zero product property can only be applied to products that equal 0. The expression \\((x + 4)(x + 5) &minus; 30\\) has a product for one of its terms, but the expression itself is a difference.)</li>\n  <li>\"How can it be solved, other than by graphing?\" (We can expand the factored expressions using the distributive property and write an equivalent equation: \\(x^2 + 9x + 20 &minus; 30 = 0\\) or \\(x^2+ 9x &minus; 10 = 0\\). This last equation can then be written as \\((x + 10)(x &minus; 1) = 0\\), which allows it to be solved.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>8.9.2: Self Check</h3>\n<em><strong>\n    <p>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</p>\n  </strong></em>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>\n        <p>Solve the equation by rewriting it in factored form and then using the zero product property.</p>\n        <p>\\(x^2+ 3x &minus; 59 = &minus;5\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x=9\\) and \\(x=-6\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incorrect.
