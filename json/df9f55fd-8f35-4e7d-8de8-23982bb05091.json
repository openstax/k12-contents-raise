Students also revisit the idea that the solution, if there is one, can be represented graphically as the intersection of the graphs of the equations.</p>\n<p>Students write a system of equations to represent the quantities and constraints in each of several situations, find a solution that meets multiple constraints by graphing, and then interpret the solution in context. In the process, they reason both abstractly and quantitatively. As they analyze relationships mathematically and reflect on the results, students also engage in aspects of modeling.</p>\n<p>Some students who recall the work on systems of equations from grade 8 may choose to solve the systems algebraically. This is appropriate and welcome, but it is not necessary to introduce the idea to the class here. Students will use algebra to solve systems starting in the next lesson.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n</div>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Solve systems of linear equations by reasoning with tables and by graphing and explain (orally and in writing) the solution method.</li>\n<li>Explain that the solution to a system of equations in two variables is a pair of values that simultaneously make both equations true and that it is represented by the intersection point of the graphs of the equations.</li>\n<li>Explain that two (or more) equations that represent the constraints on the same quantities in the same situation form a system.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"body\">\n</div>\n<h3>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Explain &ldquo;the solution to a system of linear equations&rdquo; and how the solution is represented graphically.</li>\n<li>Refer to two equations as a system of equations.</li>\n<li>Use tables and graphs to solve systems of equations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h3>\n<p></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"624\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"312\">\n<p align=\"center\"><strong><span lang=\"EN\">TEKS</span></strong></p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"312\">\n<p align=\"center\"><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Explanation\n                                        of Coverage</span></strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"312\">\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">A.2(I) write systems of two linear equations given a table of\n                                    values, a graph, and a verbal description</span></p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"312\">\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this\n                                    TEKS.</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"312\">\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">A.3(F) <u>graph systems of two linear equations in two variables on\n                                        the coordinate plane and determine the solutions</u> if they exist</span></p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"312\">\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Partial coverage: Lesson provides content that covers part of this\n                                    TEKS.
