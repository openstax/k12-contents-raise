When the interval length is 1, the equal difference is the slope of a linear function. When the interval length is more than 1, the difference is the length of the interval times the slope. For an exponential function \\(f\\) given by \\(f(x)=a \\cdot b^x\\), when the interval length is 1, the factor of growth is \\(b\\). If the interval length is a whole number \\(n\\), then the factor of growth is \\(b^n\\).</p>\n<p>To justify why linear functions change by equal differences over equal intervals and exponential functions change by equal factors over equal intervals, students observe this structure repeatedly for specific numbers and then generalize this reasoning to apply to all intervals. Along the way, they need to recognize and use properties of exponents, which is an example of noticing and making use of structure.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Calculate rates of change of functions given graphs, equations, or tables. </li>\n  <li> Use rates of change and show that, for any equal intervals of the independent variable, an exponential function always increases or decreases by an equal factor. </li>\n  <li> Use rates of change to show that, for any equal intervals of the independent variable, a linear function always changes by an equal difference. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)&nbsp;</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li> Calculate rates of change of functions given graphs, equations, or tables. </li>\n  <li> Use rates of change to describe how a linear function and an exponential function change over equal intervals. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4> Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>A3(B) calculate the rate of change of a linear function represented tabularly, graphically, or algebraically in context of mathematical and real-world problems.</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 5.15.1: Writing Equivalent Expressions </li>\n  <li> 5.15.2: Linear Function Constant Rate of Change\n    <ul>\n      <li> 5.15.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n      <li>5.15.2: Additional Resources </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li> 5.15.3: Growth Rate of an Exponential Function\n    <ul>\n      <li> 5.15.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n      <li>5.15.3: Additional Resources </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li> 5.15.4: Comparing Linear and Exponential Growth </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 5.15.5: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<p>None</p>\n<h4> Required Preparation</h4>\n<p>None</p>\n<h4> Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson.
