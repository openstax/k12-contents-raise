For instance, what are the relevant quantities when planning for a pizza party? Are these quantities fixed or do they vary? How they might relate to one another? Are there any limitations or constraints on how much pizza should be ordered?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Tell which quantities in a situation can vary and which ones cannot.</li>\n  <li>Explain the meaning of the term &ldquo;constraint.&rdquo;</li>\n  <li>Use letters and numbers to write expressions representing the quantities in a situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>1.1.1: Understanding Value</li>\n  <li>1.1.2: Creating Expressions to Estimate Cost, Part 1<ul>\n      <li>1.1.2: Self Check</li>\n      <li>1.1.2: Additional Resources</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>1.1.3: Understanding Constraints<ul>\n      <li>1.1.3: Self Check</li>\n      <li>1.1.3: Additional Resources</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>1.1.4: Creating Expressions to Estimate Cost, Part 2</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>1.1.5: Practice</li>\n  <li>1.1.6: Lesson Summary</li>\n</ul>"
