      "html": "<h4>Writing Recursive Definitions</h4>\n<p>Sometimes we can define a sequence recursively. That is, we can describe how to calculate the next term in a sequence if we know the previous term.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a sequence: 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, . . . This is an arithmetic sequence, where each term is 4 more than the previous term. Since sequences are functions, let&rsquo;s call this sequence \\(f\\). Then we can use function notation to write \\(f(n)=f(n-1)+4\\). Here, \\(f(n)\\) is the term, \\(f(n-1)\\) is the previous term, and + 4 represents the common difference since \\(f\\) is an arithmetic sequence.</p>\n<p>When we define a function recursively, we must also say what the first term is. Without that, there would be no way of knowing if the sequence defined by \\(f(n)=f(n-1)+4\\) started with 6 or 81 or any other number. Here, one possible initial condition is \\(f(1)=6\\). It could also make sense to number the terms starting with 0, using \\(f(0)=6\\).</p>\n<p>Combining this information gives the recursive definition: \\(f(1)=6\\) and \\(f(n)=f(n-1)+4\\) for \\(n\\geq2\\), where \\(n\\) is an integer. We include the \\(n\\geq2\\) at the end since the value of \\(f\\) at 1 is already given, and the other terms in the sequence are generated by inputting integers larger than 1 into the definition.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some examples from the first activity and write the recursive definition for each type of sequence:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    A: 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, . . .\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Arithmetic<br>\n    <br>\n    \\(A(1)=30, A(n)=A(n-1)+10, n\\geq2\\)\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n  <li>\n    B: 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 2.5, . . .\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Geometric<br>\n    <br>\n    \\(B(1)=80, B(n)=B(n-1) \\frac12, n\\geq2\\)\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\">\n  <li>\n    F: 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, . . .\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Neither<br>\n    <br>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Try It: Writing Recursive Definitions</h4>\n<p>Write \\(E(1)\\) and a recursive definition for \\(E(n)\\):</p>\n<br>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"Reveal1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-content\">\n    <p>E: 20, 13, 6, &ndash;1, &ndash;8, . . .</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-prompt\">\n    <p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to compare your work.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-content\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\" data-wait-for-event=\"Reveal1\">\n  <p>Here is how to write the recursive definition for this sequence:</p>\n  <p>\\(E(1)=20\\), then each term after is formed by subtracting 7, so \\(E(n)=E(n-1)-7\\), \\(n\\geq2\\).</p>\n</div>"
