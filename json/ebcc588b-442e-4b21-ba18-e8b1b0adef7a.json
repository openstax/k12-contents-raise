When talking about each equation, you will need to discuss what the solution means in the context of the situation and if certain values are in fact solutions.</p>\n<p>Remember, if equations are equivalent and operations are applied correctly to both sides, the solution remains the same in all equivalent equations. If the operations are not applied to both sides properly, the solution will change.</p>\n<p>1. Noah is buying a pair of jeans and using a coupon for 10% off. The total price is&nbsp;$56.70, which includes&nbsp;$2.70 in sales tax. Noah&rsquo;s purchase can be modeled by the equation:</p>\n<p>\\( x - 0.1x + 2.70 = 56.70 \\)</p>\n<p>Discuss with a partner:<br></p>\n<div class=\"editor-indent\">a.
