This helps students practice substituting values for variables in formulas, which will be needed when finding equations of lines given different information. Finding the slope of a line is the first step in finding the equation of a line given two points.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Students will write equations of lines given certain information. Students are familiar with identifying the slope and \\(y\\)-intercept from the equation of a line. In this lesson, they will write the equation of a line given the slope and \\(y\\)-intercept. It can be helpful to use graphs of the lines so students can see how the values of the slope and \\(y\\)-intercept affect the graph.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Students will learn to use the point-slope form to write the equation of a line when given the slope and a point and when given two points. Students will use skills of manipulating equations as they substitute and solve. Encourage students to write out their steps and find ways to verify their answers, such as sharing with a partner or using a graphing utility or Desmos.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)&nbsp;</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Choose a method to write the equation of a line based on the information given.</span><br></li>\n<li>Use standard form, slope-intercept form, and point-slope form to write linear equations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)&nbsp;</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Write an equation of the line given the slope and \\( y \\)-intercept.</span></li>\n<li>Write an equation of the line given the slope and a point.</li>\n<li>Write an equation of the line given two points.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)&nbsp;</h4>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>TEKS</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A2(B) write linear equations in two variables in various forms, including\\( y = mx + b \\), \\( Ax + By = C \\), and \\( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\), given one point and the slope and given two points;<br></td>\n<td>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4><span>Lesson Activities</span><br></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1.12.1: Using the Slope Formula&nbsp;</li>\n<li>1.12.2: Writing an Equation Given the Slope and \\(y\\)-Intercept<ul>\n<li>1.12.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li>1.12.2: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>1.12.3: Writing an Equation Given the Slope and a Point<ul>\n<li>1.12.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li>1.12.3: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>1.12.4: Writing an Equation Given Two Points<ul>\n<li>1.12.4: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li>1.12.4: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>1.12.5: Choosing a Method to Write an Equation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Students will also complete a series of problems in the 1.12.6: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Slips to print out <a href=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/ecebe523130f6ce1351a12f192fe431aaf0fd878\" target=\"_blank\">Unit 1_Lesson 12.5_Slips_resource</a></li>\n<li><span>Graphing calculator or Desmos</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">N/A</p>\n<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>During this lesson, it is important to:</span><br></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><span>Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson.
