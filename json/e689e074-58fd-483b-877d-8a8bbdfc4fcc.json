Recall that this form is helpful for finding the zeros of the function (where the function has the value 0) and telling us the \\(x\\)-intercepts on the graph representing the function.</p>\n<p>Here is a graph representing \\(f\\). It shows two \\(x\\)-intercepts at \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=3\\).</p>\n<p><img alt=\" Graph on coordinate plane.\" height=\"263\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/im-ims-export/xhDeaHZzh2FhouPF6VeNd8nx\" width=\"317\"></p>\n<p>If we use &ndash;1 and 3 as outputs to \\(f\\), what are the outputs?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\\(\n        f(-1)=(-1+1)(-1-3)=(0)(-4)=0\\) </li>\n<li> \\(f(3)=(3+1)(3-3)=(4)(0)=0\\) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because the inputs &ndash;1 and 3 produce an output of 0, they are the zeros of the function \\(f\\). And because both \\(x\\) values have 0 for their \\(y\\) value, they also give us the \\(x\\)-intercepts of the graph (the points where the graph crosses the \\(x\\)-axis, which always have a \\(y\\)-coordinate of 0). So, the zeros of a function have the same values as the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the \\(x\\)-intercepts of the graph of the function.</p>\n<p>The factored form can also help us identify the vertex of the graph, which is the point where the function reaches its minimum value. Notice that the \\(x\\)-coordinate of the vertex is 1, and that 1 is halfway between &ndash;1 and 3. Once we know the \\(x\\)-coordinate of the vertex, we can find the \\(y\\)-coordinate by evaluating the function \\(f(1)=(1+1)(1-3)=(2)(-2)=-4\\). So the vertex is at \\((1, &ndash;4)\\).</p>\n<p>When a quadratic function is in standard form, the \\(y\\)-intercept is clear: its \\(y\\)-coordinate is the constant term \\(c\\) in \\(ax^2+bx+c\\). To find the \\(y\\)-intercept from factored form, we can evaluate the function at \\(x=0\\), because the \\(y\\)-intercept is the point where the graph has an input value of 0: </p>\n<p>\\(f(0)=(0+1)(0-3)=(1)(-3)=-3\\)</p>\n<h4>Try It: Graphing Quadratics with Points</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"Reveal1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-content\">\n<p>Find the zeros and vertex of the function \\(f\\) given by \\(f(x)=(x-4)(x+2)\\).
