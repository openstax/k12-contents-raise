In this\n  lesson, they shift their attention to inequalities. Here and in the next\n  two lessons, students interpret, write, and find solutions to\n  inequalities in one variable. The activities here are grounded in\n  contexts, and the ideas build on the work students have done in grade 7\n  (TEKS 7.10).</p>\n<p>The focus of this lesson is on\n  interpreting and writing inequalities that represent the constraints in\n  various situations. As students consider key quantities in a situation,\n  select variables to represent them, and decide whether multiple\n  inequalities (and which ones) are needed, they engage in aspects of\n  mathematical modeling.</p>\n<p>In future lessons, students will\n  use the insights from this lesson to find and interpret the solutions\n  to inequalities that model situations.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Interpret and write inequalities that represent the constraints in a situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>Write inequalities that represent the constraints in a situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<div align=\"left\" dir=\"ltr\"></div><strong></strong><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-18971228-7fff-a563-f794-7f11059780f6\">\n  <div align=\"left\" dir=\"ltr\">\n    <table>\n      <colgroup>\n        <col>\n        <col>\n      </colgroup>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n          </td>\n          <td>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">A5(B)\n              solve linear inequalities in one variable, including those for which\n              the application of the distributive property is necessary and for which\n              variables are included on both sides.</p>\n          </td>\n          <td>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Foundational: Lesson provides foundational content necessary for students to be able to perform this TEKS in later lessons.</p><br>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n  </div>\n</span><br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>2.7.1: Understanding Inequality Symbols</li>\n  <li>2.7.2: Identifying Constraints in Inequalities<ul>\n      <li>2.7.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n      <li>2.7.2: Additional Resources&nbsp;</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>2.7.3: Writing Inequalities to Represent Constraints<ul>\n      <li>2.7.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n      <li>2.7.3: Additional Resources&nbsp;</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>2.7.4: Writing More Inequalities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 2.7.5: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>N/A</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>N/A</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Familiarize students with\n    the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson.
