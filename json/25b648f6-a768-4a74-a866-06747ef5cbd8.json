You will solve equations that were previously only possible to solve using graphing by taking the following steps:</p>\n<p>Step 1: Rearrange equations so that one side of the equal sign is 0.<br>\n  Step 2: Rewrite the expression in factored form.<br>\n  Step 3: Use the zero product property.<br>\n  Step 4: Solve each equation.</p>\n<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Rearrange a quadratic equation to be written as <em>expression in factored form&nbsp;</em>\\(=0\\) and find the solutions. </li>\n  <li> Recognize quadratic equations that have zero, one, or two solutions when they are written in factored form. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> 8.9.1: Finding a Solution through Substitution </li>\n  <li> 8.9.2: Using Factored Form and the Zero Product Property to Solve Quadratic Equations </li>\n  <ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n    <li> 8.9.2: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 8.9.2: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 8.9.3: Writing an Equation to Represent a Quadratic Function with Only One Solution </li>\n  <ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n    <li> 8.9.3: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 8.9.3: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 8.9.4: Solving More Quadratic Equations </li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> 8.9.5: Practice </li>\n  <li>8.9.6: Lesson Summary</li>\n</ul>"
