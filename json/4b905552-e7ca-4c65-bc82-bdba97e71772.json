The aim is to also have points within a close distance to the line of best fit.</p>\n\n<p><span>Below are two examples of lines of best fit drawn through scatter plots.</span><br></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><img alt=\"Scatter plot with domain 0 to 10 and a range from -1 to 4 with the line of best fit drawn going through the points: (0,1.5); (1.5, -0.1); (2.1,1.9); (3.4, 1.5); (4.5,2.5); (5.8,2.2); (6.8,3.8); (7.8,3.6); (8.8,2); and (10,2.4).\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/71e838bf549242004a7f1eecfeeb66cde279b324\"><br><br></li>\n<li><img alt=\"Scatter plot with a domain of 0 to 10 and a range of 2 to 6 and the line of best fit going through the points: (0,2.1); (1,3.9); (2.1,3.6); (3.6,3.9); (4.4,4); (5.6,4.2); (6.8,5); (7.8,5); (9,5.6); and (10,6)\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/cbd36cc651fdbd957dfcd9a64989a9f9053ea0a6\"><br></li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Try It: Draw a Best-fit Line for the Plotted Data</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"eventShow\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-content\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\" data-wait-for-event=\"Reveal1\">\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<!--Question  -->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-content\">\n<p>The scatter plots below are the same scatter plot, but each student drew their best fit line differently.

Know that you learn more from wrong answers than from right answers! Wrong answers help us find flaws in our thinking. Take a minute to think about <em>why</em> you got the question wrong.
