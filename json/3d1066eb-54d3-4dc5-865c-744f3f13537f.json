Students also consider (by analyzing an argument) whether modifying the squared term of a quadratic expression in standard form produces the same translation on the graph as modifying the squared term of an expression in vertex form.</p>\n<p>As they modify expressions to translate graphs, students make use of structure. As they analyze an argument about how changing a quadratic expression in standard form affects the graph, they practice explaining their thinking and critiquing the reasoning of others.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Remind students that they have studied the connections between quadratic expressions and their graphs over several lessons. They have matched expressions and graphs and sketched graphs of given expressions. Now they will think about how to change one or more parts of a quadratic expression so that its graph has certain features.</p>\n<p>Before beginning the activity, ask students to describe the graph representing \\(y=x^2\\). Make sure students recall that the graph has a vertex at the origin and opens up. If needed, ask them to name some points that are on the graph, for example, \\((-3,9),(-2,4),(-1,1),(0,0),(1,1),(2,4),(3,9)\\).</p>\n<p>Give students access to graphing technology, but tell students to answer the first question without using technology.</p>\n<p>Consider arranging them in groups of two and encouraging them to discuss the last question with a partner after some quiet think time. If students use a graph to illustrate that Kiran's statement is incorrect, encourage them to also use the expression in their justification.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<ol>\n  <li>How would you change the equation \\(y=x^2\\) so that the vertex of the graph of the new equation is located at the following coordinates and the graph opens as described?</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n  <ol type=\"a\">\n    <li>\\((0,11)\\), opens up </li>\n  </ol>\n</ol>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution </strong>button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(y=x^2+11\\)</p>\n<ol>\n  <ol start=\"2\" type=\"a\">\n    <li> \\((7,11)\\), opens up </li>\n  </ol>\n</ol>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution </strong>button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(y=(x&minus;7)^2+11\\)</p>\n<ol>\n  <ol start=\"3\" type=\"a\">\n    <li>\\((7,-3)\\), opens down </li>\n  </ol>\n</ol>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution </strong>button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(y=-1(x&minus;7)^2&minus;3\\)</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n  <li>Use the graphing tool or technology outside the course.

He changed the equation to \\(y=(x&minus;3)^2+1\\) and saw that the graph shifted 3 units to the right and the vertex is now at \\((3,1)\\).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Next, he graphed the equation \\(y=x^2+2x+1\\) and observed that the vertex is at \\((-1,0)\\). Kiran thought, \"If I change the squared term \\(x^2\\) to \\((x&minus;5)^2\\), the graph will move 5 units to the right and the vertex will be at \\((4,0)\\).\"</p>\n<ol>\n  <ol type=\"a\">\n    <li> Do you agree with Kiran?&nbsp;\n      <ul>\n        <li> Agree </li>\n        <li> Disagree </li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Disagree</p>\n<ol>\n  <ol start=\"2\" type=\"a\">\n    <li> Explain or show your reasoning why you agree or disagree with Kiran. </li>\n  </ol>\n</ol>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution </strong>button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> You should disagree with Kiran.</p>\n<p><img height=\"312\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/a88ae2a71b697616f4636f6f68b0635552210331\" width=\"312\"></p>\n<ul>\n  <li> The vertex of the graph of the original equation \\(y=x^2+2x+1\\) is at \\((-1,0)\\). The vertex of \\(y=(x&minus;5)^2+2x+1\\) is at \\((4,10)\\). </li>\n  <li> Evaluating \\(y=(x&minus;5)^2+2x+1\\) at \\(x = 4\\) gives \\(y=10\\), not \\(y=0\\). </li>\n  <li> The original equation is not in vertex form, so changing \\(x^2\\) into \\((x&minus;5)^2\\) does not change the location of the vertex 5 units to the right. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Select students to share their equations for the first question and their explanations for how they knew what modifications to make.</p>\n<p>Then, focus the discussion on the third question and how students knew that when a quadratic expression is in standard form, adding a constant term before squaring the input variable does not translate the graph the same way as when the expression is in vertex form. At this point, students are not expected to come up with a rigorous justification as to why the graph will not translate as Kiran described. They are only to make this observation and consider ways to explain it.</p>\n<p>Solicit as many explanations as time permits. If no one mentioned that the expression \\(x^2+2x+1\\) is not in vertex form and that its parameters do not relate to the graph the same way, bring these points up.</p>\n<p>If time permits, consider pointing out that in \\(x^2+2x+1\\), the input \\(x\\) shows up in the squared term and the linear term. If we subtract 5 from \\(x\\) before it is squared, but do not subtract 5 from \\(x\\) before it is multiplied by 2, then the graph does not shift horizontally. (If we graph \\((x&minus;5)^2+2(x&minus;5)+1\\), the graph does shift 5 units to the right.) In a later course, students will look more closely at the effects on the graph of replacing \\(f(x)\\) by, for instance, \\(f(x)+k\\) and \\(f(x+k)\\).</p>\n<h3>7.17.2: Self Check&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n        <p>What transformations and shifts need to be made to change \\(y=x^2\\) to \\(y=-(x+5)^2-10\\)?</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>Right 5 and down 10</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incorrect.
