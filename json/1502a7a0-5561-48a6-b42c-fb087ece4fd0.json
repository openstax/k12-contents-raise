To make sure the snacks are nutritious, she can use constraints to represent the upper and lower limits of weight, cost, and nutritional values of the ingredients. She can represent those constraints using inequalities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this section, you will revisit the meaning of the solutions to an inequality in one variable and recall that the solution set is a range of values. You will write and solve inequalities to answer questions about a situation.
