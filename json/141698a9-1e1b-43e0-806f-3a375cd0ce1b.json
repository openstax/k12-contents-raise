They found that the rewriting process was a bit more involved but was not impossible, at least for the problems at hand.</p>\n<p>In this activity, they encounter a real-world example in which they struggle to find a combination of rational factors of \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) that would produce the value of \\(b\\). (Realistic quadratic functions don't always have rational numbers for their zeros, so the quadratic expressions that define them cannot always be written in factored form. At this point, students are not yet considering rational and irrational solutions and are not expected to know why some expressions cannot be easily written in factored form.)</p>\n<p>By graphing the function, students discover that the horizontal intercepts are decimals (rounded to different decimal places, depending on the graphing technology used). The graph allows them to estimate the solution, but that is as far as they could go. The challenges in this activity set the stage for introducing a more productive technique for solving quadratic equations.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Keep students in groups of two. Let students become briefly frustrated by their unsuccessful attempts to find factors of the expression in standard form, but move them on to the last question after a few minutes. Provide access to devices that can run Desmos or other graphing technology.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity </h4>\n<p>An engineer is designing a fountain that shoots out drops of water. The nozzle from which the water is launched is 3 meters above the ground. It shoots out a drop of water at a vertical velocity of 9 meters per second.</p>\n<p>Function \\(h\\) models the height in meters, \\(h\\), of a drop of water \\(t\\) seconds after it is shot out from the nozzle. The function is defined by the equation \\(h(t) = -5t^2+ 9t + 3\\).</p>\n<p>How many seconds until the drop of water hits the ground?</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>Write an equation that we could solve to answer the question.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(-5t^2+ 9t + 3 = 0\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n  <li>Try to solve the equation by writing the expression in factored form and using the zero product property. If it cannot be factored, explain how you came to this conclusion.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> There is no combination of integer factors of the first coefficient, -5, and the third coefficient, 3, that would result in a middle term of 9. Because it is prime, the expression cannot be written in factored form.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\">\n  <li>Solve the equation by graphing the function.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Use the Desmos graphing tool or technology outside the course.</p>\n<p>Explain how you found the solution.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> About 2. The graph shows two horizontal intercepts, one with a positive \\(x\\)-coordinate and one negative \\(x\\)-coordinate. The negative one does not apply here because time in seconds cannot be a negative value. The other horizontal intercept is around \\((2.087,0)\\). This means it takes about 2 seconds for the drop to hit the ground.</p>\n<p><img height=\"400\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/7cd52056b779788ec9c2b1b4f86cf4a673f8f602\" width=\"400\"></p>\n<h4>Using Technology to Find the Rational Factors</h4>\n<p>Watch the following video to learn more about using technology to find the rational factors of a quadratic equation.</p>\n<video controls=\"true\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" width=\"550\">\n  <source src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c4a36219b2c62fa8ffe57f47a507437fcb41b12f\">\n  <track default=\"true\" kind=\"captions\" label=\"On\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/f6efd506061a68e0b17047645681033370565600\" srclang=\"en_us\">https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c4a36219b2c62fa8ffe57f47a507437fcb41b12f\n</video>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Ask students to share some challenges they came across when trying to rewrite the expressions in factored form. Solicit some ideas about why this equation presented those challenges. Then, discuss how they found or estimated the solution by graphing.</p>\n<p>The approximate solution to the equation, given by the zero of the function and the \\(x\\)-intercept of the graph, is 2.087 seconds. Some graphing tools would give an approximation with a longer decimal expansion, giving a clue that it might be trickier to rewrite the equation in factored form. After all, when finding factors, we usually look for integers. (Some quadratic expressions containing non-integer rational numbers can still be written in factored form. For example, \\(x^2 + \\frac {3}{4} + \\frac {1}{8}\\) can be written as \\((x + \\frac {1}{2})(x + \\frac {1}{4})\\).)</p>\n<p>Highlight that some equations are difficult or impossible to rewrite in factored form. In fact, when quadratic models appear in real life, this is usually the case. Graphing is a way to solve these equations, but there are other techniques, which students will learn over the next several lessons.</p>\n<h3>8.10.3: Self Check</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<br>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>\n        <p>A tennis ball is hit by a racket.</p>\n        <p>The function \\(h(t) = -3t^2+ 7t + 3\\) models the height in meters, \\(h\\), of the tennis ball \\(t\\) seconds after the impact with the racket.</p>\n        <p>Use graphing technology to determine the amount of time that has passed from the tennis ball being hit to when it reaches the ground.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>1.167 seconds</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incorrect.
