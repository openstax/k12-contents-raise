Previously, students were given equations and asked to graph them to determine the number of solutions and their values. Here, they are prompted to work the other way around: to write an equation to represent a quadratic function with only one solution. To do so, students need to make use of the structure of the factored form and their knowledge of the zero product property.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Give students access to graphing technology. It can be Desmos or other technology outside the course.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity </h4>\n<p>In previous lessons, we saw that a quadratic equation can have zero, one, or two solutions.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>Sketch graphs that represent three quadratic functions: one that has no zeros, one with one zero, and one with two zeros.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Write down your answers, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answers:</strong><br>\n  No zeros:</p>\n<p><img height=\"262\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/a655a0de355fddfd470e6ea05905772ddb33755f\" width=\"300\"></p>\n<p>One zero:</p>\n<p><img height=\"262\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/34231239a973fd94fc82fc36965512282698e375\" width=\"300\"></p>\n<p>Two zeros:</p>\n<p><img height=\"247\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/a77acf9fb1fd35c6277cd1175717ddf23bb9765b\" width=\"300\"></p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n  <li>Graph the function defined by \\(f(x) = x^2&minus; 2x + 1\\). Examine the \\(x\\)-intercepts of the graph.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Use the Desmos graphing tool or technology outside the course.</p>\n<p>Explain what the \\(x\\)-intercepts reveal about the function.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The graph only intersects the \\(x\\)-axis at one point: \\((1, 0)\\). The function only has one zero.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\">\n  <li>Solve \\(x^2&minus; 2x + 1 = 0\\) by using the factored form and zero product property. What solutions do you get?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Rewrite the standard form to \\((x &minus; 1)(x &minus; 1) = 0\\). The solutions are \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=1\\). Because the two values are the same, we say that this equation has one solution and that \\(x = 1\\) is a double root for the equation.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"4\">\n  <li>Try to find another quadratic function that you think will only have one zero.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Use the Desmos graphing tool or technology outside the course.</p>\n<p>Graph it to check your prediction, then enter your final answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> For example: \\(f(x) = (x + 4)(x + 4)\\). When graphed, this function only has one zero, at \\(x=-4\\).</p>\n<h4>Video: Quadratic Equations with Only One Solution</h4>\n<p>Watch the following video to learn more about writing an equation to represent a quadratic function with only one solution.</p>\n<video controls=\"true\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" width=\"550\">\n  <source src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/889b3c40c743e07be9567fff2ea3696f48b5d53f\">\n  <track default=\"true\" kind=\"captions\" label=\"On\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/90266f9226968002a7e902339132ae24e25c7831\" srclang=\"en_us\">https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/889b3c40c743e07be9567fff2ea3696f48b5d53f\n</video>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Invite students to share how they solved the equation algebraically. Next, invite students to share the equations they generated. Record and display them for all to see.</p>\n<p>Students most likely have written equations in the form of \\(g(x) = (x + m)(x + m)\\). Ask students why the factored form, rather than the standard form, might have been preferred. Highlight that by using the same expression for the two factors, we know that the solution to \\((x + m)(x + m) = 0\\) will be a single number.</p>\n<p>Ask students to describe the graph of a quadratic function with one solution. Point out that this means that the function will have only one zero, and the graph of the function will have a single horizontal intercept.</p>\n<h3>8.9.3: Self Check</h3>\n<em><strong>\n    <p>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</p>\n  </strong></em>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>\n        <p>Without graphing, identify the function whose graph has only one zero.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(f(x) = x^2&minus; 7x &minus; 18\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incorrect.
