They examined this phenomenon and then observed that it will always happen at a large enough input value.</p>\n<p>In this lesson, students investigate how quantities that grow quadratically compare to those that grow exponentially. They discover and reason that increasing exponential functions also eventually surpass increasing quadratic functions. By examining successive quotients for each type of function, students see that the outputs of quadratic functions are not multiplied by the same factor each time the input increases by one. In fact, these successive quotients get smaller as the inputs increase, while the outputs of the exponential function have the same multiplier. As they compare the two types of functions, they develop their understanding of quadratic expressions and how the shape of the graph differs between the two types of functions.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n        Use graphs, tables, and calculations to show that exponential functions eventually overtake quadratic functions.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n        Explain using graphs, tables, or calculations how exponential functions eventually grow faster than quadratic functions.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<colgroup>\n<col>\n<col>\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>A12(B) evaluate functions, expressed in function notation, given one or more elements in their domains.</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n        7.4.1: Comparing Expressions\n    </li>\n<li>\n        7.4.2: Exploring Linear, Exponential, and Quadratic Growth\n    </li>\n<ul>\n<li>\n            7.4.2: Self Check\n        </li>\n<li>\n            7.4.2: Additional Resources\n        </li>\n</ul>\n<li>\n        7.4.3: Comparing Exponential and Quadratic Functions\n    </li>\n<ul>\n<li>\n            7.4.3: Self Check\n        </li>\n<li>\n            7.4.3: Additional Resources\n        </li>\n</ul>\n<li>\n        7.4.4: Comparing Exponential and Quadratic Expressions\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 7.4.5: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n        Graphing technology\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<p>Acquire devices that can run Desmos (recommended) or other graphing technology.
