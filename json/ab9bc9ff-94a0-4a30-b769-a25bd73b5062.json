You practiced adjusting the graphing window until the solution regions become visible and give useful information.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>2.12.2: Solving Problems with Inequalities in Two Variables<ul>\n<li>In this activity, you integrated several ideas and skills from the past few lessons. You wrote inequalities in two variables to represent constraints in situations, used technology to graph the solutions, interpreted points in the solution regions, and used the inequalities and the graphs to answer contextual questions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>2.12.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li>2.12.3: Matching Representations of Inequalities&nbsp;<ul>\n<li>In this activity, you practiced interpreting inequalities in context and reasoning about your solutions graphically and numerically. This sorting and matching task gave you opportunities to analyze representations, statements, and structures closely and to make connections.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>2.12.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li>2.12.4: Graphing Solutions to an Inequality<ul>\n<li>In this activity, you used technology to graph the solutions to your inequality and determined which side of the boundary line to shade.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice:</strong></span><br></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2.12.5: Practice</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Checking In&nbsp;</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<!--Q1-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n<p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<p>Correct!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!----------------- Must be included at the bottom of page for dropdown to work ------------>\n<!--Do not edit below line.-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n</div>"
