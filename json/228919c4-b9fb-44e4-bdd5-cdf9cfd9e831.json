(Note the leading coefficient is 1.)</p>\n<p>We have factored expressions like this before. We know that when the constant term is positive, the signs of the constants in the factored form must be the same.</p>\n<p>Since the middle term is negative, we know that both terms will be negative. So, \\(x^2 &minus; 34x + 64\\) factors into \\((x &minus; 32)(x &minus; 2)\\).</p>\n<p>If the middle term was positive in the expression above, then both constants in the factored form would have been positive.</p>\n<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>\n<p>Now consider the expression \\(x^2&minus; 2x &minus; 24\\). (Note the leading coefficient is 1.)</p>\n<p>The constant term is a negative, &ndash;24. To find its factored form, we are searching for two numbers that have a negative product. This means that these two numbers must have opposite signs since multiplying a positive number and a negative number yields a negative product.</p>\n<p>Now look at the middle term, &ndash;2. We know the sum of these numbers must be &ndash;2. This means the factor with the larger absolute value must be negative.</p>\n<p>Which factors of &ndash;24 have a sum of &ndash;2? The answer is &ndash;6 and 4. Since we know that the larger value must have a negative sign, this confirms the factors we are searching for are &minus;6 and 4.</p>\n<p>This gives a factored form of \\((x &minus; 6)(x + 4)\\).</p>\n<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>\n<p>Find the factored form. (Note the leading coefficient is 1.)</p>\n<p>\\(x^2 + 7x &minus; 18\\)</p>\n<p>The constant term is a negative, &ndash;18. To find its factored form, we are searching for two numbers that have a negative product.</p>\n<p>The middle term is 7. The same two numbers must have a sum of +7.</p>\n<p>Which two numbers have a product of &ndash;18 and a sum of +7?</p>\n<p>The numbers are 9 and &ndash;2.</p>\n<p>So, the factored form is \\((x + 9)(x &minus; 2)\\).</p>\n<h4>Try It: Interpreting Negative Constant Terms When Factoring Quadratic Expressions</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"Reveal1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-content\">\n    <p>Find the factored form of each expression.</p>\n    <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n      <li>\\(x^2+ 7x &minus; 44\\)</li>\n    </ol>\n    <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n      <li>\\(x^2&minus; x &minus; 30\\)</li>\n    </ol>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-prompt\">\n    <p>Write down your answers, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-content\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\" data-wait-for-event=\"Reveal1\">\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n    <li>\\((x + 11)(x &minus; 4)\\)</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>The factors +11 and &ndash;4 yield a product of &ndash;44 (the constant term) and sum to be +7 (the coefficient of the linear term).</p>\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n    <li>\\((x + 5)(x &minus; 6)\\)</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>The factors +5 and &ndash;6 yield a product of &ndash;30 (the constant term) and sum to be &ndash;1 (the coefficient of the linear term).</p>\n</div>"
