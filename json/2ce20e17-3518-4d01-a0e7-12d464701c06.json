For example:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Display the equations from the warm up activity. Ask students if they can tell (without referring to the solutions they found earlier and without solving again) if an equation would have zero, one, or two solutions. </li>\n  <li> Display a mix of equations from the second and third activities. Ask students if they can tell (without referring to the solutions they found earlier) which equations will have two solutions that are opposites (such as 5 and &ndash;5) and which will have two solutions that are not opposites (such as 3 and 7). Ask students to explain their thinking. </li>\n</ul>"
