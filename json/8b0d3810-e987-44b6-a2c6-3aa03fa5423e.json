You will also review how to transform expressions in factored form to standard form, and expressions in vertex form into standard form. You will then experiment with transforming the same expressions in standard form back to vertex form.</p>\n<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> Identify the vertex of the graph of a quadratic function when the expression that defines it is written in vertex form. </li>\n<li> Explain the meaning of the term \"vertex form\" and recognize examples of quadratic expressions written in this form. </li>\n<li> When given a quadratic expression in factored form, rewrite it in standard form. </li>\n<li> When given a quadratic expression in standard form, rewrite it in vertex form. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> 9.8.1: The Vertex and Intercepts of a Function </li>\n<li> 9.8.2: Expanding from Factored Form to Standard Form </li>\n<li> 9.8.3: Converting from Standard Form to Vertex Form\n    <ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> 9.8.3: Self Check </li>\n<li> 9.8.3: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> 9.8.4: Rewriting Expressions in Vertex Form\n    <ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> 9.8.4: Self Check </li>\n<li> 9.8.4: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> 9.8.5: Different Forms of Quadratic Expressions </li>\n<li> 9.8.6: Vertex Form and Coordinates of the Vertex </li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that, you'll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> 9.8.7: Practice </li>\n<li> 9.8.8: Lesson Summary </li>\n</ul>"
