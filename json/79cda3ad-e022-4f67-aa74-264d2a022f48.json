Now they revisit several of these contexts, viewing them as functions and expressing them using function language and notation.</p>\n<p>Each situation involves two quantities, and students will need to choose one of these to be the independent variable and one to be the dependent variable. For all of these relationships, it is possible to choose either variable as the independent, but one choice gives a logarithmic function (which is out of the scope of this course), while the other gives an exponential function. In each case, however, students have previously worked with the context.</p>\n<p>Look for students who explicitly state the meaning of their variables, including units, and invite them to share during the discussion. For example, in the second situation, if \\(t\\) represents the number of years and \\(v\\)<em>&nbsp;</em>represents the value of the car, in dollars, after \\(t\\)<em>&nbsp;</em>years, then \\(v\\)&nbsp;can be viewed as a function \\(f\\) of \\(t\\)&nbsp;where \\(f(t)=18,000(\\frac{2}{3})^t\\). The meaning and units for both \\(t\\)<em>&nbsp;</em>and \\(f(t)\\) (or \\(v\\)) are vital elements to answering the question fully.</p>\n<h4> Launch</h4>\n<p>Tell students that they will now revisit some previously seen situations. Ask students to read the three situations in the task. Then solicit a few ideas on why all of them can be seen as functions.</p>\n<h5> Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n<div>\n  <p>Create a display of important terms and vocabulary. Invite students to brainstorm vocabulary and phrases that they associate with each variable of \\(y=a(b)^x\\). Compile words and phrases that will assist students with setting up equations on a display. This may include labels such as &ldquo;independent variable,&rdquo; &ldquo;dependent variable,&rdquo; &ldquo;multiplier,&rdquo; and &ldquo;starting point,&rdquo; and also specific words explored in previous examples to incorporate prior knowledge. If referencing the moldy bread scenario, the labels of &ldquo;output&rdquo; and &ldquo;input&rdquo; can also be paired with &ldquo;area&rdquo; and &ldquo;time,&rdquo; respectively.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>Here are some situations we have seen previously. For each situation:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Write a sentence of the form &ldquo;_____ is a function of _____.&rdquo;</li>\n  <li> Indicate which is the independent and which is the dependent variable. </li>\n  <li> Write an equation that represents the situation using function notation. </li>\n</ul>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> In a biology lab, a population of 50 bacteria reproduce by splitting.

The day they begin treatment, the area covered by algae is 240 square yards. Each day since the treatment began, a third of the previous day&rsquo;s area (in square yards) remains covered by algae.

The equation gives the area covered by the algae at each time \\(t\\), so a function \\(f\\) can be defined using the same expression: \\(f(t)=240 \\cdot (\\frac{1}{3})^t\\) and \\(A=f(t)\\).</p>\n<h5> Support for English Language Learners</h5>\n<div>\n  <p> Use this routine to support whole-class discussion.
