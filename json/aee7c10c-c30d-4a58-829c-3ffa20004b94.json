As you compare and critique the different models, you construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others. Technology isn&rsquo;t required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for you to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Use exponential functions to model situations that involve exponential growth or decay. </li>\n<li> Determine an appropriate model for a situation described by data. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 5.11.1: Changing the Graphing Window </li>\n<li> 5.11.2: Choosing an Appropriate Model\n    <ul>\n<li> 5.11.2: Self Check&nbsp; </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> 5.11.3: (Optional) Modeling with Exponential Functions </li>\n<li> 5.11.4: Examine Exponential Decay in Context\n    <ul>\n<li> 5.11.4: Self Check&nbsp; </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> 5.11.5: Using Relationship Models to Answer Questions </li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 5.11.6: Practice </li>\n<li> 5.11.7: Lesson Summary </li>\n</ul>"
