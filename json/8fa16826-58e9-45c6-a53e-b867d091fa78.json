How do you know? <br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> More than 1,000. For \\(t=-2\\), \\(5,000\\cdot 2^{-2}=1,250\\).\n  </li>\n  <br>\n  <li> Write the value of the fish population when \\(t=-2\\) in scientific notation. <br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> \\(1.25\\times 10^3\n    \\)\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>\n<h5>Points to emphasize</h5>\n<p>If students struggle to interpret negative exponents, use student work from this cool-down to guide a brief discussion on the topic in a subsequent lesson.</p>"
