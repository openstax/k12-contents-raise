This activity allows students to see that more complicated quadratic equations can also be solved relatively easily when both sides of the equal sign are perfect squares. The work here motivates upcoming lessons on completing the square.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Display the two solutions from the task statement for all to see. Give students a moment to study and make sense of the two methods. Then, ask them to talk to their partner about what Han and Jada did at each step in their solution.</p>\n<p>Next, ask students which method they prefer and why. They are likely to prefer Jada's method since it takes far fewer steps, but some might prefer Han's method because it is more familiar. Tell partners that they will take turns solving equations with each method and get a better feel for each method.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>Han and Jada solved the same quadratic equation with different methods. Here they are:</p>\n<p>Han's method:</p>\n<p>\\(\\begin{aligned}(x-6)^{2} &amp;=25 \\\\ (x-6)(x-6) &amp;=25 \\\\ x^{2}-12 x+36 &amp;=25 \\\\ x^{2}-12 x+11 &amp;=0 \\\\ (x-11)(x-1) &amp;=0 \\\\ (x-11) &amp;=0 \\\\ (x-1) &amp;=0 \\\\ x=11 \\text { or } x &amp;=1 \\end{aligned}\\)</p>\n<p>Jada's method:</p>\n<p>\\(\\begin{aligned}(x-6)^{2} &amp;=25 \\\\ \\sqrt{(x-6)^{2}} &amp;= \\sqrt{25} \\\\ x-6 &amp;=\\pm 5 \\\\ x-6 &amp;=5 \\\\ x-6 &amp;=-5 \\\\ x=11 \\text { or } x &amp;=1\\end {aligned}\\)</p>\n<p>Work with a partner to solve these equations. For each equation, one partner solves with Han's method, and the other partner solves with Jada's method. Make sure both partners get the same solutions to the same equation. If not, work together to find your mistakes.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>\\((y&minus;5)^2=49\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(y=12\\) and \\(y=-2\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n  <li>\\((x+4)^2=9\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=-7\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\">\n  <li>\\((z+ \\frac {1}{3})^2=49\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(z=6.\\overline6\\) or \\(6 \\frac {2}{3}\\) and \\(z=-7.\\overline3\\) or \\(-7\\frac {1}{3}\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"4\">\n  <li>\\((v&minus;0.1)^2= 0.36\\) </li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(v=0.7\\) and \\(v=-0.5\\)</p>\n<h4>Video: Learning About Solving Multi Step Quadratic Equations Using Perfect Squares</h4>\n<p>Watch the following video to learn more about solving multi step quadratic equations using perfect squares.</p>\n<video controls=\"true\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" width=\"550\">\n  <source src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4057a3344a50ef0e5fb6e083a6c1dc0581471249\">\n  <track default=\"true\" kind=\"captions\" label=\"On\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/5363621c968cb6cd2786ceeb90e6cad170cb8f3e\" srclang=\"en_us\">https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4057a3344a50ef0e5fb6e083a6c1dc0581471249\n</video>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>\n<p>Students may need scaffolding beginning with solving equations such as \\(x^2=9\\), which becomes \\(\\sqrt{x^2}=\\sqrt{9}\\) so \\(x=\\pm 3\\). Show students that both solutions \\(x= 3\\) and \\(x =-3\\) work when checked into the original equation. Students have limited experience with the \\(\\pm\\) that is needed and may need further explanation and practice to show that \\(\\sqrt{x^2}\\) will result in two solutions.</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Select students to display their solutions for all to see. Ask students to reflect on the merits of the solution methods. Make sure they recognize that when equations are in perfect squares, they are easier to solve because we can find their square roots.</p>\n<p>Point out that all the equations in this activity already have perfect squares on both sides, but most equations that we need to solve do not. Tell students that in upcoming lessons, they will learn how to transform equations so that they have a perfect square and can be more easily solved.</p>\n<h3>9.1.3: Self Check</h3>\n<em><strong>\n    <p>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</p>\n  </strong></em>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>\n        <p>Find all solutions to \\((x-3)^2=25\\).</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x=8\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incorrect.
