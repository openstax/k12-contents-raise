Are you thinking, &ldquo;\\(x\\) could be four&rdquo;? That&rsquo;s correct, but \\(x\\) could be 6, too, or 37, or even 3.001. Any number greater than 3 is a solution to the inequality \\( x &gt; 3 \\). We show all the solutions to the inequality \\(x &gt; 3\\) on the number line by shading in all the numbers to the right of 3, to show that all numbers greater than 3 are solutions. Because the number 3 itself is not a solution, we put an open dot at 3.</p>\n<p>We can also represent inequalities using interval notation. There is no upper end to the solution to this inequality. In interval notation, we express \\( x &gt; 3 \\) as \\((3, &infin;)\\). The symbol &infin; is read as &ldquo;infinity.&rdquo; It is not an actual number.</p>\n<p>The figure below shows both the number line and the interval notation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\\( x &gt; 3 \\)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"A number line is shown.

The left bracket symbol, [, shows that the endpoint is included.</p>\n<p>The inequality \\(x&le;1\\) means all numbers less than or equal to 1. Here we need to show that 1 is a solution, too. We do that by putting a bracket at \\(x = 1\\). We then shade in all the numbers to the left of 1, to show that all numbers less than 1 are solutions.
