Explain why, if&nbsp;<span>\\( x \\)</span>&nbsp;is a number that makes the first equation true, then it also makes the second equation true.</li>\n<li>Choose a pair of equations from column B. Explain why the second equation is no longer true for a value of&nbsp;<span>\\( x \\)</span>&nbsp;that makes the first equation true.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, switch roles until you run out of time or you run out of pairs of equations.</p>\n<p>Some principles you might use to complete this activity include the following:</p>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Distributive Property</li>\n<li>Addition Property of Equality</li>\n<li>Additive Inverse</li>\n<li>Subtraction Property of Equality</li>\n<li>Multiplication Property of Equality</li>\n<li>Division Property of Equality</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<div>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\"></th>\n<th scope=\"col\">A</th>\n<th scope=\"col\">B</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\">1.</th>\n<td><span>\\( 16=4(9-x) \\)</span><br><span>\\( 16=36-4x \\)</span></td>\n<td><span>\\( 9x = 5x + 4 \\)</span><br><span>\\( 14x = 4 \\)</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\">2.</th>\n<td><span>\\( 5x = 24 + 2x \\)</span><br><span>\\( 3x = 24 \\)</span></td>\n<td><span>\\( \\frac12x - 8 = 9 \\)</span><br><span>\\( x - 8 = 18 \\)</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\">3.</th>\n<td><span>\\( -3(2x +9)=12 \\)</span><br><span>\\( 2x+9=-4 \\)</span></td>\n<td><span>\\( 6x - 6 = 3x \\)</span><br><span>\\( x - 1 = 3x \\)</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\">4.</th>\n<td><span>\\( 5x=3-x \\)</span><br><span>\\( 5x = -x + 3 \\)</span></td>\n<td><span>\\( -11(x -2) = 8 \\)</span><br><span>\\( x-2 = 8 + 11 \\)</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\">5.</th>\n<td><span>\\( 18 = 3x - 6 + x \\)</span><br><span>\\( 18 = 4x - 6 \\)</span></td>\n<td><span>\\( 4 - 5x = 24 \\)</span><br><span>\\( 5x = 20 \\)</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><br>\n</div>\n<div>After you have discussed these equations with your partner, select the <strong>Sample Responses</strong> button to check your reasoning.<br></div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta\" data-button-text=\"Sample Responses\" data-fire-event=\"eventShow1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-content\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-prompt\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-content\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\" data-wait-for-event=\"eventShow1\">\n<p id=\"fs-id1168345252532\">Here is how to check the solution to the equation in two variables.</p>Check your reasoning for the equations you discussed.<div class=\"os-raise-ib-content\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\" data-wait-for-event=\"eventShow1\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"os-raise-ib-content\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\" data-wait-for-event=\"eventShow1\">Column A: Sample response:</div><div class=\"os-raise-ib-content\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\" data-wait-for-event=\"eventShow1\"><ol><li>By the distributive property, \\( 4(9&minus;x) \\) is equal to \\(&nbsp;36&minus;4x&nbsp;\\) for any value of \\(&nbsp;x\\).
