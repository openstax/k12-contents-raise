By finding the factors of the \\(c\\) term and checking to see if they add up to the \\(b\\) term, you are able to find the factors of a trinomial of this form. </li>\n      <li> 6.5.2: Self Check</li>\n      <li>6.5.2: Additional Resources</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li> 6.5.3: Factoring Trinomials Using Trial and Error\n    <ul>\n      <li> In this activity, you learned that you sometimes need to factor out the GCF from a trinomial as the first step to factoring. You also learned some tricks to help determine the factors of a trinomial, such as when the middle term is negative and the last term is positive, the signs in the binomial factors must both be negative. You practiced finding the factors of a trinomial of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) using a trial and error method. </li>\n      <li> 6.5.3: Self Check</li>\n      <li>6.5.3: Additional Resources</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li> 6.5.4: Factoring Trinomials Using the &ldquo;\\(ac\\)&rdquo; Method and Substitution\n    <ul>\n      <li> In this activity, you learned a method that can be used to factor any trinomial, the &ldquo;\\(ac\\)&rdquo; method. By finding two numbers that multiply to \\(ac\\) and add to \\(b\\), you can factor the trinomial by grouping. You also learned a substitution method that allows you to factor trinomials that do not appear to fit into the \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) form at first. </li>\n      <li> 6.5.4: Self Check</li>\n      <li>6.5.4: Additional Resources</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li> 6.5.5: Choosing Your Own Method to Factor Trinomials </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> In this activity, you combined everything you learned in the lesson to choose your own preferred method to factor a trinomial.</li>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following<strong> practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 6.5.6: Practice </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-content-id=\"5d606f6b-ff4a-4bf5-81d5-f5a17d5214dc\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <!--pulldown-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-content-id=\"0968dd57-136d-45f7-9a9d-b0ef26373b65\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n      <p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n      <p>Correct!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n      <p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!--Do not edit below line.-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n</div>"
