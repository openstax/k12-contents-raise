In making comparisons, students have a reason to use language precisely. The activity also enables the teacher to hear the terminology students know and learn how they talk about characteristics of graphs.</p>\n  <p>The work here prepares students to reason about solutions to equations by graphing, which is the focus of this lesson.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Launch</h3>\n<div class=\"body\">\n  <p>Arrange students in groups of 2&ndash;4. Display the graphs for all to see.</p>\n  <p>Give students 1 minute of quiet think time and then time to share their thinking with their small group. In their small groups, ask each student to share their reasoning as to why a particular graph does not belong, and together find at least one reason each item doesn&rsquo;t belong.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>\n<div class=\"body\">\n  <p>Which one doesn&rsquo;t belong?</p>\n  <div class=\"imgrid\">\n    <div class=\"g--row g--row-1\">\n      <div class=\"g--col-1 g--column g--content g--one-fourth g--row-1\">\n        <div>\n          <span class=\"embedded-image-caption\"></span>\n          <p>A</p>\n          <img alt=\"A line graphed on a set of axes, origin O.

Record and display the responses for all to see. After each response, ask the class if they agree or disagree. Since there is no single correct answer to the question of which one does not belong, attend to students&rsquo; explanations and ensure the reasons given are correct.</p>\n  <p>During the discussion, ask students to explain the meaning of any terminology they use, such as &ldquo;<span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( y \\)</span>-intercept&rdquo; or &ldquo;negative slope.&rdquo; Also, press students on unsubstantiated claims. (For example, if a student claims that graph A is the only one with a slope greater than 1, ask them to explain or show how they know.)</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<div>\n  <div class=\"main\">\n    <div class=\"student-summary\">\n      <div class=\"body\">\n        <ul>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>"
