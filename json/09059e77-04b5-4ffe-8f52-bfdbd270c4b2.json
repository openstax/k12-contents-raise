Making comparisons prompted you to think about the solutions to the equations, inequalities, or systems that were represented. It also gave you an opportunity to use language precisely.\n        </li>\n</ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n        2.14.2: Determining if Points on Boundary Lines Are Solutions to a System\n    </li>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\">\n            In this activity, you took a closer look at whether points that are on the boundary lines are solutions to the system.\n        </li>\n</ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n        2.14.2: Self Check\n    </li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n        2.14.3: Solving Problems to Satisfy Multiple Constraints Simultaneously\n    </li>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\">\n            In this activity, you had an opportunity to use your understanding of systems of linear inequalities to solve problems that involve satisfying multiple constraints simultaneously.\n        </li>\n</ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n        2.14.3: Self Check</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n        2.14.4: Identifying Graph Regions Included in a System&rsquo;s Solution\n    </li>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\">\n            In this activity, you determined all the inequalities that represent a given situation and shaded regions and adjusted line types to represent solutions.&nbsp;\n        </li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n        2.14.5: Practice\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In&nbsp;</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<!--Q1-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n<p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<p>Correct!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!----------------- Must be included at the bottom of page for dropdown to work ------------>\n<!--Do not edit below line.-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n</div>"
