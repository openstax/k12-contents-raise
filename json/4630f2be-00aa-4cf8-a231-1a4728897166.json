There are many possible responses to the question. Given their current work on exponential functions, students might be inclined to wonder if the equations define exponential functions, to look for a growth factor, or to think about the initial value of the function.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>Which one doesn&rsquo;t belong?</p>\n<p>\\(f(n)=8 \\cdot 2^n\\)</p>\n<p><strong>Answer: </strong>\\(f\\) is the only one that doubles when \\(n\\) increases by 1.</p>\n<p>\\(g(n)=2 \\cdot 8^n\\)</p>\n<p><strong>Answer: </strong>\\(g\\)<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is the only one that does not have 8 for its vertical intercept.</p>\n<p>\\(h(n)=8+2n\\)</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;\\(h\\) is the only one that is not an exponential function.</p>\n<p>\\(j(n)=8 \\cdot (\\frac{1}{2})^n\\)</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;\\(j\\) is the only one that is not increasing.</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Invite students to share their responses. Highlight ideas that are important to this unit, for example, how the vertical intercept for each function can be identified, that \\(j\\) is a function involving exponential decay, etc. Encourage precision in students&rsquo; mathematical language, for instance, by reinforcing the use of terms such as <em>exponential</em>, <em>growth factor</em>, <em>initial amount</em>, <em>base</em>, <em>exponent</em>, <em>linear</em>, etc.</p>"
