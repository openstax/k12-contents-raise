We can plot these solutions in the rectangular coordinate system. The points will line up perfectly in a straight line. We connect the points with a straight line to get the graph of the equation. We put arrows on the ends of each side of the line to indicate that the line continues in both directions.</p>\n<p>A graph is a visual representation of all the solutions of the equation. It is an example of the saying, &ldquo;A picture is worth a thousand words.&rdquo; The line shows you all the solutions to that equation. Every point on the line is a solution of the equation. And, every solution of this equation is on this line. This line is called the graph of the equation. Points not on the line are not solutions!</p>\n<p>The graph of a linear equation \\(Ax + By = C\\) is a straight line.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every point on the line is a solution of the equation.</li>\n<li>Every solution of this equation is a point on this line.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"\" id=\"fs-id1167834377117\">The graph of \\(y = 2x &minus; 3\\) is shown.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"This figure shows a straight line graphed on the x y-coordinate plane.
