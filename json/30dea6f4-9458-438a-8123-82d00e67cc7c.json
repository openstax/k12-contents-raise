The solution to a system of two linear inequalities is a region that contains the solutions to both inequalities. To find this region, we will graph each inequality separately and then locate the region where they are both true. The solution is always shown as a graph.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Example</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Solve the system by graphing:&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\\(\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}y\\geq2x-1\\\\y&lt;x+1\\end{array}\\right.\\)</p>\n<h5>Solution</h5>\n<p></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td valign=\"top\" width=\"208\">\n        <p><b>Step 1.</b>&nbsp;Graph the first inequality.</p>\n        <p></p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Graph the boundary line.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p></p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n        <p></p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Shade in the side of the boundary line where the inequality is true.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p></p>\n      </td>\n      <td valign=\"top\" width=\"208\">\n        <p>We will graph \\(y\\geq2x-1\\)</p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n        <p>We graph the line \\(y=2x-1.\\) It is a solid line because the inequality sign is \\(\\ geq\\).</p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n        <p>We choose \\(0,0)\\) as a test point.
