Here they investigate the movement of free-falling objects. Students analyze the vertical distances that falling objects travel over time and see that they can be described by quadratic functions. They use tables, graphs, and equations to represent and make sense of the functions. In subsequent lessons, students build on the functions developed here to represent projectile motions, providing a context to develop understanding of the zeros, vertex, and domain of quadratic functions.</p>\n<p>To express the relationship between distance and time, students need to see regularity in numerical values and express that regularity.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Explain (orally and in writing) the meaning of each term in a quadratic expression that represents the height of a free-falling object. </li>\n<li> Use tables, graphs, and equations to represent the height of a free-falling object. </li>\n<li> Write quadratic functions to represent the height of an object falling due to gravity. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li> Explain the meaning of the terms in a quadratic expression that represents the height of a falling object. </li>\n<li> Use tables, graphs, and equations to represent the height of a falling object. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<colgroup>\n<col>\n<col>\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><p><strong>TEKS</strong></p></td>\n<td><p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><p>A7(A) graph quadratic functions on the coordinate plane and use the graph to identify key attributes, if possible, including \\(x\\)-intercept, \\(y\\)-intercept, zeros, maximum value, minimum values, vertex, and the equation of the axis of symmetry.</p></td>\n<td><p>Foundational: Lesson provides foundational content necessary for students to be able to perform this TEKS in later lessons.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 7.5.1: Numerical Patterns </li>\n<li> 7.5.2: A Time-Distance Quadratic Model </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 7.5.2: Self Check </li>\n<li> 7.5.2: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 7.5.3: Distance as a Quadratic Function of Elapsed Time </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 7.5.3: Self Check </li>\n<li> 7.5.3: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 7.5.4: A Quadratic Expression that Represents the Relationship Between Distance and Time </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 7.5.5: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<p>None</p>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<p>Be prepared to display a GeoGebra applet for all to see during the synthesis of the activity &ldquo;Distance as a Quadratic Function of Elapsed Time.&rdquo;</p>\n<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson. Encourage students to look for these words and notice their use and meanings. </li>\n<li> Encourage students to use key vocabulary words in &ldquo;math talk&rdquo; and their written and oral explanations. </li>\n<li> Utilize a word wall.
