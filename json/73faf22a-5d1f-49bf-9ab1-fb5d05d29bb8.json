In this activity, they shift to reasoning symbolically and abstractly about linear equations in two variables.</p>\n<p>Students are prompted to match equations in standard forms to pairs of slopes and <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( y \\)</span>-intercepts. They could go about making the matches in various ways. Here are a few likely strategies, from less reliant on structure to more reliant on structure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Substituting the coordinates of the given <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( y \\)</span>-intercepts into each equation and seeing which one produces true equations.</li>\n<li>Calculating the <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( y \\)</span>-values when <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( x \\)</span> is 0 and <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( x \\)</span> is 1. The former gives the <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( y \\)</span>-intercept. Subtracting the latter from the former gives the slope.</li>\n<li>Graphing each equation (either by hand or using technology) and analyzing the graph.</li>\n<li>Rearranging the equation into slope-intercept form, <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( y=mx+b \\)</span>, and identifying the <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( m \\)</span> and <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( b \\)</span>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Others may notice that when isolating \\(y\\) in an equation in standard form, the constant term in the resulting equation is&nbsp;\\( \\frac{c}{b} \\) and the coefficient of \\( x \\) is \\( \\frac{-A}{B} \\), and that these values tell them the vertical intercept and the slope. In addition to making use of structure, students who make and apply these observations also practice expressing regularity through repeated reasoning.</p>\n<p>Making graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically.</p>\n<p>As students work, monitor the strategies they use. Encourage those who approach the task by substituting values into the equations to consider rearranging equations or otherwise using the structure of the equations.</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<p>Keep students in groups of 2. Consider asking students to take turns finding a match and explaining their strategy to their partner. </p>\n<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>\n<div>\n<p><em>Conversing: MLR8 Discussion Supports.&nbsp;</em>Arrange students in groups of 2. Students should take turns finding a match and explaining their reasoning to their partner. Display the following sentence frames for all to see: &ldquo;_____ and _____ match because . . .&rdquo; and &ldquo;I noticed _____ , so I matched . . .&rdquo; Encourage students to challenge each other when they disagree.<br><em>Design Principle(s): Support sense-making; Maximize meta-awareness</em><em></em></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"c-annotation c-annotation--swd\"><em><br></em></div>\n</div>\n<h4>Support for Students with Disabilities</h4>\n<div>\n<p><em>Action and Expression: Internalize Executive Functions.</em>&nbsp;Chunk this task into more manageable parts to differentiate the degree of difficulty or complexity. Some students may benefit by starting with a subset of the equations to match. Check in with students within the first 2&ndash;3 minutes of work time to ensure that they have a strategy to find a match.

Common mistakes here include isolating <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( x \\)</span> rather than <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( y \\)</span>, changing the sign of only one term when dividing by a negative number, and dividing only one of two terms by the coefficient of <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( y \\)</span>. (For these last two mistakes, remind students of the work in the Warm-up.)</p>\n<p>Students who recognize that the slope of a line with equation <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( Ax+By=C \\)</span> is <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( \\frac{- A}{B} \\)</span> and that the <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( y \\)</span>-intercept is <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( \\frac{C}{B} \\)&nbsp;</span>may also write the wrong signs or get a ratio reversed. Students who use this strategy are likely shortcutting the process of isolating <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( y \\)</span>. Asking them to isolate <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( y \\)</span> for one equation can help them identify errors.</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<p>Select students to present their strategies. Sequence the order of presentation as listed in the Activity Narrative. After each strategy is presented, ask if other students approached it the same way and consider discussing questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&ldquo;How would you describe the matching process or the strategy? Was it fairly efficient or laborious? Was it prone to errors?&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;If the list of slopes and <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( y \\)</span>-intercepts were not available for you to choose from, would you still be able to determine the slope and <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( y \\)</span>-intercept?&rdquo; (Yes, except those who rely on the first strategy, using the coordinate values of each <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( y \\)</span>-intercept on the list to test the equations.)</li>\n<li>(For students who use graphing technology) &ldquo;Would you still use graphs to make the matches if the graphing needed to be done by hand?&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Highlight that it is helpful and efficient to use the structure of an equation to get insights about the properties of its graph. At this stage, it is not essential that students recognize that the slope of an equation of the form <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( Ax+By=C \\)</span> is <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( \\frac{- A}{B} \\)</span> and that it crosses the <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( y \\)</span>-axis at <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( \\frac{C}{B} \\)</span>. Students should, however, recognize that solving for <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( y \\)</span> involves a predictable process and the resulting equation makes the slope and <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( y \\)</span>-intercept visible</p>\n</div>\n<h4>1.11.3: Self Check&nbsp;</h4>\n<p><strong><em>Following the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>QUESTION:</strong><br>What is the slope of the line \\( 4x + 3y = 12 \\)?<br></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Answers</td>\n<td>Feedback</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\\( -\\frac{4}{3} \\)</td>\n<td>That&rsquo;s correct!
