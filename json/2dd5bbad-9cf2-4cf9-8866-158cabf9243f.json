Each video highlights key concepts and vocabulary that students learn across one or more lessons in the unit. The content of these video lesson summaries is based on the written Lesson Summaries found at the end of lessons in the curriculum. The goal of these videos is to support students in reviewing and checking their understanding of important concepts and vocabulary. Here are some possible ways families can use these videos:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Keep informed on concepts and vocabulary students are learning about in class.</li>\n<li>Watch with their students and pause at key points to predict what comes next or think up other examples of vocabulary terms.</li>\n<li>Consider following the Connecting to Other Units links to review the math concepts that led up to this unit or to preview where the concepts in this unit lead to in future units.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<div align=\"left\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"299\">\n<col width=\"157\">\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unit 3: Two-Variable Statistics</p>\n</th>\n<th>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Vimeo</p>\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Video 3.1: Scatter Plots (Lessons 3.1&ndash;1.3)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Video VLS Alg1U3V2 Scatter Plots (Lessons 4&ndash;6) available at <a href=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/463695012\">https://player.vimeo.com/video/463695012 target=\"_blank\"</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Video 3.2: Correlation Coefficient (Lessons 3.4&ndash;3.6)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Video VLS Alg1U3V3 Correlation Coefficients (Lessons 7&ndash;9) available at <a href=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/466358466\">https://player.vimeo.com/video/466358466 target=\"_blank\"</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><strong><br></strong><br>\n"
