This built a foundation for understanding how to find the factored forms of different quadratic expressions. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 8.7.2: Interpreting Negative Constant Terms When Factoring Quadratic Expressions </li>\n  <ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n    <li> In this activity, you learned how to find the factored form of a quadratic expression that has a negative constant term. </li>\n    <li> 8.7.2: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 8.7.2: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 8.7.3: Analyzing Factors of 100 and &ndash;100 </li>\n  <ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n    <li> In this activity, you continued exploring how to find the factored form of a quadratic expression with a negative constant term. You learned to distinguish the signs of the factors based on the middle, or linear, term in the quadratic expression. </li>\n    <li> 8.7.3: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 8.7.3: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 8.7.4: Finding the Missing Terms </li>\n  <ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n    <li> In this activity, you combined all of the skills learned in the lesson to identify missing signs in conversions from quadratic expressions in standard form to factored form. </li>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> 8.7.5: Practice </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-content-id=\"24ea1a84-c3e6-4218-ba07-16c6bd7c2cd7\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <!--pulldown-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-content-id=\"e88d00a1-5466-4c50-b0b6-cba5c86e9423\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n      <p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n      <p>Correct!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n      <p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!--Do not edit below line.-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n</div>"
