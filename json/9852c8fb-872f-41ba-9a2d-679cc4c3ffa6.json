Monitor for students who</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> find it useful to reason with a diagram, such as a rectangular diagram</li>\n  <li> transfer what they learned when multiplying two sums in the preceding lesson&mdash;that \\((x+p)(x+q)\\) is equivalent to \\(x^2+(p+q)x+pq\\)<strong>&mdash;</strong>and use negative numbers for \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Either approach is welcome, but it is important to transition students from using rectangular diagrams as a way to organize the terms of the factors to directly applying the distributive property to multiply binomials.</p>\n<p>Students see that \\((x-1)(x-1)\\) can be expressed as \\((x+-1)(x+-1)\\), so the sides of the diagram can be labeled accordingly. The negative values in the expressions are not problematic when the expressions do not represent side lengths of a rectangle and the partial products don&rsquo;t represent areas.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Remind students we have used area diagrams to expand expressions such as \\(x(x+5)\\) and write equivalent expressions. When dealing with negative numbers, however, thinking in terms of finding area isn&rsquo;t very helpful. Explain that we can still draw rectangular diagrams, but use them to organize the two factors and the results of applying the distributive property. Note that in Unit 6, students learned how to multiply binomial expressions and square a binomial. They may choose to show that expressions are equivalent algebraically, through strategies like FOIL, rather than by drawing a diagram.</p>\n<p>For example, this diagram shows that \\(x(x+5)=x^2+5x\\)</p>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"39\">\n    <col width=\"39\">\n    <col width=\"39\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>&nbsp;</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>\\(x\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>\\(5\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>\\(x\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>\\(x^2\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>\\(5x\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p>Explain that such diagrams can be used even when subtraction is involved.

Remind them that just as \\(x^2\\) means \\(x \\cdot x\\), the expression \\((x-2)^2\\) means \\((x-2)(x-2)\\).</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li> Select students with contrasting strategies to share their work. Display those that used a diagram first and make connections to those that did not use a diagram. </li>\n  <li> Emphasize that we can view \\(x-1\\) as \\(x+-1\\), and the expression \\((x-1)(x-1)\\) as two sums: \\((x+-1)(x+-1)\\). Likewise, the expression \\((x+3)(x-2)\\) can be viewed as two sums: \\((x+3)(x+-2)\\). We can then draw diagrams (as shown in the Answers) to organize the terms of the factors. We can also apply the distributive property and distribute the multiplication of each term in one factor to each term in the other factor. Display and explain the following reasoning to students: </li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt='Equivalent expressions by using the Distributive Property.\" class=\"h-max-height--15-lines\" height=\"530' height=\"200\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/f6c930f215779b5fa49723ccfc6080054529290c\" width=\"200\"></p>\n<p>Time permitting, consider helping students to generalize their work. Remind them that, in an earlier lesson, we saw that a quadratic expression of the form \\((x+p)(x+q)\\) is equivalent to: \\(x^2+px+qx+pq\\) or \\(x^2+(p+q)x+pq\\).</p>\n<p>Ask students:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> &ldquo;Is the expanded expression still equivalent to the factored expression when \\(p\\) or \\(q\\) is negative? (Yes, because we can rewrite \\((x-p)\\) or \\((x-q)\\) as a sum.) Can you use the examples from the activity to show that it still is or is not?&rdquo; </li>\n  <li> &ldquo;What about when both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are negative? (Yes. Both differences can be rewritten as a sum.) Can you use the examples from the activity to support your answer?&rdquo; </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>7.9.2: Self Check</h3>\n<em><strong>\n    <p>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</p>\n  </strong></em> <br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>\n        <p>Which of the following expressions is equivalent to \\((x-2)^2\\)?</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x^2-4\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incorrect.
