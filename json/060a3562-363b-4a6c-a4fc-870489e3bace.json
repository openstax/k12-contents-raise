Record your matches and be prepared to explain your reasoning.</p>\n<p>Use the cards to answer questions 1&ndash;4. Match each graph representation to the description of the situation characterized by exponential change. Then choose the relationship between the number of years since purchase and the value.</p>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Check\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"3\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <!--Q#-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"multiplechoice\" data-solution=\"A car loses \\(\\frac14\\) of its value every year after purchase.\" data-solution-options='[\"The value of a stock doubles approximately every 4 years.\", \"A car loses \\\\(\\\\frac14\\\\) of its value every year after purchase.\", \"The value of a stock triples roughly every 8 years.\", \"A laptop loses \\\\(\\\\frac25\\\\) of its value every year after purchase.\"]'>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n      <ol>\n        <li><img alt height=\"283\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/9bbfaea14fa34c45968c0ce2f4841e93c52b7ff8\" width=\"300\"><br>\n          Choose the description of exponential change shown in the graph.</li>\n      </ol>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n      <p>Correct!
