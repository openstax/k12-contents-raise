It also provides practice deriving the solutions, or zeros, of a function from its factored form.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Students will use graphing technology to analyze the graph of a quadratic function by finding the \\(x\\)-intercepts and zeros.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Ask students to work through the questions individually, but ask their partner if they have a question.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>Write the quadratic function \\(f(x) = x^2 &minus; 9x + 20\\) in factored form.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(f(x) = (x &minus; 4)(x &minus; 5)\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n  <li>What are the solutions of the quadratic equation \\((x &minus; 4)(x &minus; 5) = 0\\)?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(x = 4\\) and \\(x = 5\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\">\n  <li>Graph the quadratic function \\(f(x) = x^2&minus; 9x + 20\\).&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Use the Desmos graphing tool or technology outside the course.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What are the \\(x\\)-intercepts of the graph?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\((4, 0)\\), \\((5, 0)\\) or 4 and 5</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"4\">\n  <li>Marcus states that the zeros of the function of \\(f(x) = x^2 &minus; 9x + 20\\) are 4 and 5. Do you agree? Explain your reasoning.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, 4 and 5 are the input values that result in an output of 0. When the function \\(f(x) = x^2 &minus; 9x + 20\\) is graphed, it crosses the \\(x\\)-axis at \\(x=4\\) and \\(x=5\\).</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Ensure students understand moving from standard form to factored form to deriving solutions or zeros using a quadratic function. After students work through the questions, ask the class as a whole if there are any outstanding questions.</p>\n<p>These are important skills that this lesson builds on as students learn more about writing a quadratic function when given its zeros.</p>"
