Her pay would be $109.80, and after subtracting $7.15 for the bus fare, she would still earn $102.65. She would earn $99 from the other option.</p>\n    <p>Jada should help her neighbors. Working 9 hours at the bookstore would mean a few dollars more than working 9 hours helping her neighbors, but it would also mean losing some personal time because of the travel involved.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>"
