Here students will need to know how to restrict the domain of the graph produced using the technology available to them. If students are not already familiar with how to do so, demonstrate how to do so with a simple quadratic function, for example: \\(y=x^2\\), where the domain is \\(-2 \\leq x \\leq 2\\).</p>\n<p>The activity is unlike the ones students have seen before and requires students to transfer and apply their understanding in new ways. It is a chance for students to make sense of a problem and persevere in solving it .</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Provide access to devices that can run Desmos or other graphing technology.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p><img height=\"204\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/2d08f05ca71c6c6b4e778d6008e158525cddb397\" width=\"254\"></p>\n<p>Do you see two \"eyes\" and a smiling \"mouth\" on the graph?
