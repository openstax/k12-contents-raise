This discussion helped you develop fluency and helped prepare you to compute residuals from a linear model.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>3.3.2: Plotting and Analyzing Residuals<ul>\n      <li>In this activity, you explored the concept of residuals, plotted residuals, and analyzed the residuals to informally assess the fit of a function. In this activity, you also fitted a function to data and used the function to solve problems. You learned that a residual is the difference between the actual \\(y\\)-value for a point and the expected \\(y\\)-value for the point on the linear model with the same associated \\(x\\)-value.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>3.3.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>3.3.3: Matching Residuals Graphs to Scatter Plots<ul>\n      <li>In this activity, you took turns with a partner, matching graphs of residuals to scatter plots that displayed linear models. You explained your thinking and listened in order to explain your reasoning and critique the reasoning of others. You recognized that a plot of the residuals for data that are fit well by a linear model shows residuals that are close to the \\(x\\)-axis and do not show a noticeable pattern.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>3.3.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>3.3.4: Identifying Best Fit Line for Residuals on a Graph<ul>\n      <li>In this activity, you identified a graph most likely to represent the residuals from the best fit line.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>3.3.5: Practice</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In&nbsp;</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <!--Q1-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n      <p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n      <p>Correct!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n      <p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!----------------- Must be included at the bottom of page for dropdown to work ------------>\n  <!--Do not edit below line.-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n</div>"
