Arithmetic sequences are characterized by adding a constant value to get from one term to the following term, just as linear functions are characterized by a constant rate of change.</p>\n<p>Building from their thinking about geometric sequences, students begin this lesson comparing three different sequences. By articulating how the sequences are alike and different, they demonstrate the need for precise language (TEKS A1(G)). Next, students consider two arguments for what type of sequence is represented in a table, and then they use a graph of the sequence to justify why it could be arithmetic. Throughout the lesson, students will work with and create different representations of functions.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Compare and contrast (orally and in writing) arithmetic and geometric sequences.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Determine the rate of change of an arithmetic sequence.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Interpret tables and graphs to determine if a sequence is arithmetic or geometric.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Explain what it means for a sequence to be arithmetic or geometric.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>A12(C)<u> identify terms of arithmetic and geometric sequences when the sequences are given in function form</u> using recursive processes;</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Partial coverage: Lesson provides content that covers part of this TEKS.
