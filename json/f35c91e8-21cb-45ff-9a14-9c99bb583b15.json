Be prepared to explain your reasoning.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(x=\\frac {5}{2}\\) (or 2.5) and \\(x=1\\). Rewriting the expression in factored form gives \\((2x &minus; 5)(x &minus; 1) = 0\\). Using the zero product property: \\(2x &minus; 5 = 0\\) or \\(x &minus; 1 = 0\\), so \\(x=\\frac {5}{2}\\) and \\(x = 1\\).</p>\n<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>\n<h5>Points to Emphasize</h5>\n<p>If students struggle with factoring and don't solve the equation using another method (such as graphing), this is an excellent opportunity to highlight that factoring is not always the most efficient path to a solution (and is not always a possible path to a solution). Highlight different approaches to solving this problem in a subsequent lesson. If your state standards emphasize solving quadratic equations with leading coefficients greater than 1, revisit this problem in a subsequent lesson and assign additional practice problems for review of this topic.</p>"
