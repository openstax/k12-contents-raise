Ask students to identify the connections between the quantities in a situation and the graph and expressions that represent it. Use an example from a classroom activity or a new example like this:</p>\n<p>\\(1000\\cdot 2^t\\) represents a fish population after \\(t\\) years. Here is the graph of the yearly fish population. Display for all to see, and ask students where they can see the 1,000 and the 2 in the graph.</p>\n<p><img height=\"286\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/im-ims-export/8LyEWsCJpAgAv4MeuseNit44\" width=\"300\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li> What was the fish population when the scientists first measured it? (1,000) </li>\n<li> How can you tell from the graph? (It is the vertical intercept, the number of fish when \\(t=0\\).) </li>\n<li> How is the fish population changing from year to year? (It&rsquo;s doubling.) </li>\n<li> How does the expression \\(1000\\cdot 2^t\\) represent the fish population after \\(t\\) years? (The 1,000 is the starting population. Every year it doubles, so we multiply 1,000 by 2, \\(t\\) times.) </li>\n</ul>"
