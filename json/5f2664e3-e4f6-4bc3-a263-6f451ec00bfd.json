They also recalled that a linear equation in two variables has many solutions, which are represented by all the points on the graph of the equation. The work in this activity builds on those understandings.</p>\n<p>Students see that the solutions to a linear inequality in two variables can be represented by many points on a coordinate plane, and that the set of points are in a region bounded by a line. To represent the set of all points that are solutions, we can shade that region. Students also see that the points that fall on the other side of the boundary line are not solutions to the inequality.</p>\n<p>During the activity, students are not yet expected to recognize that the line is the graph of an equation related to the inequality (although some students may notice that). That insight is made explicit in the synthesis and reinforced in the next activity.</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<div>\n<p>Display the inequality \\( 2x+3y \\le 12 \\) for all to see, along with a blank coordinate grid.</p>\n<div><img alt=\"Blank x y coordinate plane with grid and origin labeled O.

On the coordinate plane, mark each point that is a solution with a dot and each point that is not a solution with an X (or use different colors to mark the points).</span></div>\n<div><span><br></span></div>\n<div><span>Then, ask each student to identify 3 coordinate pairs that are solutions and 3 pairs that are not solutions to the inequality.

If they suggest that the invisible line might be the graph of\\( 2x+3y=12 \\), that's great, but it is unnecessary to point this out otherwise.</span><span>Arrange students in groups of 3-4. Tell students that their job in this activity is to plot some points that do and do not represent solutions to a few inequalities. If time is limited, consider assigning 1-2 inequalities to each group.<br><br></span></div>\n<h4>Support for Students with Disabilities</h4>\n<div>\n<p><em></em><em>Action and Expression: Provide Access for Physical Action.</em>Eliminate computational barriers so that students may focus on more efficiently plotting points and noticing patterns.

Either use two different colors or two different symbols like X and O.</li>\n<li>Plot enough points until you start to see the region that contains solutions and the region that contains non-solutions.

(A document camera would be very helpful, if available.) In particular, look for examples where a student decided to \"shade\" all the points on one side of the boundary line.</p>\n<p>Invite students to make some observations about the graphs. Discuss questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"What do the two sets of points represent?\" (Solutions and non-solutions to the inequalities)</li>\n<li>\"If we plot a new point somewhere on the coordinate plane, how can we tell if it is or is not a solution?\" (There appears to be a line that separates the solutions from non-solutions. If it's on the same side of the line as other solutions, then it is a solution.)</li>\n<li>\"What might be a good way to show all the possible solutions to a linear inequality in two variables? Is there a better way other than plotting individual points?\" (We can shade the region that contains the points that are solutions.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ask students: \"How can we tell where exactly the solution region stops and non-solution region starts?\" Solicit some ideas from students. If no one predicts that the line is the graph of an equation related to the inequality, remind students that when we solved inequalities in one variable, we used a related equation to help us identify a boundary value (a point on a number line). We can do the same here.</p>\n<p>Take the first inequality,\\( x \\geq y \\), as an example. Explain that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The solutions to\\( x=y \\)are all coordinate pairs where\\( x \\)and\\( y \\)are equal. We can graph it as line that goes through\\( (\\text-1, \\text-1), (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) \\), and so on.</li>\n<li>The solutions to\\( x \\geq y \\)are all coordinate pairs where\\( x \\)equals ;\\( y \\)(such as the points previously noted), and where\\( x \\)is greater than\\( y \\)(such as\\( (2,1), (3, 2), (4,2) \\)). The latter are all located below the line.</li>\n<li>We can shade the region below the line to represent the solutions to\\( x\\geq y \\).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the next activity, students will take a closer look at whether the boundary line itself is part of the solution region. For now, it is sufficient that students see that the graph of an equation that is related to each inequality delineates the solution and non-solution regions.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>\\( x \\geq y \\)</p><img alt=\"Graph of inequality with solution and non-solution regions.\" height=\"197\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b3ff94e5b644ec749c1130e0284e9fbd3a8e107a\" width=\"197\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>\\( \\text-2y \\geq \\text-4 \\)</p><img alt=\"Graph of inequality with solution and non-solution regions.\" height=\"197\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/30ddf71d89457839f964a7140abcaa4f7e2364dc\" width=\"197\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>\\( 3x&lt;0 \\)</p><img alt=\"Graph of inequality with solution and non-solution regions.\" height=\"197\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/bfc0b73aa2e0dc206e5f925ba1f0200265209586\" width=\"197\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>\\( x+y&gt;10 \\)</p><img alt=\"Graph of inequality with solution and non-solution regions.\" height=\"197\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c8184078715198335377748e2623aa9330825b72\" width=\"197\">\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4><br></h4>\n<h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>\n<div>\n<p><em></em>Use this routine to support whole-class discussion.
