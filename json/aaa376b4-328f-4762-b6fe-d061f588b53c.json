They start with square roots and perfect squares and move to make conclusions about cubed roots.</p>\n<p>In the following activities, students work to write radicals as terms with rational exponents and vice versa. They then work to apply the properties for exponents to terms that include rational exponents.</p>\n<p>In the cool-down, students also revisit negative exponents when exploring how properties work with rational exponents.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Simplify radical expressions with even and odd indexes. </li>\n  <li> Rewrite radicals as terms with rational exponents and vice versa. </li>\n  <li> Use properties for exponents with rational exponents. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li> Simplify radical expressions with even and odd indexes. </li>\n  <li> Rewrite expressions with rational exponents as roots. </li>\n  <li> Use properties for exponents with rational exponents. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td valign=\"top\">\n        <p>A11(B) <u>simplify numeric and algebraic expressions using the laws of exponents</u>, including integral and <u>rational exponents.</u></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Partial coverage: Lesson provides content that covers part of this TEKS.
