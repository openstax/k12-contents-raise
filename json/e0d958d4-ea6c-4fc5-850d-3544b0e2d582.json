There are options for how much of the modeling cycle students undertake. In one optional activity, students collect data for the bounce heights of different balls, while in two activities the data are provided. In all cases, the data are deliberately &ldquo;messy&rdquo; to mirror data students would gather through experimentation, and students are left to decide what kind of model to use. Though the data are not perfectly exponential or linear, an exponential model fits much better.</p>\n<p>Once students decide to use an exponential model, they still have to find the parameters that best fit the data while maintaining a reasonable level of accuracy. Some may just use the quotient of the first two bounce heights, while others may look more closely at all of the bounce heights. As they compare and critique the different models, students construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.</p>\n<p>Technology isn&rsquo;t required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems. We recommend making technology available.</p>\n<p>Making internet-enabled devices available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically.</p>\n<h4> Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Choose an appropriate model for a situation when given data. </li>\n<li> Determine graphing windows that would make a graph more informative or meaningful. </li>\n<li> Use exponential functions to model situations that involve exponential growth or decay. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)&nbsp;</h4>\n<ul>\n<li> Use exponential functions to model situations that involve exponential growth or decay. </li>\n<li> Determine an appropriate model for a situation described by data. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4> Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)&nbsp;</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<colgroup>\n<col>\n<col>\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>A9(C) write exponential functions in the form \\(f(x) = ab^x\\) (where \\(b\\)&nbsp;is a rational number) to describe problems arising from mathematical and real-world situations, including growth and decay;</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Foundational: Lesson provides foundational content necessary for students to be able to perform this TEKS in later lessons.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 5.11.1: Changing the Graphing Window </li>\n<li> 5.11.2: Choosing an Appropriate Model </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 5.11.2: Self Check&nbsp; </li>\n<li> 5.11.2: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 5.11.3: (Optional) Modeling with Exponential Functions </li>\n<li> 5.11.4: Examine Exponential Decay in Context </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 5.11.4: Self Check&nbsp; </li>\n<li> 5.11.4: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 5.11.5: Using Relationship Models to Answer Questions </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 5.11.6: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<ul>\n<li> A collection of balls that bounce (optional activity) </li>\n<li> Measuring tapes (optional activity) </li>\n<li> Graphing technology </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<p>Graphing technology should be available if students request it.
