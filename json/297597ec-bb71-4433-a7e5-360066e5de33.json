Here, students are given tables of values and asked to generalize the relationship between pairs of quantities&mdash;by studying the values and looking for patterns, and by interpreting them in context. Some of the relationships they encounter here are novel or otherwise require perseverance and careful reasoning to pin down.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h3>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify and describe (orally and in writing) patterns in tables of values and in calculations.</li>\n<li>Use observed patterns to generalize the relationships between quantities and to write equations.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"body\">\n</div>\n<h3>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Use words and equations to describe the patterns in a table of values or in a set of calculations.</li>\n<li>Use representations, like diagrams and tables, to help make sense of a described situation and write equations for it.\n        </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"col\">TEKS</th>\n<th scope=\"col\">Explanation of Coverage</th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>A2(C) <u>write linear equations in two variables given a table of values</u>, a graph, <u>and a verbal description</u>.</td>\n<td>Partial coverage: Lesson provides content that covers part of this TEKS.
