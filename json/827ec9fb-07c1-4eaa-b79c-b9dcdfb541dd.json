They also notice that when a quadratic expression has no constant term (that is, is in the form of \\(x^2+bx\\)), its factors are a variable and a sum (or a difference). Their awareness of this structure prepares them to think about how the linear term in a quadratic expression affects the behavior of the graph later in the lesson.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Give them a moment of quiet time to think individually, and then time to briefly share their responses with their partner.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>Complete each row with an equivalent expression in standard form or factored form.</li>\n</ol>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"137\">\n    <col width=\"137\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Standard Form</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Factored Form</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x^2\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>a. _____</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>d. _____</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x(x+9)\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x^2-18x\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>b. _____</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>e. _____</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x(6-x)\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(-x^2+10x\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>c. _____</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>f. _____</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(-x(x+2.75)\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" type=\"a\">\n    <li> What is the factored form of \\(x^2\\)? </li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(x\\cdot x\\)</p>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\" type=\"a\">\n    <li> What is the factored form of \\(x^2-18x\\)? </li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(x(x-18)\\)</p>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\" type=\"a\">\n    <li> What is the factored form of \\(-x^2+10x\\)? </li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(-x(x-10)\\) or \\(x(-x+10)\\) or \\(x(10-x)\\)</p>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"4\" type=\"a\">\n    <li> What is the standard form of \\(x(x+9)\\)? </li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(x^2+9x\\)</p>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"5\" type=\"a\">\n    <li> What is the standard form of \\(x(6-x)\\)? </li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(-x^2+6x\\)</p>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"6\" type=\"a\">\n    <li> What is the standard form of \\(-x(x+2.75)\\)? </li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(-x^2-2.75x\\)</p>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n  <li>What do the quadratic expressions in each column have in common (besides the fact that everything in the left column is in standard form and everything in the other column is in factored form)?

In the right column, one of the factors is just a variable whose coefficient is 1 or -1, and the other factor is either a sum or a difference.</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Consider displaying the completed table for all to see. If needed, discuss only the last few expressions that can be written in a few different but equivalent ways.</p>\n<p>Then, focus the discussion on the second question. Ask students:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> \"Look at all the quadratic expressions in standard form. What do they have in common?\" (They have a squared term and a linear term. They do not have a constant term.) </li>\n  <li> \"From these expressions, what can we predict, if anything, about the features of the graphs that represent them?\" (Their \\(y\\)-intercept is \\((0,0)\\).) \"Can you tell where the \\(x\\)-intercepts or the vertex will be?\" (Not easily.) </li>\n  <li> \"Look at all the expressions in factored form. What do they have in common?\" (They are all in the form of \\(x\\) or -\\(x\\) times a sum or a difference.) </li>\n  <li> \"From these expressions, what can we predict, if anything, about the features of the graphs?\" (We can \"see\" their \\(x\\)-intercepts and the vertex.) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remind students that they have looked at how the constant term and the coefficient of the squared term affect the features of a graph representing a quadratic function. Tell them that they will now explore how the linear term influences the graph, and that along the way, it can be helpful to think flexibly about the expressions that represent a function.</p>"
