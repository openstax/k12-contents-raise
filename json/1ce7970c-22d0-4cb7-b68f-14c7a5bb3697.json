They always follow a pattern of \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\) or \\(a^2 &minus; 2ab + b^2\\). </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 6.6.2: Factoring Perfect Square Trinomials </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> In this activity, you learned how to factor perfect square trinomials. You can recognize that they will always factor to a form of \\((a + b)^2\\) or \\((a &minus; b)^2\\). In some cases, you first need to factor the GCF out of the existing terms. </li>\n    <li> 6.6.2: Self Check </li>\n    <li>6.6.2: Additional Resources</li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 6.6.3: Factoring the Difference of Squares </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> In this activity, you learned how to factor using the difference of squares. In these problems, the middle term will always cancel to the form of \\((a^2 &minus; b^2)\\). There are no binomial factors that multiply together to get a sum of squares, so \\(a^2 + b^2\\) is prime. </li>\n    <li> 6.6.3: Self Check </li>\n    <li>6.6.3: Additional Resources</li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 6.6.4: Sorting Polynomials by Factoring Methods </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> In this activity, you practiced recognizing which of these two methods you would use to factor based on the polynomial you were given. You learned that it is possible to have a polynomial that requires both of these methods to be factored completely. </li>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 6.6.5: Practice </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <!--pulldown-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n      <p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n      <p>Correct!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n      <p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!--Do not edit below line.-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n</div>"
