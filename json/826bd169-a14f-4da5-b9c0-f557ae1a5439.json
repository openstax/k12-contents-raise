This constant is called the common ratio of the sequence. The common ratio can be found by dividing any term in the sequence by the previous term. If \\(a_1\\) is the initial term of a geometric sequence and \\(r\\) is the common ratio, the sequence will be</p>\n<p>{\\(a_1, a_1\\cdot r\\), \\(a_1\\cdot r^2\\), \\(a_1\\cdot r^3\\), . . .}</p>\n<p>How to:</p>\n<p>Given a set of numbers, determine if they represent a geometric sequence.</p>\n<ol>\n  <li> Divide each term by the previous term.</li>\n  <li>Compare the quotients. If they are the same, a common ratio exists and the sequence is geometric.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>Is the sequence geometric?
