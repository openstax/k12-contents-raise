You will use your understanding of constraints, equations, and points on a graph to explain whether a graph represents an equation and a situation. Along the way, you will practice reasoning quantitatively and abstractly and constructing logical arguments.<br><span><br>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:<br><br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find the slope and vertical intercept of a line with equation \\( ax+by=c \\).</li>\n<li>Take an equation of the form \\( ax+by=c \\) and rearrange it into the equivalent form \\( y=mx+b \\).</li>\n<li>Use a variety of strategies to find the slope and vertical intercept of the graph of a linear equation given in different forms.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><span>1.11.1: Applying the Distributive Property to Rewrite Expressions&nbsp;</span><br></li>\n<li>1.11.2: Relating Two-Variable Equations, Their Graphs, and Situations<ul>\n<li>1.11.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li>1.11.2: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>1.11.3:Reasoning Symbolically and Abstractly about Linear Equations<ul>\n<li>1.11.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li>1.11.3: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>1.11.4: Identifying the Features of a Graph</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1.11.5: Practice</li>\n<li>1.11.6: Lesson Summary</li>\n</ul>\n"
