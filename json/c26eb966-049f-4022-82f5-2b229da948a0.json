Tyler claims that the standard form is more useful. Clare thinks the factored form is the way to go. If you were Tyler, how would you support your claim? What if you were Clare?\" </li>\n  <li> Drawing a Venn diagram for all to see and asking students to compare the features of a graph that can be identified from standard and factored forms. </li>\n</ul>"
