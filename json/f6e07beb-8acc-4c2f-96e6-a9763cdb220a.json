You will begin to build quadratic functions that describe free-falling situations and situations that involve gravity and motion and use these functions to solve problems. You will explore problems including arrows, fireworks, and cannonballs whose paths are represented by quadratic functions.</p>\n<p>This section includes five lessons:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Building Quadratic Functions from Geometric Patterns </li>\n  <li> Comparing Quadratic and Exponential Functions </li>\n  <li> Building Quadratic Functions to Describe Situations, Part 1 </li>\n  <li> Building Quadratic Functions to Describe Situations, Part 2 </li>\n  <li> Building Quadratic Functions to Describe Situations, Part 3 </li>\n</ul>"
