This warm-up reminds students about this fact, while also prompting them to use what they learned in this unit to better understand what it means for a system to have infinitely many solutions.</p>\n  <p>The first equation shows two variables adding up to 3, so students choose a pair of values whose sum is 3. They notice that all pairs chosen are solutions to the system. Next, they try to find a strategy that can show that there are countless other pairs that also satisfy the constraints in the system. Monitor for these likely strategies:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Solving by graphing: The graphs of the two equations are the same line, so all the points on the line are solutions to the system.</li>\n    <li>Solving by substitution: The first equation can be rearranged to&nbsp;<span>\\( y = 3 - x \\)</span>. Substituting&nbsp;<span>\\( 3-x \\)</span>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<span>\\( y \\)</span>&nbsp;in the second equation gives&nbsp;<span>\\( 4x = 12 - 4(3-x) \\)</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span>\\( 4x = 12-12+4x \\)</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span>\\( 4x = 4x \\)</span>. This equation is true no matter what&nbsp;<span>\\( x \\)</span>&nbsp;is.</li>\n    <li>Solving by elimination: If we multiply the first equation by 4, rearrange the second equation to&nbsp;<span>\\( 4x+4y=12 \\)</span>, and then subtract the second equation from the first, the result is&nbsp;<span>\\( 4y=4y \\)</span>. Subtracting&nbsp;<span>\\( 4y \\)</span>&nbsp;from each side gives&nbsp;<span>\\( 0=0 \\)</span>, which is true regardless of what&nbsp;<span>\\( x \\)</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span>\\( y \\)</span>&nbsp;is.</li>\n    <li>Reasoning about equivalent equations: If we rearrange the second equation so that the variables are on the same side,&nbsp;<span>\\( 4x+4y=12 \\)</span>, we can see that this equation is a multiple of the first and that the equations are equivalent. This means they have the identical solution set, which contains infinite possible pairs of&nbsp;<span>\\( x \\)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>\\( y \\)</span>.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Identify students using different strategies and ask them to share their thinking with the class later.</p>\n  <p>Making graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically.</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<div>\n  <p>Arrange students into groups of 3&ndash;4. Give students 1&ndash;2 minutes of quiet time to complete the first two questions. Remind students that the numbers don&rsquo;t need to be integers. Then, give students a minute to share with their group their two values and whether the pair is a solution to the second equation.</p>\n  <p>Pause for a brief whole-class discussion. Consider quickly recording all the pairs that students have verified to be solutions to the second equation and displaying them for all to see. Ask: &ldquo;Which pairs of numbers are the solution to the system?&rdquo; (all of them)</p>\n  <p>Ask students to proceed to the last question. Students may conclude that seeing all the pairs that satisfy both equations is enough to show that the system has many solutions. If so, ask how many solutions they think there are, and ask: &ldquo;Can you show that any two numbers that add up to 3 is also a solution to the system, without having to do calculations for each pair?&rdquo;</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>\n<div>\n  <p>Andre is trying to solve this system of equations:&nbsp;<span>\\( \\begin {cases} x + y = 3\\\\ 4x = 12 - 4y \\end{cases} \\)</span></p>\n  <p>Looking at the first equation, he thought, &ldquo;The solution to the system is a pair of numbers that add up to 3. I wonder which two numbers they are.&rdquo;</p>\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n    <li>Choose any two numbers that add up to 3. Let the first one be the&nbsp;<span>\\( x \\)</span>-value and the second one be the&nbsp;<span>\\( y \\)</span>-value.</li>\n    <li>The pair of values you chose is a solution to the first equation. Check if it is also a solution to the second equation. Then, pause for a brief discussion with your group.</li>\n    <li>How many solutions does the system have? Use what you know about equations and solving systems to show that you are right.</li>\n  </ol>\n</div>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<div>\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n    <li>Compare your answer: 4 and \\(-1\\), 0 and 3,&nbsp;<span>\\( \\frac78 \\)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>\\( 2\\frac18 \\)</span></li>\n    <li>Yes, it is also a solution to the second equation. Sample reasoning for 4 and \\(-1\\): Substituting 4 and \\(-1\\) into the second equation gives&nbsp;<span>\\( 4(4) = 12 - 4(\\text-1) \\)</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span>\\( 16 = 12 + 4 \\)</span>, which is a true equation.</li>\n    <li>Infinitely many solutions. See the Activity Narrative for some possible explanations.</li>\n  </ol>\n</div>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<div>\n  <p>Ask the class how many solutions they think the system has. Select previously identified students to explain how they know that the system has infinitely many solutions, or that any pair of values that add up to 3 and make the first equation true also make the second equation true.</p>\n  <p>Students are likely to think of using graphs. It is not essential to elicit all strategies shown in the Activity Narrative, but if no one thinks of an algebraic explanation, be sure to bring one up. The last strategy mentioned in the Narrative (reasoning about equivalent equations) is likely to be intuitive to students.</p>\n  <p>Make sure students see that the equations are equivalent, so all pairs of&nbsp;<span>\\( x \\)-</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>\\( y \\)-</span>values that make one equation true also make the other equation true, giving an infinite number of solutions.</p>\n</div>"
