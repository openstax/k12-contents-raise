The activity is designed to be completed without the use of graphing technology.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Ask students to put away any devices.</p>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>\n<p>Members of a high school math club have a scavenger hunt. Three items are hidden in the park, which is a rectangle that measures 50 meters by 20 meters.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The clues are written as systems of inequalities. One system has no solutions.</li>\n  <li>The locations of the items can be narrowed down by solving the systems. A coordinate plane can be used to describe the solutions.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<p>Can you find the hidden items? Sketch a graph to show where each item could be hidden.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For each clue, graph each inequality separately on the same coordinate grid.</p>\n<p><strong>Clue 1:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>\\(y&gt;14\\)<br><span>\\(x&lt;10\\)</span><br></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Blank grid, origin O.

Where did the possible solutions lie on the graph?</p><br>\n<h4>Student-Facing Extension</h4>\n<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Two non-negative numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) satisfy \\(x+y\\leq1\\).</span></p>\n<ol>\n  <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Find a second inequality, also using \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) values greater than or equal to zero, to make a system of inequalities with exactly one solution.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Find as many ways to answer this question as you can.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Extension Student Response</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>For example: \\(y\\geq1\\). Other responses include \\(x\\geq1\\) and any inequality of the form \\(y\\leq ax\\), where \\(a\\) is negative.</span></p><br>\n<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some students may have trouble interpreting the graph of the fourth system, wondering if a point in either of the shaded regions on the graph could be where an item is hidden. Ask them to pick a point on the graph and consider whether it satisfies the first inequality, and then whether it satisfies the second inequality. Remind them that a solution to a system needs to satisfy both.</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Invite students to share their graphs and strategies for finding the solution regions. In particular, discuss how they found out which system had no solutions.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Remind students that a system of linear equations has no solutions if the graphs of the equations are two parallel lines that never intersect. Explain that a system of linear inequalities has no solutions if their regions are bound by two parallel lines and the solution region of each one is on the &ldquo;outside&rdquo; of the parallel lines, as is the case with the last given system.</p>\n<h4>2.13.4: Self Check&nbsp;</h4>\n<p><strong><em>Following the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong><br></p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<div align=\"left\" dir=\"ltr\">\n  <table>\n    <colgroup>\n      <col width=\"200\">\n      <col width=\"400\">\n    </colgroup>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td colspan=\"2\"><strong>QUESTION</strong>: <br>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\">Which two inequalities are graphed in the system of inequalities below?</p>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"GRAPH OF A SYSTEM OF INEQUALITIES WITH SOLID VERTICAL LINE THROUGH X EQUALS 2 AND SHADING TO THE RIGHT AND DOTTED LINE WITH Y\" class=\"img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom\" height=\"305\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/98f309c938b4c05a87eb641f2075ade1dc760157\" width=\"300\"></p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong><br></p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          \\(x\\leq2\\\\y&gt;3x-1\\\\\\)<br>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\">Incorrect.
