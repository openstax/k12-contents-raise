For each unit, print out the word wall pages that relate to the unit to post in the classroom.

Other teachers prefer to rotate out old words with new ones throughout the course. For example, they might start the year reviewing relevant words from grade 8, such as those related to linear functions and solving equations, and introduce new words along with each lesson in unit one.</p>"
