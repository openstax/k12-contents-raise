In this lesson, students will familiarize themselves with graphing technology in order to display a data set modeling a quadratic function. They will learn how to use this graphing technology to analyze the data set and generate an equation for a curve of best fit. These equations, modeling real-world situations, can be used to make predictions about those situations.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Use graphing technology, such as Desmos, to input a data set modeling a quadratic function and display a scatter plot of the data. </li>\n  <li> Generate an quadratic equation for a curve of best, or regression curve, using graphing technology. </li>\n  <li> Analyze a situation modeled by a quadratic function and use a curve of best fit to make predictions about that situation. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Graph a quadratic data set using technology. </li>\n  <li> Find a regression curve, or curve of best fit, using a quadratic data set. </li>\n  <li> Use a regression curve to create a quadratic model for making predictions. </li>\n  <li> Make predictions about a real-world situation using a quadratic data set. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>A8(B) write, using technology, quadratic functions that provide a reasonable fit to data to estimate solutions and make predictions for real-world problems.</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> 8.12.1: Graphing a Quadratic Data Set Using Technology </li>\n  <li> 8.12.2: Finding the Curve of Best Fit </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> 8.12.2: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 8.12.2: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 8.12.3: Making Predictions Using a Quadratic Model </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> 8.12.3: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 8.12.3: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 8.12.4: Finding the Missing Data in the Set </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 8.12.5: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Paper and pencil </li>\n  <li> Graphing technology </li>\n  <li> <a href=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/db917d527d809e43059182a3e3d05b0310ccf4bd\" target=\"_blank\">Master List of Data Sets: Lesson 8.12</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Acquire devices that can run Desmos (recommended) or other graphing technology.
