In this lesson, students encounter quadratic expressions without a linear term and consider how to write them in factored form.</p>\n<p>Students begin by studying numerical examples and noticing that expressions such as \\((20 + 1)(20 &minus; 1)\\) and \\(20^2&minus; 1^2\\) (which is a difference of two squares) are equivalent. Students are able to generalize the equivalence of these two forms as \\((x + m)(x &minus; m) = x^2&minus; m^2\\). Then, they rewrite these expressions from one form to the other.</p>\n<p>Along the way, they encounter a variety of quadratic expressions that can be seen as differences of two squares, including those in which the squared term has a coefficient other than 1, and expressions that involve fractions.</p>\n<p>Students also consider why a difference of two squares (such as \\(x^2&minus; 25\\)) can be written in factored form, but a sum of two squares (such as \\(x^2 + 25\\)) cannot be, even though both are quadratic expressions with no linear term.</p>\n<p>Remind students that when they want to enter a number with an exponent, they should use the ^ symbol. It will look like \"\\(x^2\\)\" when they want to enter \\(x^2\\). To make the ^ symbol, push shift and the numeral 6 at the same time.</p>\n<p>After this lesson, students will have the tools they need to solve factorable quadratic equations given in standard form by first rewriting them in factored form. That work begins in the next lesson.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Explain that multiplying binomials that are a sum and a difference, \\((x + m)(x &minus; m)\\), results in a quadratic with no linear term and explain (orally) why this is the case. </li>\n  <li> Write equivalent expressions in factored form when given quadratic expressions that are the difference of squares. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Explain why multiplying binomials that are a sum and a difference, \\((x + m)(x &minus; m)\\), results in a quadratic expression with no linear term. </li>\n  <li> Rewrite a quadratic expression of the form \\(x^2&minus; c\\) into its factored form. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>A8(A) solve quadratic equations having real solutions by factoring, taking square roots, completing the square, and applying the quadratic formula.</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Foundational: Lesson provides foundational content necessary for students to be able to perform this TEKS in later lessons.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> 8.8.1: Evaluating Expressions Using Mental Math </li>\n  <li> 8.8.2: Recognizing the Expanded Product of the Difference of Two Squares </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> 8.8.2: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 8.8.2: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 8.8.3: Factoring Quadratic Equations Without a Linear Term </li>\n  <ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n    <li> 8.8.3: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 8.8.3: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 8.8.4: Determining if an Expression Can Be Rewritten in Factored Form </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 8.8.5: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Paper and pencil </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> None </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson. </li>\n  <li> Encourage students to look for these words and notice their use and meanings. </li>\n  <li> Encourage students to use key vocabulary words in \"math talk\" and their written and oral explanations. </li>\n  <li> Utilize a word wall.
