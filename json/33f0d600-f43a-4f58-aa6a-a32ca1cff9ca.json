They represent the pattern of decrease with an equation and interpret the different parts of the equation in terms of the context (the depreciation of a car). The definition of growth factor is expanded to accommodate situations involving decrease.</p>\n<h4> Launch</h4>\n<p>Explain the scenario to the class. Many students may need additional explanation about how a car depreciates. It is possible to just display the first sentence of the task if you think the students understand the information necessary for the situation: Every year after a new car is purchased, it loses \\(\\frac13\\) of its value. Another way to think about this is that the car retains \\(\\frac23\\) of its value each year. Let&rsquo;s say that a new car costs $18,000.</p>\n<p>Ask the class to estimate: Without calculating, what do you think the value of the car will be 4 years after it was purchased as a new car? Poll the class for their estimates.</p>\n<p>Clarify to students that they may complete the table with numerical expressions that show how to find the values rather than with the results of evaluating the expressions.</p>\n<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>\n<div>\n  <p> To help students make sense of the language of exponential decay, start by displaying only the context for the question: &ldquo;Every year after a new car is purchased, it loses \\(\\frac13\\) of its value. Let&rsquo;s say that a new car costs $18,000.&rdquo; Give students 1&ndash;2 minutes to write their own mathematical questions about the situation. Then invite students to share their questions with the class. Listen for and amplify any questions about the future value of the car, especially those using language such as &ldquo;losing value&rdquo; and &ldquo;decrease.&rdquo; This will build student understanding of the language of exponential decay and help ensure students interpret the task correctly.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n<div>\n  <p>Activate or supply background knowledge.

Another way to think about this is that the car retains \\(\\frac23\\) of its value each year. Let&rsquo;s say that a new car&rsquo;s value is $18,000. </p>\n<ol>\n  <li> A buyer worries that the car will be worth nothing in three years. Do you agree? Explain your reasoning. <br><br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> Disagree. Sample explanation: If the car loses a third of its value each year, then after one year its value will be \\(\\frac23\\) of $18,000 or $12,000. After two years its value will be \\(\\frac23\\) of $12,000 or $8,000. And after three years its value will be \\(\\frac23\\) of $8,000 or about $5,333. The buyer might have thought that &ldquo;losing a third of its value each year&rdquo; meant losing $6,000 each year, so after 3 years the cars would be worthless (because \\(3 \\cdot 6,000=18,000\\)). He may not realize that after one year, the value of the car is no longer $18,000.\n  </li>\n  <br>\n  <li> Write an expression to show how to find the value of the car for each year listed in the table.

How much area is removed after the nth step? Use a calculator to find out how much area remains in the triangle after 50 such steps have been taken. <br><br>\n  <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Each step, \\(\\frac14\\) of the remaining area is removed since taking away \\(\\frac14\\) from each smaller triangle results in taking \\(\\frac14\\) of the total remaining area. That means that each step, the remaining area is multiplied by \\(\\frac34\\) since \\(1-\\frac{1}{4} =\\frac{3}{4}\\). So after \\(n\\) steps, the remaining area is simply \\((\\frac{3}{4})^n\\). After 50 steps, this leaves an area of only about 0.000000566321656 square units, so there&rsquo;s almost nothing left!\n</p>\n<p>If you can imagine doing this process forever, the resulting shape is called the Sierpinski triangle.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Sierpinski triangle.\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/17fab6ffcd13f3a75e74ab3d35dd42ae1b2bf948\"></p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Make sure that students understand the expression for the value of cars after \\(t\\) years came from multiplying by \\(\\frac23\\) repeatedly (\\(t\\) times). Tell students that we still say this quantity changes exponentially, though sometimes people use the more specific terms &ldquo;exponential growth&rdquo; and &ldquo;exponential decay&rdquo; to indicate whether the amount is increasing or decreasing. The multiplier is still called the growth factor, but when it is a positive number less than 1, the result decreases with every iteration. Sometimes people use &ldquo;decay factor&rdquo; to indicate that a quantity that decreases exponentially involves a positive factor less than 1.</p>\n<p>Questions for discussion:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>&ldquo;Why does it make sense to multiply an entry in one row by \\(\\frac23\\) to get the entry for the next row?&rdquo; (Each year, only \\(\\frac23\\) of the car value remains.)</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;Why not write the expression for each year as subtraction, for instance, \\(18,000-\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 18,000\\)?&rdquo; (We could, but writing subtraction can get unwieldy quickly. For year 2, the expression would be \\((18,000- \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 18,000)- \\frac{1}{3}(18,000- \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 18,000)\\). If we calculate the value of each term, it would be simpler \\((12,000- \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 12,000)\\), but it would still not allow us to see a pattern and write a general expression as easily.)</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;Does the \\(\\frac45\\) in the last equation mean losing \\(\\frac45\\) of the value each year? Why or why not?&rdquo; (No. Multiplying by \\(\\frac45\\) repeatedly means each time only \\(\\frac45\\) of the value remains, so the car is losing \\(\\frac15\\) of its value each year.)</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;Will the value of the second car (starting at $10,000 and losing \\(\\frac15\\) of it each year) ever be worth more than the first car (starting at $18,000 and losing \\(\\frac13\\) of it each year)? Explain.&rdquo; (Yes. After 4 years, the value of the second car will be $4,096, while the value of the first car will be $3,555.56.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Make sure that students understand the exponential expression for the value of a car after \\(t\\) years came from multiplying by \\(\\frac23\\) repeatedly (\\(t\\) times).</p>\n<h3>5.5.2: Self Check&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION: </strong></p>\n        <p>Which of the following could represent a population of bacteria, \\(b\\), that decreases at a rate of \\(\\frac18\\) every hour, \\(h\\)?

There are several options:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\\(\n    5000-(\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot 5000)\\) </li>\n  <li> \\(5000 \\cdot \\frac{4}{5}\\) </li>\n  <li>\\(\n    4000\\) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each line is the simplification of the line above it.

There are several expressions to represent that:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> \\(5000 \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5}\\)&nbsp; </li>\n  <li> \\(4000 \\cdot \\frac{4}{5}\\)&nbsp; </li>\n  <li>\\(\n    4000-(\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot 4000)\\) </li>\n  <li>\\(3200\\) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Basically, you take the answer from April and multiply by \\(\\frac45\\) again since the growth factor is \\(\\frac45\\).

After the 2nd month, you multiplied the initial value by the growth factor twice, so for this situation you would need to multiply the initial value by the growth factor 6 times, or raise it to the sixth power.
