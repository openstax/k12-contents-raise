Students will now be provided the zeros of a quadratic function and convert them into the factored form and standard form of that function.</p>\n<p>Students will also distinguish between finding a quadratic function that has certain zeros and finding the specific quadratic function that has certain zeros and passes through a particular point. They will learn to differentiate between these related quadratic functions.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Convert fluently between a quadratic function's zeros, its factored form, and its standard form. </li>\n  <li> Identify the zeros on the graph of a quadratic function and use them to write the standard form of that function. </li>\n  <li> Use the intercept form of a quadratic function, \\(f(x) = a(x &minus; p)(x &minus; q)\\), to define a specific function given its zeros and a point. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)&nbsp;</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Find the standard form of a quadratic function given its zeros. </li>\n  <li> Find the standard form of a quadratic function given its graph. </li>\n  <li> Use the intercept form of a quadratic function to define a specific function given its zeros and a point. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>A6(C) write quadratic functions when given real solutions and graphs of their related equations.</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> 8.11.1: Relating a Quadratic Function and Its Zeros </li>\n  <li> 8.11.2: Finding a Quadratic Function from Its Zeros </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> 8.11.2: Self Check&nbsp; </li>\n    <li> 8.11.2: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 8.11.3: Finding a Quadratic Function from Its Zeros and a Point </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> 8.11.3: Self Check&nbsp; </li>\n    <li> 8.11.3: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 8.11.4: Writing Quadratics When Given Any Format </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 8.11.5: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Paper and pencil </li>\n  <li> Graphing technology </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Acquire devices that can run Desmos (recommended) or other graphing technology.
