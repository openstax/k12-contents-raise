They use their understanding of constraints, equations, and points on a graph to explain whether a graph represents an equation and a situation. Along the way, students practice reasoning quantitatively and abstractly and constructing logical arguments.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Students also work with the structure of linear equations outside of contextual situations. They analyze and rearrange equations to determine the slope and y-intercept of their graphs and practice explaining their reasoning.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Technology isn't required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems. We recommend making technology available.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)&nbsp;</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Determine the slope and vertical intercept of the graphs of linear equations by making use of structure or by rearranging the equations.</li>\n  <li>Write an equivalent equation of the form \\( y=mx+b \\), given an equation of the form \\( ax+by=c \\).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)&nbsp;</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>Find the slope and vertical intercept of a line with equation \\( ax+by=c \\).</li>\n  <li>Take an equation of the form&nbsp;\\( ax+by=c \\) and rearrange it into the equivalent form \\( y=mx+b \\).</li>\n  <li>Use a variety of strategies to find the slope and vertical intercept of the graph of a linear equation given in different forms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)&nbsp;</h4>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><strong>TEKS</strong></td>\n      <td><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>A3(A) <u>determine the slope of a line given</u> a table of values, a graph, two points on the line, and <u>an equation written in various forms</u><u>, including \\( y = mx + b \\), \\( Ax + By = C \\)</u>, and \\( y-y_1=m(x-x_1) \\).</td>\n      <td>Partial coverage: Lesson provides content that covers part of this TEKS.
