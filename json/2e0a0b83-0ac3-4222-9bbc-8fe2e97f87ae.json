Some things to highlight:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n    They are both types of sequences. That is, they are both lists of numbers.\n  </li>\n<li>\n    To get from one term to the next for both arithmetic and geometric sequences, you &ldquo;do the same thing each time.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>\n    For geometric sequences, you always multiply by the same number to get the next term. For arithmetic sequences, you always add the same number to get the next term.\n  </li>\n<li>\n    Geometric sequences have growth factors (the quotient of any term and the previous term), but arithmetic sequences have a constant rate of change (the difference of any term and the previous term).\n  </li>\n</ul>"
