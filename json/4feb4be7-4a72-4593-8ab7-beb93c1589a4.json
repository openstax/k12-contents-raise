You will then set up direct variation equations and work to solve problems. Direct variation is seen in everyday life in a variety of proportional relationships. Examples include the amount a paycheck increases with more hours of work; the distance a car travels compared to its rate of speed; and the cost of an electric bill based on the amount of electricity used.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set up and solve direct variation problems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1.14.0: Lesson Overview</li>\n<li>1.14.1: Solving Proportions</li>\n<li>1.14.2: Modeling Equations Using Direct Variation<ul>\n<li>1.14.2: Self Check <br></li>\n<li>1.14.2: Additional Resources<br></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>1.14.3: Using Direct Variation to Solve Application Problems, Part 1<ul>\n<li>1.14.3: Self Check <br></li>\n<li>1.14.3: Additional Resources<br></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>1.14.4: Using Direct Variation to Solve Application Problems, Part 2</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1.14.5: Practice</li>\n<li>1.14.6: Lesson Summary</li>\n</ul>"
