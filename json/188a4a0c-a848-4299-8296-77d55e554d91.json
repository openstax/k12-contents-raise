The population was 40,000 in 1930 and about 45,000 in 1950, an increase of 5,000 people over 20 years, which equals 250 people per year.<br>\n    <br>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <ol type=\"A\">\n      <li>Positive </li>\n      <li>Negative </li>\n      <li>Negative <br>\n        <br>\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li>From 1910 to 1920.
