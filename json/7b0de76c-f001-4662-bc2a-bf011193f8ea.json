The set of the first components of each ordered pair are the inputs and the set of the second components of each ordered pair are the outputs. Consider the following set of ordered pairs. The first numbers in each pair are the first five natural numbers. The second number in each pair is twice that of the first. </p>\n<p>{\\((1,2),(2,4),(3,6),(4,8),(5,10)\\)}</p>\n<p>The set of inputs is {\\(1,2,3,4,5\\)}. The set of outputs is {\\(2,4,6,8,10\\)}.</p>\n<p>Each <span class=\"os-raise-ib-tooltip\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\" data-store=\"glossary-tooltip\">input</span> value is the <span class=\"os-raise-ib-tooltip\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\" data-store=\"glossary-tooltip\">independent variable</span>, and is often labeled with the lowercase letter x. Each <span class=\"os-raise-ib-tooltip\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\" data-store=\"glossary-tooltip\">output</span> value, is the dependent variable <span class=\"os-raise-ib-tooltip\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\" data-store=\"glossary-tooltip\">dependent variable</span>, and is often labeled lowercase letter y. </p>\n<p>A function f is a relation that assigns a single output to each input. In other words, no x-values are repeated. For our example that relates the first five natural numbers to numbers double their values, this relation is a function because each input, {1,2,3,4,5}, is paired with exactly one output, {\\(2,4,6,8,10\\)}.</p>\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s consider the set of ordered pairs that relates the terms &ldquo;even&rdquo; and &ldquo;odd&rdquo; to the first five natural numbers. It would appear as</p>\n<p>{ (odd,1),(even,2),(odd,3),(even,4),(odd,5) }</p>\n<p>Notice that each input, {even,odd} is not paired with exactly one output, {\\(1,2,3,4,5\\)}. For example, the term &ldquo;odd&rdquo; corresponds to three output values, {1,3,5} and the term &ldquo;even&rdquo; corresponds to two output values, {\\(2,4\\)}. This violates the definition of a function, so this relation is not a function.</p>\n<p>A <span class=\"os-raise-ib-tooltip\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\" data-store=\"glossary-tooltip\">mapping</span> is sometimes used to show a relation. The arrows show the pairing of the inputs with the outputs.</p>\n<p>Here are some relations that are functions and not functions.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Three relations that demonstrate what constitute a function.\" class=\"img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom\" height=\"166\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/6b41ee83a62edd93cf9e80894490f065d2031df7\" width=\"551\"></p>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>This relationship is a function because each input is associated with a single output.
