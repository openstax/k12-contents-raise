You learned that writing an equation is one way to check if these values meet the constraint.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>2.1.2: Writing and Graphing Equations<ul>\n      <li>In this activity, you wrote equations to represent two different constraints covering the cost and amount of trail mix. These equations represent a system of linear equations. Then you graphed the system of equations and used the graph to complete a table. These are important methods when solving a system of equations.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>2.1.2: Self Check </li>\n  <li>2.1.3: Meeting Constraints<ul>\n      <li>In this activity, you analyzed a situation and found a pair of values that met two different constraints in that situation. You were then able to explain your reasoning in how you solved the systems of equations.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>2.1.3: Self Check&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>\n  <li>2.1.4: Exploring a System of Equations<ul>\n      <li>In this activity, you solved a system of equations using your preferred method of choice. Systems of equations can be solved by graphing, algebraically, guessing and checking, or using tables.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><br>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:<br></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>2.1.5: Practice</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <!--Q1-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n      <p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n      <p>Correct!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n      <p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!----------------- Must be included at the bottom of page for dropdown to work ------------>\n  <!--Do not edit below line.-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n</div>"
