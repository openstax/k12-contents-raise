Her work includes putting labels on 750 books.</p>\n  <p>1. How many minutes will she need to finish labeling all books if she takes no breaks and labels:<br>a. 10 books a minute?<br>b. 15 books a minute?<br></p>\n  <p>2. Suppose Clare labels the books at a constant speed of \\(s\\) books per minute. Write an equation that represents the relationship between her labeling speed and the number of minutes it would take her to finish labeling.</p>\n  <p></p>\n</div>\n<h3>Student Response</h3>\n<p>1. Answers:<br>a. 75 minutes<br>b. 50 minutes<span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>2. \\( s * m=750 \\) or \\( m= \\frac{750}{s} \\), where \\(m\\) is the number of minutes and \\(s\\) is the speed in books per minute.</span></p>\n<div>\n  <h3>Response to Student Thinking</h3>\n</div>\n<div>\n  <h4>More Chances</h4>\n  <p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>\n</div><br>\n<p></p>"
