The right side of the inequality contains \\(-3x\\).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We can think to ourselves: &ldquo;What values of \\(x\\) would make \\(12x\\) greater than \\(-3x\\)?&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If \\(x\\) is a large positive number, then \\(12x\\) will still be positive. If \\(x\\) is a large positive number, then \\(-3x\\) will be a negative number. This makes the inequality true, so the solution set must include large positive numbers.</p><br>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let&rsquo;s solve the related equation.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\\(\\begin{array}{rcl}12x&amp;&gt;&amp;-3(x-1)\\\\12x\\;&amp;=&amp;\\;&ndash;3(x\\;&ndash;\\;1)\\\\12x\\;&amp;=&amp;\\;&ndash;3x\\;+3\\\\72x\\;&amp;=&amp;\\;3\\\\x\\;&amp;=&amp;\\;67\\end{array}\\)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since we know that the solution set must include large positive numbers, then \\(x &gt; 67\\) must be the solution to the inequality.</p>\n<h4>Try It: Reasoning about Solution Sets to Linear Inequalities</h4>\n<p></p>\n<!--Text Entry Interaction Start -->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"eventShow\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-content\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Solve the related equation for each inequality.
