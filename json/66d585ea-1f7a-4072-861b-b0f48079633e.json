Allow 2&ndash;3 minutes for students to write down their answers, completing the table. Once they have finished, review the solution to ensure their table is correct. Emphasize that we are looking for the factors that multiply to 24 and have a sum of 10. Once students identify the correct factors, display the factored expression.</p>\n<p>As a check, use FOIL to multiply the expression the students just found. This will demonstrate why they were searching for factors that multiplied to 24 and added to 10.</p>\n<h4> Student Activity</h4>\n<p>We are going to factor the trinomial \\(q^2 + 10q + 24\\) by reversing the process of FOIL.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>Find all the different combinations of factors of 24.
