A new term, quadratic, will be used to describe patterns with squared terms.</p>\n<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Describe how a pattern is growing. </li>\n<li> Tell whether a pattern is growing linearly, exponentially, or quadratically. </li>\n<li> Explain that an expression with a squared term is called quadratic. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 7.2.1: Squares in a Geometric Pattern </li>\n<li> 7.2.2: Constant and Exponential Change </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 7.2.2: Self Check </li>\n<li> 7.2.2: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 7.2.3: Quadratic Expressions </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 7.2.3: Self Check </li>\n<li> 7.2.3: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 7.2.4: Quadratic Relationships </li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll<strong> practice and review</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 7.2.5: Practice </li>\n<li> 7.2.6: Lesson Summary </li>\n</ul>"
