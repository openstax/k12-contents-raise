The specific structure they might notice is how the values in the \\(f(x)\\) and the \\(g(x)\\) columns in each table correspond to the expression describing each function.</p>\n<p>When students articulate what they notice and wonder, they have an opportunity to attend to precision in the language they use to describe what they see. They might first use less formal or imprecise language, and then restate their observation with more precise language to communicate more clearly.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Display the tables for all to see. Tell students that their job is to think of at least one thing they notice and at least one thing they wonder. Give students 1 minute of quiet think time, and then 1 minute to discuss the things they notice with their partner, followed by a whole-class discussion.</p>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"134\">\n    <col width=\"142\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td width=\"20\">\n        <p>\\(x\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td width=\"104\">\n        <p>\\(f(x)=10&minus;2x\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>1</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>8</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>1.5</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>7</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>5</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>0</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>&ndash;2</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>14</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"153\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"134\">\n    <col width=\"142\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td width=\"21\">\n        <p>\\(x\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td width=\"100\">\n        <p>\\(g(x)=x^3\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>&ndash;2</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>&ndash;8</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>0</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>0</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>1</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>1</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>3</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>27</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<ol>\n  <li>What do you notice? </li>\n  <li>What do you wonder?</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<p>Students may notice:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The tables don't say &ldquo;input&rdquo; and &ldquo;output.&rdquo;</li>\n  <li>While there is a column labeled \\(x\\), there is not a column labeled \\(y\\).</li>\n  <li>One function is called \\(f\\).

Record and display their responses for all to see. If possible, record the relevant reasoning on or near the tables. After all responses have been recorded without commentary or editing, ask students, &ldquo;Is there anything on this list that you are wondering about?&rdquo; Encourage students to respectfully disagree, ask for clarification, or point out contradicting information.</p>"
