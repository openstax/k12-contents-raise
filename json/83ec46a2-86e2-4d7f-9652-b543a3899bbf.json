Then you practiced interpreting the language related to maximum and minimum values of functions. </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 9.9.2: Does the Vertex Represent the Minimum or Maximum Value? </li>\n<ul>\n<li> In this activity, you used the vertex form to find out if a vertex represents the minimum or the maximum value of each function. </li>\n<li> 9.9.2: Self Check </li>\n<li> 9.9.2: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 9.9.3: Comparing Maximums between Quadratics </li>\n<ul>\n<li> In this activity, you were given two functions in different forms. One was graphed, and the other was in factored form. You used these two pieces of information, without creating a graph of the function in factored form, to determine the maximum value of each one. </li>\n<li> 9.9.3: Self Check </li>\n<li> 9.9.3: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 9.9.4: Maximum, Minimum, and Analyzing the Vertex </li>\n<ul>\n<li> In this activity, you found the vertex of the graph of a quadratic function and then determined if the \\(y\\)-coordinate of the vertex corresponded to a maximum or a minimum value of the function. </li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 9.9.5: Practice </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<!--pulldown-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n<p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<p>Correct!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!--Do not edit below line.-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n</div>"
