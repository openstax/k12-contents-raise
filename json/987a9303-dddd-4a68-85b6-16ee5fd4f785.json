Circulate to ensure students are graphing their lines properly. If necessary, partner students during the graphing process.</p>\n<p>In pairs, students should discuss the vertical shifts to the parent function, \\(f(x)=x\\), to graph the new functions.</p>\n<h4> Launch</h4>\n<p>Ask students if they have ever played a board game. Connect rolling dice and moving that number of spots to the number of spots a line can shift up the graph.</p>\n<p>For students who can benefit from a more accessible model, use geoboards and rubber bands. Use one color rubber band for the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-axes. Use a different color for each line graphed. Work with students to count spots on the geoboard and discuss the graphs and their relationships.</p>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement </h4>\n<p>On the same coordinate grid, graph the following linear functions. Use a different color for each:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\\(f(x)=x+4\\) </li>\n  <li> \\(f(x)=x+2\\) </li>\n  <li> \\(f(x)=x\\) </li>\n  <li> \\(f(x)=x-2\\) </li>\n  <li> \\(f(x)=x-4\\) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Compare your graph to the one below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"This graph shows six versions of the function, f of x = x, on an x, y coordinate plane. The x-axis runs from negative 8 to 8, and the y axis runs negative 8 to 8. There are five lines parallel to each other. The first line extends from the bottom left quadrant to the upper right quadrant on the coordinate plane. This line shows f of x = x plus 4 which has a slope of 1 and a y-intercept at 4. The next line also extends from the bottom left quadrant to the upper right quadrant and shows f of x = x plus 2 which has a slope of 1 and a y-intercept at 2. The next and middle line, extends from the lower left quadrant, through the center of the graph at point (0, 0) to the upper right quadrant and shows f of x = x. The next line extends from the lower left quadrant, through the lower right quadrant to the upper right quadrant. This line shows f of x = x minus 2 which has a slope of 1 and a y-intercept at -2. The last line extends from the lower left quadrant, through the lower right quadrant to the upper right quadrant.This line shows f of x = x minus 4 which has a slope of 1 and a y-intercept at -4.\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/0120bf1497785e3d10342ceca2ddf50bf6a0d285\"></p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n  <li> What is slope of each line? </li>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\">\n  <li> How can the parent function, \\(f(x)=x\\), be shifted to overlap \\(f(x)=x+2\\)?</li>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"4\">\n  <li> How can the parent function, \\(f(x)=x\\), be shifted to overlap \\(f(x)=x-4\\)?<br>\n    <br>\n  </li>\n  <li><br>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\\(f(x)=x+4\\) </li>\n      <li> \\(f(x)=x+2\\) </li>\n      <li> \\(f(x)=x\\) </li>\n      <li> \\(f(x)=x-2\\) </li>\n      <li> \\(f(x)=x-4\\) </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>What changed with these functions?
