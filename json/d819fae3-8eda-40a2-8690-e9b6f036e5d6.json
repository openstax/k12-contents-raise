Then, turn and talk to your partner. Check your answers when you are ready.\n    <ol type=\"a\">\n      <li> \\(\\sqrt[8]x\\) <br><br>\n        <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>\\(x^\\frac18\\)\n        <br>\n        <br>\n      </li>\n      <li> \\(\\sqrt[3]{x^2}\\) <br><br>\n        <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>\\(x^\\frac23\\)\n        <br>\n        <br>\n      </li>\n      <li> \\(\\sqrt[11]{x^5}\\) <br><br>\n        <strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>\\(x^\\frac5{11}\\)\n        <br>\n        <br>\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li>Now, with a partner, rewrite each term as an equivalent radical.

Allow students to make their own examples and then trade with other partner groups if time allows.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> First, have each pair write an example as a radical and switch with another pair. Then each pair writes the term with the rational exponent that matches their radical. </li>\n  <li> Have each pair write a term with a rational exponent and then switch with another pair. Each pair writes the term as a radical. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>5.2.3: Self Check</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION</strong><strong>:</strong></p>\n        <p>Rewrite \\(\\sqrt[10]{x^7}\\) as a term with a rational exponent.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x^\\frac{10}7\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incorrect.
