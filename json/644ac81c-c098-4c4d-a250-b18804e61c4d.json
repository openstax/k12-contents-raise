You learned that a strategy such as this might be difficult to use when the solutions are harder to find. </li>\n<li> 8.2.2: Self Check </li>\n<li> 8.2.2: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 8.2.3: Solving a Quadratic Equation Set Equal to Zero </li>\n<ul>\n<li> In this activity, you continued exploring how to solve quadratic equations. You learned that a quadratic equation that has been set equal to zero provides more opportunities for how to solve it. You set quadratic equations equal to zero when possible to find solutions in context. </li>\n<li> 8.2.3: Self Check </li>\n<li> 8.2.3: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 8.2.4: Solving a Real-World Problem Using Quadratic Equations </li>\n<ul>\n<li> In this activity, you solved a real-world problem using the skills learned in the lesson. By developing a better understanding of quadratic equations, you also better understand the context of a real-world situation. </li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> 8.2.5: Practice </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<!--pulldown-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n<p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<p>Correct!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!--Do not edit below line.-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n</div>"
