They also revisit how to set an appropriate graphing window.<br></p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Display the equation \\(B(x)=10x+25\\)&nbsp;for all to see. Ask students:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>&ldquo;How would you go about finding the value of \\(B(1.482)\\)?&rdquo; (Substitute 1.482 into the expression \\(10x+25\\)&nbsp;and evaluate, or use the graph of&nbsp;\\(y=10x+25\\)&nbsp;to estimate the \\(y\\)-value when \\(x\\)&nbsp;is 1.482.)</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;How would you find the value of&nbsp;\\(x\\) that makes \\(B(x)=103.75\\) true? Try solving the equation.\" (Solve&nbsp;\\(10x+25=103.75\\),&nbsp;or use the graph of&nbsp;\\(y=10x+25\\) to estimate the \\(x\\)-value when \\(y\\) is 103.75.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Explain that while it&rsquo;s possible to use a graph to find or estimate unknown input or output values, it is hard to be precise when using a hand-drawn or printed graph. We can evaluate the expression or solve the equation algebraically, but computing by hand can get cumbersome (though a calculator can take care of the most laborious part). Let's see how graphing technology can help us!</p>\n<p>The digital version of this activity includes instructions for using the Desmos Math Tool to graph an equation, change the graphing window, and find the output of a function for a given input. If students will be using different graphing technology, consider preparing alternate instructions.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Demonstrate how to graph&nbsp;\\(B(x)=10x+25\\),&nbsp;change the graphing window, and find&nbsp;\\(B(4)\\)&nbsp;on the graph.</li>\n  <li>Ask students to find the value of&nbsp;\\(x\\) when&nbsp;\\(B(x)\\)&nbsp;is 100. Then, demonstrate some ways (other than approximating visually) to solve for&nbsp;\\(x\\)&nbsp;given&nbsp;\\(B(x)=100\\):&nbsp;\n    <ol>\n      <li>Trace the line. Coordinates appear as we move along the line. Stop when the \\(y\\)-coordinate is 100 and see what the \\(x\\)-coordinate is.</li>\n      <li>Type \\(y=100\\)&nbsp;in the expression list. A horizontal line appears. Find the intersection of this line and the graph of&nbsp;\\(B\\).</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ask students to use one or both of these strategies to complete the activity.</p>\n<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n<div>\n  <em>Action and Expression: Provide Access for Physical Action.</em>&nbsp;Support effective and efficient use of tools and assistive technologies.

Invite groups to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using the graphing tool and to rehearse what they will say when they share with the whole class. Rehearsing provides students with additional opportunities to speak and clarify their thinking, and will improve the quality of explanations shared during the whole-class discussion.\n  </p>\n</div><br>\n<h3>4.5.4: Self Check</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"624\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" width=\"624\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>\n        <p>The function \\(D\\) is defined by the equation \\(D(x)=2.5x&nbsp;+12\\).</p>\n        <p dir=\"ltr\">Which describes the window that can be used to find the value of \\(x\\) when \\(D(x)=23.25\\) using graphing technology and gives the correct value of \\(x\\)?</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td valign=\"top\" width=\"312\">\n        <p align=\"center\"><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td valign=\"top\" width=\"312\">\n        <p align=\"center\"><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td valign=\"top\" width=\"312\">\n        <p>Graph \\(y=2.5x+12\\), \\(x=23.25\\); window: \\(x\\) from 0 to 30, \\(y\\) from 0 to 100; \\(x=70.125\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td valign=\"top\" width=\"312\">\n        <p>Incorrect.
