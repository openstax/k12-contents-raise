Statistical models can help the farmers they work with make decisions about how to sustain their farms. These farmers can use statistics to decide the amount of crops to grow to make a profit. They can use statistics relating to weather, climate, and rainfall.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In a previous course, you used statistics to investigate patterns of association in numerical data in two variables. In this section, you will learn how a linear model is used to describe the relationship between two variables. You will use scatter plots and lines of best fit to visualize numerical data in two variables. Technology will be used to compute the lines of best fit and to observe how well the linear models match the data. Residuals will be used to quantify the goodness of fit of the linear model.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This section includes 3 lessons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Linear Models</li>\n<li>Fitting Lines&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Residuals</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br></p>"
