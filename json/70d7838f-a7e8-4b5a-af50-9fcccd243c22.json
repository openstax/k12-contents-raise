Earlier in the unit, students learned that the zeros of a quadratic function are \\(x\\)-values that produce \\(y\\)-value of 0, and that the zeros of a function are the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the \\(x\\)-intercepts of the graph. This idea comes into focus in this activity.</p>\n<p>Note that in the examples given here, the \\(y\\)-coordinate of the \\(y\\)-intercept is always equal to the product of the zeros, but this is not the case with all graphs representing quadratic functions. (For example, graph representing \\(y=2x^2-8\\) intercepts the \\(x\\)-axis at 2 and &ndash; 2, but the \\(y\\)-intercept is \\((0,-8)\\).) If students make this observation, consider acknowledging that this seems to be true for these graphs and prompting students to revisit this observation in upcoming lessons (in which students will also study graphs) to see if it is always true.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Give students a few minutes of quiet time to complete the first two questions. Then, ask them to discuss their observations with a partner before completing the last question.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>Here are pairs of expressions in standard and factored forms.

Then, ask them to share their predictions for the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-intercepts of the graph of function \\(p\\), defined by \\((x-9)(x-1)\\). Discuss with students:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> &ldquo;How did you find the \\(x\\)-intercept of the graph of function \\(p\\) without graphing?&rdquo; (By looking at the intercepts in other graphs with similar factors. In the examples, expressions of the form \\((x-a)(x-b)\\) have \\((a,0)\\) and \\((b,0)\\) for the \\(x\\)-intercepts.) </li>\n  <li> The \\(x\\)-intercept occurs when \\(y\\) is zero. So for \\((x+3)(x+1)\\) to equal zero, one of the factors has to be zero (if \\(ab=0\\), then \\(a=0\\) or \\(b=0\\)). So if \\(x+3=0\\), then \\(x= &ndash; 3\\). If \\(x+1=0\\), then \\(x=-1\\). This prepares students for problems like \\((3x+2)(x-1)\\), where the zeros will be \\(&ndash;\\frac23\\) and 1. </li>\n  <li> &ldquo;How did you find the \\(y\\)-intercept?&rdquo; (By writing the expression in the standard form and seeing what the constant term is. By evaluating the expression at \\(x=0\\).) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Demonstrate graphing \\(p(x)=(x-9)(x-1)\\) using the technology available in your classroom. Point to the intercepts. If using Desmos, show students that you can click on the intercepts to reveal the coordinates of the points.</p>\n<p>Remind students that earlier in the unit we learned that the \\(x\\)-intercepts of a graph tell us the zeros of the function, or the input values that produce an output of 0. Highlight that, because an expression in factored form can tell us about the \\(x\\)-intercept of the graph, this form is also handy for telling us about the zeros of the function that the expression represents.</p>\n<p>At this point, students are just noticing that numbers in the expression have something to do with intercepts on the graph. Tell students that, in the next lesson, we will explore why they are related.</p>\n<h3>7.10.3: Self Check&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><em><strong>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</strong></em></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n        <p>What are the \\(x\\)-values of the \\(x\\)-intercept(s) of&nbsp;</p>\n        <p>\\(y=(x-9)(x+2)\\)?</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x = 2, x = &ndash; 9\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incorrect.
