In this activity, they deepen that understanding by explaining why, if a given equation is true for a certain value of the variable, performing one of those moves leads to a second equation that is also true for the same variable value. This requires more than simply stating what the moves are, and it offers students opportunities to construct logical arguments.</p>\n<p>Clarify the distinction with an example. Ask students: &ldquo;Consider these equations: <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 3x - 5 = 16 \\)</span> and <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 3x = 21 \\)</span>. The first equation is a true statement for a certain value of <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( x \\)</span>. Can you explain why the second equation must also be true for the same value of <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( x \\)</span>?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Explain that an answer such as &ldquo;Adding 5 to each side of the first equation gives the second equation&rdquo; is a description of the move rather than an explanation for why the second equation must be true.</p>\n<p>An explanation may sound something like: &ldquo;We know that <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 3x-5 \\)</span> and 16 are equal when <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( x \\)</span> has a particular value. If we add the same number, like 5, to both <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 3x-5 \\)</span> and 16, the results are still equal for the same variable value. This means the statement <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 3x = 21 \\)</span> must be true for the same value of <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( x \\)</span>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In this partner activity, students take turns giving explanations and listening to and critiquing a partner&rsquo;s explanations. As students discuss their thinking, listen for explanations that are particularly clear so that they can be shared with the class later.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Launch</h3>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<p>Tell students that they have performed a number of moves to write equivalent equations and solve equations. They will now practice explaining to a partner why those moves are legitimate. Demonstrate what it means to explain or defend the steps rather than simply describing them, as shown in the Activity Narrative.</p>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Ask the partners in each group to choose different equations from each column. Give students a few minutes of quiet time to think about and write explanations about the equations in column A. Then, give students time to take turns sharing their explanations with their partner before moving on to column B.</p>\n<p>Tell students that when one student explains, the partner&rsquo;s job is to listen and make sure that they agree and that the explanation makes sense. If they don&rsquo;t agree, the partners discuss until they come to an agreement.</p>\n<p>Repeat the process with the equations in column B.</p>\n<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>\n<div>\n<p><em>Conversing: MLR8 Discussion Supports. </em>Display the following sentence frames for all to see: &ldquo;_____ and _____ are both true because . . .&rdquo; and &ldquo;I noticed _____ and _____ are not equivalent because . . .&rdquo; Encourage students to challenge each other when they disagree.

If <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 4(9-x) \\)</span> is equal to 16, then <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 36-4x \\)</span> is also equal to 16.</li>\n<li>If the two sides of the equation are equal, then they are still equal if the same amount, in this case <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 2x \\)</span>, is subtracted from each side.</li>\n<li>\n<span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( -3(2x +9) \\)</span> divided by \\(-3\\) is <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 2x+9 \\),</span> and 12 divided by \\(-3\\) is \\(-4\\). Because <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\(-3(2x +9) \\)</span> is equal to 12, dividing each of them by \\(-3\\) gives the same result, so it is true that <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 2x+9 \\)</span> is equal to <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( -4 \\)</span>.\n            </li>\n<li>Subtracting a number is equivalent to adding its opposite, so <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 3 - x \\)</span> is equivalent to <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 3 + (- x) \\)</span>.

If <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 5x \\)</span> is equal to <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 3+ (-x) \\)</span>, then it is also equal to <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( -x +3 \\)</span>.</li>\n<li>Using the commutative property, <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 3x - 6 + x \\)</span> can be rewritten as <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 3x + x - 6 \\)</span>.

If not already clear from students&rsquo; explanations, emphasize that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If two expressions are equal, then performing the same addition (or subtraction) or multiplication (or division) to both expressions maintains the equality.</li>\n<li>Applying the distributive, commutative, and associative properties (of multiplication or addition) to an expression doesn&rsquo;t change its value, so doing so to one side of a true equation doesn&rsquo;t change the equality.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Explain to students that next they will look at some examples where the moves made to write equivalent equations appear to be acceptable but the resulting equations turn out to be false statements.</p>\n<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n<div>\n<p><em>Representation: Internalize Comprehension.</em> Use color and annotations to illustrate student thinking.

Know that you learn more from wrong answers than from right\n                answers! Wrong answers help us find flaws in our thinking. Take a minute\n                to think about <em>why</em> you got the question wrong. Then you won&rsquo;t get this type of question wrong again!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"
