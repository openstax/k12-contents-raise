When given a function&rsquo;s solutions, factored form, or standard form, you will be able to identify key information about the function.</p>\n<p>You will understand what it means for two quadratic functions to be related. Given its solutions and one point, you will be able to specifically identify a specific quadratic function. You will use the skills you have learned to write a quadratic function satisfying the particular parameters given.</p>\n<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Find the standard form of a quadratic function given its zeros. </li>\n  <li> Find the standard form of a quadratic function given its graph. </li>\n  <li> Use the intercept form of a quadratic function to define a specific function given its zeros and a point. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> 8.11.1: Relating a Quadratic Function and Its Zeros </li>\n  <li> 8.11.2: Finding a Quadratic Function from Its Zeros </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> 8.11.2: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 8.11.2: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 8.11.3: Finding a Quadratic Function from Its Zeros and a Point </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> 8.11.3: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 8.11.3: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 8.11.4: Writing Quadratics When Given Any Format </li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that, you'll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> 8.11.5: Practice </li>\n  <li> 8.11.6: Lesson Summary </li>\n</ul>"
