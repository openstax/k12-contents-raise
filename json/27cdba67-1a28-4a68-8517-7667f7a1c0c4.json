The thickness of the frame is represented by \\(x\\), in inches. The equation \\(y = (2x + 8)(2x + 10)\\) relates these two variables.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n<li>What is the width, or shorter side, of the picture without the frame?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 8 inches</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n<li>What is the length, or longer side, of the picture without the frame?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 10 inches</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\">\n<li>What would a solution to the equation \\(100 = (2x + 8)(2x + 10)\\) mean in this situation?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The solution would represent the thickness of a frame that results in a total area of 100 square inches.</p>\n<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>\n<h5>More Chances</h5>\n<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>"
