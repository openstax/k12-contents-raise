In this lesson, students build on those understandings to find the solutions to systems of linear inequalities in two variables.</p>\n<p>Students learn that two linear inequalities that represent the constraints in the same situation form a system of inequalities, and that the solutions to the system include all numbers that satisfy both constraints simultaneously. Graphically, the solution set of the system is represented by the region where the graphs of the individual inequalities overlap.</p>\n<p>Throughout the lesson, students endeavor to find values that satisfy multiple constraints, in both mathematical and real-world contexts. The process requires that students make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)&nbsp;</h4>\n<p><span>Students will be able to:</span><br></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Identify values that satisfy each constraint and those that satisfy both constraints simultaneously, given descriptions and graphs that represent two constraints.</li>\n  <li>Explain that the solution set of a system of inequalities in two variables is comprised of any pair of values that make both inequalities true, and that it is represented graphically by the region where the graphs overlap.</li>\n  <li>Write systems of inequalities in two variables, use technology to graph the solutions, and interpret the solutions in context.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>Write a system of inequalities to describe a situation, find the solution by graphing, and interpret points in the solution.</li>\n  <li>Explain what is meant by &ldquo;the solutions to a system of inequalities&rdquo; and describe the graphs that represent the solutions.</li>\n  <li>Find values that satisfy each constraint individually, and values that satisfy both constraints at once, when given descriptions and graphs that represent two different constraints.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<div align=\"left\">\n  <table>\n    <colgroup>\n      <col>\n      <col>\n    </colgroup>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p>A3(H) graph the solution set of systems of two linear inequalities in two variables on the coordinate plane.</p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</div>\n<h4><br></h4>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>2.13.1: Modeling Equations to Solve a Riddle</li>\n  <li>2.13.2: Finding a Pair of Values that Satisfies Multiple Inequalities</li>\n  <li>2.13.2: Self Check</li>\n  <li>2.13.3: Writing Systems of Inequalities that Represent Situations</li>\n  <li>2.13.3: Self Check</li>\n  <li>2.13.4: Graphing Solutions of Systems of Inequalities</li>\n  <li>2.13.5: Writing Inequalities for Situations and Representing on a Graph</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 2.13.6: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>Graphing technology</li>\n  <li>Optional: notecards</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<p>Acquire devices that can run Desmos (recommended) or other graphing technology.
