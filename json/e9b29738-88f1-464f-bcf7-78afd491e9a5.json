Using the slope and a point, you wrote equations in point-slope form and slope-intercept form.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> 1.13.2: Writing an Equation of a Line Parallel to a Given Line<ul>\n<li>In this activity, you explored parallel lines that have the same slope. You also wrote the equation of lines parallel to given lines that went through a specific point.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> 1.13.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li> 1.13.3: Writing an Equation of a Line Perpendicular to a Given Line<ul>\n<li>In this activity, you explored perpendicular lines that have slopes that are opposite reciprocals of each other. You wrote the equations of lines that were perpendicular to a given line and went through a specific point.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> 1.13.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li> 1.13.4: Writing an Equation of a Line Parallel or Perpendicular to an Axis<ul>\n<li>In this activity, you wrote equations of lines parallel or perpendicular to an axis through a given point, given a line in the form \\(x = a\\) or \\(y =b\\).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> 1.13.4: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li> 1.13.5: Drawing Parallel and Perpendicular Lines<ul>\n<li>In this activity, you worked with a partner to draw parallel and perpendicular lines on a coordinate plane.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><span>1.13.6: Practice</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<!--Q1-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n<p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<p>Correct!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!----------------- Must be included at the bottom of page for dropdown to work ------------>\n<!--Do not edit below line.-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n</div>"
