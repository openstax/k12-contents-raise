She spent a total of $128 on admission to both places. Last month, she went to the pool 3 times and the skating rink 4 times. Last month she spent $83 on admission to both places.</p>\n<p>Let \\(p\\)&nbsp;represent the cost of the pool and \\(s\\)&nbsp;represent the cost of the skating\n  rink.</p>\n<p><u>This Month</u><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Last Month</u></span></p>\n<p>\\(8p\n  + 4s = 128\\) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \\(3p\n  + 4s = 83\\)</p>\n<p>So, this system represents the constraints in this situation:</p>\n<p>\\(\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}8p+4s=128\\\\\\;3p+4s=83\\end{array}\\right.\\)</p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Over both months, she went to the pool 11 times and the skating rink 8 times. She spent a total of \\($128 + $83\\), or \\($211\\), over both months.</span></p>\n\n<p>The equation that represents this total is \\(11p + 8s = 211\\). Notice this is the equivalent of adding the like terms of the two equations in the system of equations.</p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Let&rsquo;s\n    solve the original system and determine if the solution also applies to this\n    new equation.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Using\n    substitution, we find that the solution is \\((9, 14)\\), or the pool costs $9 and\n    the skating rink costs $14.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Substitute\n    these values into the new equation:</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\\(11p + 8s = 211\\)</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">\\(11(9) + 8(14) = 211\\)</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\\(99 + 112 = 211\\)</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\\(211 = 211\\)&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">&checkmark;</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Adding\n    the equations together produces a new equation that has the same solution.</span></p>\n<h4><span lang=\"EN\">Try It: </span><span lang=\"EN\">Adding\n    Two Equations in a Real-World Situation</span></h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"eventnameX\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-content\">\n<p>Alicia is a chef for a restaurant.
