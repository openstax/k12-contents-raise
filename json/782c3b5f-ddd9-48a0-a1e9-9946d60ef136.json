Here, they reason the other way around: they write equations that can be represented by given graphs. To do so, students need to apply their insights about the structure of quadratic expressions in different forms and their connections to the graphs.</p>\n<p>To help students write and check their equations, at least three points on each graph are labeled with their coordinates. In some cases, it is easier to write an equation in factored form. In other cases, an equation in standard form can be more easily derived. Identify students who are attentive to the information given in the graph and use it strategically. Invite them to share during discussion.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Provide access to graphing technology.</p>\n<p>The activity allows for instant feedback to students (if an equation is incorrect, the graph that results will not match the given graph). Because the equations increase in complexity as students move from Graph A to Graph J, students may find that their equations are off but not know what the issue is or how to correct them. Consider arranging students in groups of two so that they can discuss how to write the more-challenging equations.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity </h4>\n<p>Use the graphing tool or technology outside the course.

Highlight explanations such as:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> When the graph opens up, the \\(x^2\\) term in standard form has a positive coefficient. When it opens down, the \\(x^2\\) term has a negative coefficient. </li>\n  <li> When two \\(x\\)-intercepts are known, we can write the equations in factored form. </li>\n  <li> When the \\(y\\)-intercept is not at \\((0,0)\\) and the graph is centered on the \\(y\\)-axis, the equation in standard form will have the form of \\(ax^2+c\\) (no linear term) and \\((0,c)\\) is the \\(y\\)-intercept. (A linear term would have shifted the graph horizontally as well as vertically so it would not be centered on the \\(y\\)-axis.) </li>\n  <li> When \\((0,0)\\) is the only \\(x\\)-intercept, the \\(y\\)-intercept, and the vertex, the equation in standard form has only the squared term \\((ax^2)\\). If there was a linear term, the graph would not be centered on the \\(y\\)-axis. If there was a constant term, the graph would move up or down and either cross the \\(x\\)-axis in two places or not cross it at all (that is, there would be two \\(x\\)-intercepts or none). </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Consider discussing Graph F, as it is unlike most graphs students have seen so far (it has only one \\(x\\)-intercept at \\((2,0)\\) and one \\(y\\)-intercept that is not at the origin). Here a couple of approaches:</p>\n<p>Help students see that the factored form is still useful here. Students may guess that (\\(x-2)\\) is one of the factors (because multiplying any number by \\(2-2\\) would give an output of 0) but may be unsure about the second factor. Point out that the second factor is also \\((x-2)\\) because there is no other \\(x\\)-intercept. Expanding \\((x-2)(x-2)\\) into standard form gives \\(x^2-4x+4\\), which allows us to see that the \\(y\\)-intercept is \\((0,4)\\).</p>\n<p>If we shift this graph down 4 units, it will intercept the \\(x\\)-axis at 0 and 4 and its equation would be \\(y=x(x-4)\\) or \\(y=x^2-4x\\) (per what we learned earlier). To arrive at the Graph F, we would have to move it back up 4, making the equation \\(x^2-4x+4\\).</p>\n<h3>7.13.3: Self Check</h3>\n<em><strong>\n    <p>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</p>\n  </strong></em> <br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>\n        <p>Which equation describes the graph below?</p>\n        <p><img alt=\"GRAPH OF A PARABOLA THAT OPENS UPWARD WITH A Y-INTERCEPT OF NEGATIVE 12 AND X-INTERCEPTS OF NEGATIVE 4 AND 3.\" class=\"img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom\" height=\"305\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/8294df97d712ac90b9f784606574463ca3db4d6f\" width=\"300\"></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(f(x) = (x + 3)(x - 4)\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incorrect.
