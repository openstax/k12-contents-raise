In previous lessons, students found a quadratic function that has certain zeros in its simplest standard form. In this activity, students will find a more specific quadratic function using the given point.</p>\n<p>This is accomplished by using the intercept form, \\(f(x) = a(x &minus; p)(x &minus; q)\\), of a quadratic equation. The roots of the function and the given point are substituted into the function to find the value of \\(a\\). This value of the multiplier, \\(a\\), is then distributed through the equation to find the specific quadratic equation that meets our given criteria.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>In this activity, questions 1&ndash;3 provide a step-through introduction to finding the specific equation of a quadratic equation that has certain zeros and passes through a given point. Give students time to complete the first three questions and then pause for a class discussion.</p>\n<p>While discussing the first three questions, emphasize that the function \\(m(x) = x^2&minus; 3x &minus; 40\\) is a function that has the zeros &ndash;5 and 8. As we found in question 3, \\(m(x) = 2x^2&minus; 6x &minus; 80\\) is another function that has the zeros &ndash;5 and 8. Only the function \\(m(x) = 2x^2&minus; 6x &minus; 80\\) passes through the point \\((5, -60)\\) and is the specific function we want. Show the graphs of these two functions using <a href=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/0107b2bfda94c3432e1996a46a5cbfad3035b0cf\" target=\"_blank\">Desmos</a> to help visualize the difference between these two quadratic equations. Emphasize that these quadratic equations are related since they both have the same zeros and axis of symmetry (\\(x = 1.5)\\). Only one of them, however, passes through the point \\((5, -60)\\).</p>\n<p>Allow students to complete questions 4&ndash;6 in pairs.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>When finding an exact function that has particular zeros and passes through a certain point, we use the intercept form of a quadratic function:</p>\n<p>\\(f(x) = a(x &minus; p)(x &minus; q)\\)</p>\n<p>The variables \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) represent the zeros or roots of the function.
