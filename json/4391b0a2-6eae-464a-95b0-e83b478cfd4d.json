This value can be used to calculate everything from the maximum profit from ticket sales to the minimum price charged for a ticket that will still make money for the theater. With quadratic functions, the vertex is where the maximum or minimum value is located. Writing quadratic expressions in vertex form helps to easily locate the vertex and thus the maximum or minimum value.</p>\n<p>In this unit, you will rewrite quadratic expressions in vertex form and then use these expressions to solve problems. These problems include finding the ticket price to create the maximum revenue for a theater performance or concert as well as finding the perfect price of a newspaper subscription to create the maximum revenue.</p>\n<p>This section includes two lessons, plus an optional lesson:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> Rewriting Quadratic Expressions in Vertex Form </li>\n<li> Using Quadratic Expressions in Vertex Form to Solve Problems </li>\n<li> Deriving the Quadratic Formula (Optional) </li>\n</ul>"
