Record students&rsquo; reasoning for all to see. In particular, highlight observations about common differences and common ratios. Ask questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>&ldquo;Besides evaluating the expression, how could you tell (a certain expression) matched one of the situations?&rdquo;</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;How could you tell (a certain table) matched one of the situations?&rdquo;</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;How is the number of followers growing every 2 years?&rdquo;</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;How is the amount of water in the tank increasing every 2 minutes?&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<h5> Support for English Language Learners</h5>\n<div>\n  <p> Use this routine to support whole-class discussion. For each observation that is shared, ask students to restate what they heard using precise mathematical language. Consider providing students time to restate what they hear to a partner before selecting one or two students to share with the class. Ask the original speaker if their peer was accurately able to restate their thinking. Call students&rsquo; attention to any words or phrases that helped clarify the original statement. This provides more students with an opportunity to produce language as they interpret the reasoning of others.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n<div>\n  <p>Use color coding and annotations to highlight important connections between the text of each situation and the corresponding tables and expressions. Begin by asking students what they noticed to help identify how common differences and common factors appear in each representation.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>5.3.4: Self Check&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Following the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION: </strong></p>\n        <p>Which of the following is <strong>NOT</strong> an example of a way to represent a chain of stores that currently has 4 stores but plans to double the number of stores they have each year for the next 5 years?</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incorrect.

In both scenarios, the initial value or starting point is 5 stores, which is why in each table the first value is \\((0,5)\\). If they are opening 20 additional stores each year, they are adding 20 stores to the total from the previous year. So in year 1 there would be 25 total stores, in year 2 there would be 45 total stores, and so on. These values are represented in option 6, so option 6 would represent Plan A. </li>\n  <li> The mathematical expressions contain either multiplication or addition. Plan A is ADDING 20 stores a year, so year 5 could be represented as option 1 because it would be the initial number of stores plus 20 per year for 5 years, or \\(5 +20+20+20+20+20\\).&nbsp; </li>\n  <li> Option 5 is also added, and it represents Plan A since \\(5 +20+20+20+20+20\\) is the same as \\(5+100\\). </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at Plan B.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Plan B would also start at 5, but it says to double the number of stores each year. Double means to MULTIPLY by 2, so it would be \\(5 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2\\), which is option 3.&nbsp; </li>\n  <li> Since \\(5 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2\\) can be simplified to \\(5 \\cdot 32\\), option 2 also represents Plan B.</li>\n  <li> Option 4 is the other table option, and as mentioned before, each table should have an initial value of 5 stores. Since Plan B is to double the number of stores, at the end of year 1 there should be 10 stores. When you check option 4, you can see that each term is double the term before. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Therefore Plan A is options 1, 5, and 6, and Plan B is options 2, 3, and 4.</p>\n<h4> Try It: Multiple Representations Verbal Scenario</h4>\n<p>Represent the following scenario as a table and as two different mathematical expressions:</p>\n<p>A tank contains 80 gallons of water and is getting filled at a rate of 3 gallons per minute.
