The context is a familiar one, allowing students to focus their reasoning on domain and range.</p>\n<p>Unlike in the activity about a child on a swing, the graph includes a scale on each axis and the coordinate pairs of some points, allowing students to identify the range more definitively. However, the graph is a partial representation of the function because it does not show what happens after a dropped ball hits the ground the fifth time. When describing the domain, students need to attend to what is reasonable in this situation (that is, noting that the ball likely does not just stop after the fifth bounce).</p>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement </h4>\n<p>A tennis ball was dropped from a certain height. It bounced several times, rolled along for a short period, and then stopped. Function \\(H\\) gives its height over time.</p>\n<p>Here is a partial graph of \\(H\\). Height is measured in feet. Time is measured in seconds.</p>\n<p>Use the graph to help you answer the questions.</p>\n<p>Be prepared to explain what each value or set of values means in this situation.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Nonlinear function. Time (seconds) and height (feet).\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/f263631beed5c32faad860eada6777c68e83f3b9\"></p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Find \\(H(0)\\). What point is this on the graph? What does it represent?</li>\n  <li> Solve \\(H(x)=0\\). </li>\n  <li> Describe the domain of the function. </li>\n  <li> Describe the range of the function. </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> \\(H(0)=6\\). It tells us the ball was dropped from a height of 6 feet at \\(t=0\\). </li>\n  <li> \\(x=0.54\\), \\(x=1.48\\), and \\(x=2.25\\) are three possible solutions, but there are others. Each one represents the time when the ball hit the ground. </li>\n  <li> For example: The domain includes all values between 0 and the time when the ball stopped moving, which, based on the graph, is about 3.8. </li>\n  <li> For example: The range includes all values between 0 and 6 feet, the height from which the ball was dropped. </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Video: Interpreting Function Notation</h4>\n<p>Watch the following video to learn more about function notation.</p>\n<video controls=\"true\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" width=\"550\">\n  <source src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/20f903eb50ca52bd9b9bfa4a7db8be6af298e6be\">\n  <track default=\"true\" kind=\"captions\" label=\"On\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/f67996d2238d2d8b26549d8065f6ae3382299f62\" srclang=\"en_us\">\n  https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/20f903eb50ca52bd9b9bfa4a7db8be6af298e6be\n</video>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h4>Student-Facing Extension</h4>\n<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>\n<p>In function \\(H\\), the input was time in seconds, and the output was height in feet.</p>\n<p>Think about some other quantities that could be inputs or outputs in this situation.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Describe a function whose domain includes only integers.

Highlight explanations that account for what is realistic in the context.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> The domain tells us all the possible amounts of time that passed since the moment the tennis ball was dropped until it stopped rolling. </li>\n  <li> The range includes all the possible heights of the tennis ball from the time it was dropped until the time it stopped rolling. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ask students if there are points on the graph whose coordinates are particularly useful for identifying the domain and range of the function. (The heights of the bounces? The points where the ball hits the ground? Points between the two? Others?)</p>\n<p>Emphasize that, just like in the activity about the swing, some points and features on a graph can give us more information than others about possible input-output values of a function.</p>\n<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>\n<div>\n  <p> Use this routine to support whole-class discussion of the meaning of domain and range in the context of a tennis ball bouncing. As students share explanations of their reasoning about the domain and the range for the function, encourage students to press for details and precision in language in peers&lsquo; responses by asking questions such as, &ldquo;Can you explain this using points on the graph?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Are there values for the domain and range not shown on the graph? How do you know?&rdquo;</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h3>4.12.3: Self Check&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:&nbsp; </strong></p>\n        <p>The graph below shows the number of customers, \\(C\\), in a restaurant \\(x\\) hours after 8 a.m.</p>\n        <p>What does \\(C(14)\\) equal, and what does it mean?</p>\n        <p><img alt=\"A GRAPHED FUNCTION, WHERE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS IS A FUNCTION OF THE NUMBER OF HOURS AFTER 8 AM.
