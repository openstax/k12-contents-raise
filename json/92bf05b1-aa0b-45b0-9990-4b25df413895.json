It also introduces how one linear function can be shifted to another.</p>\n<p>Later in the lesson, students will graph linear functions only using knowledge of transformations to prepare them for later units when they graph other functions with transformations.</p>\n<p>For students who can benefit from a more accessible model, use geoboards and rubber bands. Use one color rubber band for the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-axes. Use a different color for each line graphed. Work with students to count spots on the geoboard and discuss the graphs and their relationships.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Allow students to compare their graphs with their partners and discuss the relationships of the lines.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>\n<p>On your coordinate grid, use the slope and \\(y\\)-intercept of each equation to graph each equation.</p>\n<p>Use a different color for each equation.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\\(y=3x +4\\) </li>\n  <li> \\(y=3x - 2\\) </li>\n  <li> \\(y=\\frac13 x +1\\) </li>\n  <li> \\(y=-\\frac13 x -3\\) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Use the graphing tool here or technology outside the course. </p>\n<br>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-desmos-gc\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\"></div>\n<br>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n  <li> What is the relationship between lines \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? </li>\n  <li> What is the relationship between lines \\(b\\) and \\(d\\)? </li>\n  <li> How many vertical spaces are between lines \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<img alt class=\"img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom\" height=\"259\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/9dffaf5b66ae086e83cf65d60c4925736c285798\" width=\"300\"><br>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n  <li> They are parallel lines. </li>\n  <li> They are perpendicular lines. </li>\n  <li> 6 </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Invite students to share their interpretations of the given equations and the new equations they wrote. Then, discuss with students:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>&ldquo;Do you notice any other relationships between pairs of lines?&rdquo;</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;How many vertical spaces are between lines \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)?&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>"
