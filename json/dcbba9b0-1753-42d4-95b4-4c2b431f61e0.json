In this activity, students continue to connect graphical and verbal representations of a function, applying the mathematical terms they learned. They also connect each feature (described in words and on the graph) to an expression or equation that could represent it mathematically, written in function notation.</p>\n<p>During the activity synthesis, students learn to distinguish between a maximum or minimum of a graph (relative maximum or minimum) and the maximum or minimum of a function (absolute maximum or minimum). Students see that a maximum of a graph refers to a point on a graph that is as high as or higher than all other points, while the maximum of a function is a function value that is equal to or greater than all other values of that function.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Give students a few minutes of quiet think time, and then time to discuss their response with their partner.</p>\n<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>\n<div>\n  <p>As students share their matches and explain their reasoning to their partner, display the following sentence frames for all to see: \"_____ matches _____ because . . .\", \"I noticed _____ , so I matched . . .\", and \"The strategy that I used was . . . .\" Encourage students to challenge each other when they disagree. While monitoring discussions, amplify student ideas to demonstrate use of mathematical language such as \"first peak\", \"maximum\", \"minimum\", or \"vertical intercept.\" This routine will help students connect graphical and verbal representations of a function through partner discussions.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement </h4>\n<p>In a bungee jump, the height of the jumper is a function of time since the jump begins.</p>\n<h4><img alt=\"Woman bungee jumping.\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/bf4ed348b88f95d7a3a03503ff3ac5a00bc30321\" width=\"300\"></h4>\n<p>Function h defines the height, in meters, of a jumper above a river, \\(t\\) seconds since leaving the platform.</p>\n<p>Here is a graph of function h, followed by five expressions or equations and five graphical features.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Graph of curve.

Make an estimate and explain your reasoning.</p>\n<h4>Extension Student Response</h4>\n<p>For example: About 50 meters. The low points on the graph increase with each bounce and the high points decrease. They look like they are approaching about 30 meters in height above the river. Since the jump started from 80 meters above the river, this means that the bungee cord is about 50 meters long.</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Have students pair up to share how they made their matches and how they interpreted the expression or equation without a matching verbal description. The teacher should circulate checking answers and listening for outliers.&nbsp; Have students share the different responses if time or just share outliers with whole class.</p>\n<p>Make sure students can interpret \\(h(t)=0\\) to mean that the jumper is no longer in the air and is in fact on the surface of the water. Because the graph has no horizontal intercept, and because no verbal descriptions to this effect were given, we know \\(h(t)=0\\) had no match.</p>\n<p>Next, ask students to share their response to the last set of questions. Discuss with students why \\(h(t)=0\\) has no solutions based on the information we have. It is possible that, if the graph is extended to include more time, we might see a representation of the jumper somehow reaching the water. But given the graph as is, it doesn't have a solution.</p>\n<p>This is a good time to introduce the distinction between a maximum (or minimum) of a graph and the maximum (or minimum) of a function. Ask students,</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\"What is the greatest value of function h?\" (80)</li>\n  <li>\"How do we know that 80 is the greatest, or that \\(h(t)\\) could not have greater values?\" (The jumper could not be higher than the jumping platform.)</li>\n  <li>\"What is the least value of function h?\" (about 10, based on the graph)</li>\n  <li>\"How do we know that 10 is the least value, or that \\(h(t)\\) could not have lesser values?\" (We don't. The jumper could go lower, say, if lowered into a receiving boat, or if released into the river.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Explain that, in this case, the graph has one maximum, or one point that is higher than all the other points, and it coincides with the maximum of the function, which is the greatest value of the function.</p>\n<p>The graph also has a minimum, \\((4,h(4))\\), which is lower than all other points shown on the graph, but this point does not represent the minimum of the function, or the lowest value the function could have. The function h could have 0 as its minimum (or a negative value if the jumper goes diving), but as far as the given graph is concerned, \\((4,10)\\) is a minimum.</p>\n<p>Emphasize that a maximum (or minimum) of a graph is a point, and it gets labeled as such relative to other points visible on the graph. The maximum (or minimum) of a function, however, is a value that is the greatest (or least) for any input.</p>\n<h3>4.6.3: Self Check&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n        <p>The graph models the height, in feet, of a kickball over time.
