These characteristics included \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-intercepts. </li>\n    <li> 7.10.2: Self-Check </li>\n    <li> 7.10.2: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 7.10.3: The \\(X\\)- and \\(Y\\)-Intercepts of Quadratic Expressions </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> In this activity, you continued looking at different forms and graphs of quadratics and identifying their intercepts. You then made observations about how the graphs and forms are related in helping identify intercepts. </li>\n    <li> 7.10.3: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 7.10.3: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 7.10.4: Using the Standard Form of an Equation to Find the \\(X\\)- and \\(Y\\)-Intercepts </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> In this activity, you used the standard form of a quadratic equation to find the \\(y\\)-intercept and the factored form of the same equation to find the \\(x\\)-intercepts. </li>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following<strong> practice:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 7.10.5: Practice </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <!--pulldown-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n      <p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n      <p>Correct!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n      <p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!--Do not edit below line.-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n</div>"
