They begin with linear equations, move toward a series of quadratic expressions in factored form, and end with a cubic expression in factored form. The progression prompts students to reason about the parts and structure of the expressions, rather than to memorize steps for solving without understanding.</p>\n<p>As students discuss their reasoning with their partner, listen for those who invoke the zero product property to explain how the last four equations could be solved, and those who notice a pattern in how the equations could be solved. (Though the last question involves a cubic equation, solving it involves the same reasoning as solving quadratic expressions.)</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Tell students to work quietly and answer at least half of the questions before discussing their thinking with a partner.</p>\n<p>If needed, remind students that some equations have more than one solution. Because we want students to use reasoning and the structure of equations to develop their solutions, discourage use of graphing technology in this activity.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity </h4>\n<p>For each equation, find its solution or solutions. Be prepared to explain your reasoning.</p>\n<p>For questions 1&ndash;3, review the process of solving equations.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>\\(x&minus;3=0\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(x=3\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n  <li>\\(x+11=0\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(x=-11\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\">\n  <li>\\(2x+11=0\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(x=\\frac {-11}{2}\\)</p>\n<p>For questions 4&ndash;7, recall the zero product property means that each (or all) of the factors could be equal to zero when their product is zero.

The <em>only</em> factor pairs of 48 that are 8 units apart are 4 and 12, as well as &ndash;4 and &ndash;12.</p>\n<p>Think:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> What value of \\(x\\) would make the factors \\((x&minus;3)(x+5)\\) equivalent to \\((4)(12)\\)? \\(x=7\\). </li>\n  <li> What value of \\(x\\) would make the factors \\((x&minus;3)(x+5)\\) equivalent to \\((-4)(-12)\\)? \\(x=-9\\). </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> If \\(x=7\\), then \\((x&minus;3)(x+5) = 4 \\cdot 12\\). </li>\n  <li> If \\(x=-9\\), then \\((x&minus;3)(x+5)=-12 \\cdot (-4)\\). </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>\n<p>Students may incorrectly think that \\(x\\) can represent a different value in each factor in an equation. For example, upon finding \\(x=-11\\) and \\(x=3\\) as solutions to \\((x&minus;3)(x+11)=0\\), they think that one solution is for the \\(x\\) in \\((x&minus;3)\\) and the other for the \\(x\\) in \\((x&minus;11)\\).</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Remind students that solving the equation \\((x&minus;3)(x+11)=0\\) is like finding the zeros of the function defined by \\((x&minus;3)(x &minus;11)\\). Although there may be two values of \\(x\\) that lead to 0 for the value of \\((x&minus;3)(x&minus;11)\\), only one input can be entered into the function at a time. Ask students to substitute the solutions into the equations and check if the expression is equal to 0 each time. </li>\n  <li> When \\(x = -11\\), the value of the expression is \\((-11&minus;3)(-11+11)\\) or \\((-14)(0)\\), which is 0. </li>\n  <li> When \\(x=3\\), the value of the expression is \\((3&minus;3)(3+11)\\) or \\((0)(14)\\), which is 0. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Invite students to share their strategies for solving the nonlinear equations. As they explain, record and organize each step of their reasoning process and display for all to see.</p>\n<p>For example, the equation \\((x&minus;3)(2x+11)=0\\) tells us that if the product of \\((x&minus;3)\\) and \\((2x + 11)\\) is 0, then either \\(x&minus;3\\) is equal to 0 or \\(2x+11\\) is equal to 0. We can then organize the rest of the solving process as:</p>\n<p>If \\(x&minus;3\\) is equal to 0, then \\(x\\) is 3.</p>\n<p>\\(\\begin{array}{rcl}x-3&amp;=&amp;0\\\\x&amp;=&amp;3\\end{array}\\)</p>\n<p>If \\(2x+11\\) is equal to 0, then \\(x=\\frac {-11}{2}\\).</p>\n<p> \\(\\begin{array}{rcl}2x+11&amp;=&amp;0\\\\2x&amp;=&amp;-11\\\\x&amp;=&amp;\\frac{-11}2\\end{array}\\)</p>\n<p>The equation is true when \\(x=3\\) and when \\(x=\\frac {-11}{2}\\).</p>\n<p>Emphasize that because at least one of the factors must be 0 for the product to be 0, we can write each expression that is a factor as equal to 0 and solve each of these equations separately.</p>\n<p>Remind students that we can check our solutions by substituting each one back into the equation and seeing if the equation remains true. Although the two factors, \\((x&minus;3)\\) and \\((2x&minus;11)\\), won't be 0 simultaneously when 3 or \\(\\frac {- 11}{2}\\) is substituted for \\(x\\), the expression on the left side of the equation will have a value of 0 because one of the factors is 0.</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> When \\(x\\) is 3, the expression is \\((3&minus;3)(2(3)+11)\\) or \\((0)(17)\\), which is 0. </li>\n  <li> When \\(x\\) is \\(\\frac {- 11}{2}\\), the expression is \\((\\frac {- 11}{2}&minus;3)(2(\\frac {- 11}{2})+11)\\) or \\((\\frac {- 17}{2})(0)\\), which is 0. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>8.4.2: Self Check</h3>\n<em><strong>\n    <p>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</p>\n  </strong></em> <br>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>\n        <p>Solve the equation.</p>\n        <p>\\((x+4)(8x&minus;16)=0\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x=4\\) and \\(x=-4\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incorrect.
