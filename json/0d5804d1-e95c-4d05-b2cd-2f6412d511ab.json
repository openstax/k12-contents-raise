It starts attached to the top of a column, goes up through a loop at a high point, and then back down to the ground.</p>\n<p><img height=\"391\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/653cb5cbeb27d9ebd6051259d7127fa2ad63c627\" width=\"400\"></p>\n<p>The height of the cable in meters is represented by the function \\(h(x) = -4x^2+ 16x + 5\\) where \\(x\\) is the horizontal distance from the column, in meters.</p>\n<p>How far away from the column does the cable attach to the ground?</p>\n<p>The first step in solving would be to set the function equal to 0 and try to factor. Since this equation cannot be factored, we will use graphing technology.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s graph the function using the equation \\(y = -4x^2+ 16x + 5\\).</p>\n<p><img alt=\"GRAPH OF A DOWNWARD PARABOLA WITH A POSITIVE X-INTERCEPT AT 4.291.\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/56a403c649b8b302851a397b794f3d103c41113c\" width=\"400\"></p>\n<p>We can see the function has a zero at \\(x=4.291\\). The \\(x\\)-intercept is \\((4.291, 0)\\).</p>\n<p>This means the cable attaches to the ground 4.291 meters away from the column.</p>\n<p>What else about the steel cable system do we know from this graph?</p>\n<p>We can also tell that the cable attaches to the column 5 meters off the ground at the \\(y\\)-intercept and the loop is approximately 21 meters high at the vertex of the parabola.</p>\n<h4>Try It: Using Technology to Find Rational Factors</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"Reveal1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-content\">\n    <p>The height, in meters, of a model rocket being launched is modeled by the function \\(h(t) = -2t^2 + 14t + 2\\) where \\(t\\) is the number of seconds after launch.</p>\n    <p>How many seconds pass before the rocket reaches the ground?</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-prompt\">\n    <p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-content\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\" data-wait-for-event=\"Reveal1\">\n  <p>Here is how to solve this problem using graphing technology:</p>\n  <p>Since the expression cannot be factored, it should be graphed.</p>\n  <p><img alt=\"GRAPH OF A DOWNWARD PARABOLA WITH A POSITIVE X-INTERCEPT AT 7.14.\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/98fe8e4e5f929935e52a0612e27e3aed2aecf0ac\" width=\"400\"></p>\n  <p>The function has a zero at \\(x=7.14\\).
