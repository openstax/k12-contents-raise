Stadium recliner seats cost $18 each, and regular seats cost $15 each. The theater has a total of 40 seats. When every seat is sold, the theater earns $648 in ticket sales. How many stadium recliner seats, \\(x\\), and how many regular seats, \\(y\\), are there?</p>\n<p>To solve this problem, we first need to recognize that there are two constraints in this situation. The constraints are the total number of seats in the theater and the total money earned from sales. Let&rsquo;s write an equation to represent each constraint.</p>\n<p><strong>Constraint #1: </strong>the total number of seats</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are \\(x\\) stadium recliner seats and \\(y\\) regular seats representing a total of 40 seats.</p>\n<p>This is represented by the equation \\( x + y = 40 \\).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> <strong>Constraint #2:</strong> the total sales from the seats</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stadium recliner seats cost $18 and regular seats cost $15, for a total of $648.</p>\n<p>This is represented by the equation \\(18x + 15y = 648\\).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are many ways to solve these equations: graphing and algebraic solving, guessing and checking, or using tables.</p>\n<h4>Try It: Meeting Constraints in a Real-World Situation</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"Reveal1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-content\">\n<p>Let&rsquo;s try creating a table.
