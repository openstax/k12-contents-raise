In recent lessons, you learned that the method you use to write the equation of a line is determined by the information given. You will continue to use those methods along with the relationship between slopes of lines.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Write an equation of a line parallel to a given line.</li>\n  <li>Write an equation of a line perpendicular to a given line.</li>\n  <li>Write an equation of a line parallel or perpendicular to an axis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><span>1.13.1: Using Point-Slope Form to Write the Equation of a Line</span><br></li>\n  <li><span>1.13.2: Writing an Equation of a Line Parallel to a Given Line</span><br>\n    <ul>\n      <li><span>1.13.2: Self Check&nbsp;</span></li>\n      <li><span>1.13.2: Additional Resources<br></span></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><span>1.13.3: Writing an Equation of a Line Perpendicular to a Given Line</span><br>\n    <ul>\n      <li><span>1.13.3: Self Check&nbsp;</span></li>\n      <li><span>1.13.3: Additional Resources<br></span></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><span>1.13.4: Writing an Equation of a Line Parallel or Perpendicular to an Axis</span><br>\n    <ul>\n      <li><span>1.13.4: Self Check&nbsp;</span></li>\n      <li><span>1.13.4: Additional Resources<br></span></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><span>1.13.5: Drawing Parallel and Perpendicular Lines</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>1.13.6: Practice</li>\n  <li>1.13.7: Lesson Summary</li>\n</ul>"
