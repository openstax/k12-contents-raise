While exploring the new topic, students will review finding slope and writing lines in point-slope and slope-intercept form. They also use their understanding of the \\(y\\)-intercept form of the equation of a line. In recent lessons, students learned that the method they use to write the equation of a line is determined by the information given. They will continue to use those methods along with the relationship between slopes of lines to identify and write equations of parallel and perpendicular lines. Students must understand the concept of reciprocals and opposite reciprocals to understand perpendicular lines. Having students compare graphs can help them visualize the concepts.</p>\n<p>Students will find the equations of lines parallel and perpendicular to horizontal and vertical lines. They will use the understanding that the slope of a horizontal line is zero and the slope of a vertical line is undefined.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h3>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"main\">\n<div class=\"preparation\"><span>Students will be able to:</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"main\">\n<div class=\"preparation\">\n<ul>\n<li>Use the relationship between slopes of lines to write equations of lines that are parallel or perpendicular.</li>\n<li>Use the point-slope form to write linear equations of parallel and perpendicular lines.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Write an equation of a line parallel to a given line.</span></li>\n<li><span>Write an equation of a line perpendicular to a given line.</span></li>\n<li><span>Write an equation of a line parallel or perpendicular to an axis.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h3>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>TEKS</td>\n<td>Explanation of Coverage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A2(B) <u>write linear equations in two variables in various forms, including \\( y = mx + b \\)</u>, \\( Ax + By = C \\), and <u>\\( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\), given one point and the slope</u> and given two points;</td>\n<td>Partial coverage: Lesson provides content that covers part of this TEKS.
