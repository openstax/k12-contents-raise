They consider not only whether the inequalities appropriately model the situations, but also whether there are assumptions that need to be stated and whether the solution sets make sense in context.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second goal is to practice finding the solution set to an inequality by reasoning about its composition and parts. Consider the example \\( 0.5x &gt; 10x \\). We can reason that for 0.5 times a number to be greater than 10 times the same number, the number must be negative, so the solution is \\( x &lt; 0 \\). Likewise, we can see that all values of \\( x \\) are solutions to \\( x &lt; x + 5 \\) because 5 more than a number will always be greater than that number.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The lesson includes an optional activity for practice solving inequalities without any context.</p>\n<h3>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h3>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Analyze inequalities to determine whether the solution is greater or less than the solution to a related equation.</li>\n  <li>Write and solve inequalities in one variable to represent the constraints in situations and to solve problems.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Analyze the structure of an inequality in one variable to help determine if the solution is greater or less than the solution to the related equation.</li>\n  <li>Write and solve inequalities to answer questions about a situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h3>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<div align=\"left\" dir=\"ltr\">\n  <table>\n    <colgroup>\n      <col>\n      <col>\n    </colgroup>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\">A5(B) solve linear inequalities in one variable, including those for which the application of the distributive property is necessary and for which variables are included on both sides.</p><br>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\">Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</div><strong></strong><br>\n<h3>Lesson Activities&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>2.9.1: Writing an Inequality to Represent a Constraint</li>\n  <li>2.9.2: Using Inequalities to Solve a Problem<ul>\n      <li>2.9.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>2.9.2: Additional Resources</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>2.9.3: Different Ways of Solving an Inequality<ul>\n      <li>2.9.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>2.9.3: Additional Resources</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>2.9.4: Matching Inequalities and Solutions (Optional)</li>\n  <li>2.9.5: Solving Inequalities<ul>\n      <li>2.9.5: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>2.9.5: Additional Resources</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>2.9.6: Writing Inequalities to Represent a Situation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 2.9.7: Practice.</p>\n<h3>Required Materials</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>N/A</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Required Preparation&nbsp;</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>N/A</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Lesson Vocabulary</h3>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson.
