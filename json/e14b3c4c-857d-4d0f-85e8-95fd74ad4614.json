As students trade roles explaining their thinking and listening, they have opportunities to explain their reasoning and critique the reasoning of others.</p>\n<p>One sequence and one definition do not have matches. Students are tasked with writing the corresponding match.</p>\n<p>Monitor for students using clear reasoning as they create a recursive definition for the sequence 18, 20, 22, 24 to share during the discussion.</p>\n<p>Making a spreadsheet available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Tell students that for each sequence, one partner finds its matching recursive definition and explains why they think it matches. The partner&rsquo;s job is to listen and make sure they agree. If they don&rsquo;t agree, the partners discuss until they come to an agreement. For the next sequence, the students swap roles. If necessary, demonstrate this protocol before students start working.</p>\n<p>Ensure that students notice that one sequence and one definition do not have matches, and they are tasked with writing the corresponding match for each.</p>\n<h5> Support for English Language Learners</h5>\n<div>\n  <p>Use this routine to support small-group discussion as students should take turns finding a match. Display the following sentence frames for all to see: &ldquo;Sequence _____ and definition _____ match because . . .&rdquo; and &ldquo;I noticed _____, so I matched . . .&rdquo; Encourage students to challenge each other when they disagree, and to press for precise mathematical language. This will help students clarify their reasoning about each match.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n<div>\n  <p> Leverage choice around perceived challenge. Invite groups of students to find matches for at least 4 of the sequences. Chunking this task into more manageable parts may also support students who benefit from additional processing time.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>\n<p>Start with the recursive definition: \\(R(n)=3R(n-1) + 1\\), \\(n\\geq2\\) and given \\(R(1)=-1\\). See the table below for how to substitute to find more terms in the sequence using the recursive definition. Substitute the term number, \\(n\\), in for \\(n\\) in the recursive definition.

After work time, select students to share their sketches, displaying them for all to see and compare.</p>\n<h3>4.16.2: Self Check</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Following the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>\n        <p>Which of the following sequences matches the recursive definition for \\(G(n)\\) where \\(G(n)=G(n-1)+4\\) for \\(n\\geq2\\) when \\(G(1)=3\\)?</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p> 4, 8, 12, 16, 20</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incorrect.

Students will not automatically have access to this content, so you may wish to share it with those who could benefit from it.</em></strong></p>\n<h4>Writing Recursive Definitions</h4>\n<p>Sometimes we can define a sequence recursively. That is, we can describe how to calculate the next term in a sequence if we know the previous term.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a sequence: 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, . . . This is an arithmetic sequence, where each term is 4 more than the previous term. Since sequences are functions, let&rsquo;s call this sequence \\(f\\). Then we can use function notation to write \\(f(n)=f(n-1)+4\\). Here, \\(f(n)\\) is the term, \\(f(n-1)\\) is the previous term, and + 4 represents the common difference since f is an arithmetic sequence.</p>\n<p>When we define a function recursively, we must also say what the first term is. Without that, there would be no way of knowing if the sequence defined by \\(f(n)=f(n-1)+4\\) started with 6 or 81 or any other number. Here, one possible initial condition is \\(f(1)=6\\). It could also make sense to number the terms starting with 0, using \\(f(0)=6\\).</p>\n<p>Combining this information gives the recursive definition: \\(f(1)=6\\) and \\(f(n)=f(n-1)+4\\) for \\(n\\geq2\\), where \\(n\\) is an integer. We include the \\(n\\geq2\\) at the end since the value of \\(f\\) at 1 is already given, and the other terms in the sequence are generated by inputting integers larger than 1 into the definition.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some examples from the first activity and write the recursive definition for each type of sequence:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    A: 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, . . .\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Arithmetic<br>\n    <br>\n    \\(A(1)=30, A(n)=A(n-1)+10, n\\geq2\\)\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n  <li>\n    B: 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 2.5, . . .\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Geometric<br>\n    <br>\n    \\(B(1)=80, B(n)=B(n-1) \\frac12, n\\geq2\\)\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n  <li>\n    F: 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, . . .\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Neither<br>\n    <br>\n    \\(F(1)=1, F(n)=F(n-1)2 + 1, n\\geq2\\)\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Try It: Writing Recursive Definitions</h4>\n<p>Write \\(E(1)\\) and a recursive definition for \\(E(n)\\):</p>\n<p>E: 20, 13, 6, &ndash;1, &ndash;8, . . .</p>\n<p>In your notebook, write down your answer. Then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to check your work.</p>\n<h5> Solution</h5>\n<p>Here is how to write the recursive definition for this sequence:</p>\n<p>\\(E(1)=20\\), then each term after is formed by subtracting 7, so \\(E(n)=E(n-1)-7\\), \\(n\\geq2\\)</p>\n<p>How did you do? Know that you learn more from wrong answers than from right answers! Wrong answers help us find flaws in our thinking. Take a minute to think about <em>why</em> you got the question wrong. Then you won&rsquo;t get this type of question wrong again!</p>"
