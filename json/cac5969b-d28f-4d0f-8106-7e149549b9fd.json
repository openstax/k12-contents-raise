Check if the equation of either line in the system represents a vertical line. If there is a vertical line, determine on which side of the \\(y\\)-axis the line would be. Finally, check if the slope of the non-vertical line is negative.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p>Correct answers are:</p>\n    <p>a. No. The graph for \\(x = -5\\) would be on the left side of the vertical axis, which is not what&rsquo;s shown.</p>\n    <p>b. No. The graph for \\(y = -1\\) would be a horizontal line, but no horizontal line is shown.</p>\n    <p>c. Yes. \\(3x = 8\\) can be rearranged into \\(x=\\frac83\\). The graph for \\(x=\\frac83\\) is a vertical line to the right of the vertical axis. \\(3x + y = 15\\) can be rewritten as \\(y = -3x + 15\\). Its graph has a negative slope and a positive \\(y\\)-value for the vertical intercept.</p>\n    <p>d. No. The graph for \\(y = 2x - 7\\) would have a positive slope and a negative \\(y\\)-value for the vertical intercept, neither of which matches the given graphs.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<!--Interaction End -->"
