Here, they investigate those connections closely. Just as they have done with expressions in standard and factored forms, students use technology to experiment with each parameter of expressions in vertex form and study the effects on the graph. In this process, they practice looking for regularity in repeated reasoning. If working with a partner, students will take turns using the graphing technology and recording observations. As students trade roles explaining their thinking and listening, they have opportunities to explain their reasoning and critique the reasoning of others.</p>\n<p>The work also encourages students to begin looking at the structure of the form&mdash;\\(a\\) squared expression with a coefficient \\(a\\) and a constant term. In an upcoming lesson, they will further make sense of how this structure relates to the graph.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Provide access to graphing technology. Consider arranging students in groups of two. For the first two questions involving graphing, ask one partner to operate the graphing technology and the other to record the group's observations, and then to switch roles halfway.</p>\n<p>Consider pausing for a class discussion after the second question so students can share their observations. When discussing the effects of adding a constant term to \\((x&minus;h)^2\\), ask students how the vertical movement of the vertex affects the \\(x\\)-intercepts of the graph. If not mentioned by students, point out that in some cases it produces graphs that are away from the \\(x\\)-axis and thus have no \\(x\\)-intercepts.</p>\n<p>Encourage students to put their graphing technology out of reach while they work on the third question.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>Use the graphing tool or technology outside the course. Graph \\(y=x^2\\). Then, add different numbers to \\(x\\) before it is squared (for example, \\(y=(x+4)^2\\), \\(y=(x&minus;3)^2\\)) and observe how the graph changes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select th<strong>e solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Adding a number to \\(x\\) moves the graph to the left. Subtracting a number (or adding a negative number) moves the graph to the right. The vertex stays on the \\(x\\)-axis.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n  <li>Use the graphing tool or technology outside the course. Graph \\(y=(x&minus;1)^2\\). Then, experiment with each of the following changes to the function and see how they affect the graph and the vertex.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n  <li> Add different constant terms to \\((x&minus;1)^2\\) (for example: \\(y=(x&minus;1)^2+5\\), \\(y=(x&minus;1)^2&minus;9)\\). </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the<strong> solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Adding a constant term moves it up and subtracting moves it down. The \\(x\\)-coordinate of the vertex doesn't change.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\" type=\"a\">\n  <li> Multiplying \\((x&minus;1)^2\\) by different coefficients (for example: \\(y=3(x&minus;1)^2\\), \\(y=-2(x&minus;1)^2\\), \\(y=0.5(x&minus;1)^2\\). </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Multiplying the squared term by a number doesn't change the vertex, but it changes the opening of the graph to \"wider\" or \"narrower,\" or changes the direction of the graph to open upward or downward.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\">\n  <li>Without graphing, find the coordinates of the vertex of \\(y=(x+10)^2\\) and determine if it opens up or down.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n  <li> What is the \\(x\\)-coordinate of the vertex? <br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>Answer: </strong>-10\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\" type=\"a\">\n  <li> What is the \\(y\\)-coordinate of the vertex? <br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> 0\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\" type=\"a\">\n  <li> Does the graph open up or down? <br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>Answer: </strong>The graph opens upward.

This seems odd: when we add \\(k\\), the vertex of the parabola moves up \\(k\\) units. But when we subtract \\(h\\) within the squared term, the vertex of the parabola moves right \\(h\\) units, not left.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s explore why. We know the \\(y\\)-coordinate of the vertex is \\(y = k\\). To find that using this equation, we need to know where \\(a(x-h)^2\\) is zero, because that will make \\(y=k\\). Set \\(a(x-h)^2=0\\) . This happens when \\(x-h=0\\), which is when \\(x=h\\). That means \\(h\\) is the \\(x\\)-coordinate of the vertex.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n<p>Find the vertex of \\(y=3(x-4)^2-2\\).</p>\n<p>The parabola of the quadratic will shift right 4 (remember this horizontal shift is counterintuitive and translates in the opposite direction of what the expression &ldquo;looks like&rdquo;) and down 2.</p>\n<p>So, the vertex is at \\((4, -2)\\).</p>\n<h4>Try It: Using Vertex Form</h4>\n<p>Find the vertex of \\(y= (x-2)^2+5\\).</p>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the solution button to compare your work.</p>\n<h5>Solution</h5>\n<p>Here is how to find the vertex:</p>\n<p>The quadratic shifts to the right 2 and up 5.
