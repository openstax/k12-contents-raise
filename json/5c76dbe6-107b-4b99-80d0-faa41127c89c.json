No tables of values are given here, so students will need to estimate the coordinates on the graph to compute the average rates of change.</p>\n<p>Students reason quantitatively and abstractly as they extract contextual information from a graph, manipulate it symbolically, and then interpret the numerical results in context. To interpret the average rates of change, students need to pay attention to the units used to measure the input (years) and output (people in millions). This is a chance to practice attending to precision.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<br>\n<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>\n<div>\n  <p>Create a display of important terms and vocabulary. During the launch, take time to review terms that students will need to access this activity. Invite students to suggest language or diagrams to include that will support their understanding of rate of change, slope, and average rate of change.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement </h4>\n<p>The graphs show the populations of California and Texas over time.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Graph of the populations of two states over time on a coordinate plane.&nbsp;\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/127fe8074872a6c9489127ecd8679d6c4f86ec31\"></p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>Estimate the average rate of change in the population in each state between 1970 and 2010. Explain your reasoning. <br>\n    <br>\n  </li>\n  <li>In this situation, what does each rate of change mean? <br>\n    <br>\n  </li>\n  <li>Which state&rsquo;s population grew more quickly between 1900 and 2000? Explain your reasoning.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>The population of California was about 20 million in 1970 and 37 million in 2010. The average rate of change is: \\(\\frac{37-20}{2010-1970}=\\frac{17}{40}=0.425\\) million per year. The population of Texas was about 11 million in 1970 and 25 million in 2010. The average rate of change is \\(\\frac{25-11}{2010-1970}=\\frac{14}{40}=0.35\\) million per year.\n    &nbsp;<br>\n    <br>\n  </li>\n  <li>On average, the population of California was growing by 425,000 people per year, and the population of Texas was growing by 350,000 people per year.<br>\n    <br>\n  </li>\n  <li>California is growing more quickly. For example: If we connect each pair of points representing the population of each state in 1900 and 2000, the segment for California has a greater slope, so it has a greater average rate of change.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Video: Interpreting Average Rate of Change</h4>\n<p>Watch the following video to learn more about interpreting the average rate of change.</p>\n<video controls=\"true\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" width=\"550\">\n  <source src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b229f583de20650b5a4f2b338b6650c68e5400a6\">\n  <track default=\"true\" kind=\"captions\" label=\"On\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/ffe8fb6047a04094415c3cb93e1637e4830369a8\" srclang=\"en_us\">https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b229f583de20650b5a4f2b338b6650c68e5400a6\n</video>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>\n<p>The interpretation of the slope is the most difficult part of this section. It&rsquo;s often hard for students to think about the points on the graph as meaningful pieces of data. Try to talk about each coordinate as the data value it represents. Again remind students that the \\(y\\)-values are on top if the average rate of change formula, so the meaning of the slope is always \\(y\\) units per&nbsp;\\(x\\) unit. Sometimes it helps to point out slope as a unit rate, or the rate of change over 1 \\(x\\)-axis unit.</p>\n<h4> Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>When calculating average rates of change for the populations of California and Texas between 1970 and 2010, students are likely to get slightly different results from one another. Discuss why this might be. If not mentioned by students, point out that it is most likely due to differences in how they estimated the populations from the graphs.</p>\n<p>Invite students to share their response to the last question. Make sure students recognize that it is not always necessary to compute average rates of change or slopes of lines to compare the trends of two functions. We can visually compare the steepness of the lines connecting the endpoints of each graph.</p>\n<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>\n<div>\n  <p>Use this routine to help students improve their verbal and written responses to the question, &ldquo;Which state&rsquo;s population grew more quickly between 1900 and 2000?&rdquo; Give students time to meet with 2&ndash;3 partners to share and get feedback on their responses. The listener should press for detail and precision in language by asking: &ldquo;Can you say that a different way?&rdquo;; &ldquo;Does your method work using a different time interval?&rdquo;; or &ldquo;Besides computing the average rate of change, can you think of another way to determine this?&rdquo; Invite students to go back and revise or refine their written explanation based on the feedback from peers. This will help students find and interpret average rates of change in context.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h4> 4.7.3: Self Check</h4>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION: </strong></p>\n        <p>Brooke was racing bikes with a friend on the way to the park.
