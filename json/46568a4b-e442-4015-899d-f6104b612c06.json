If I cut the framing material into 9 pieces, each one being 2.5 inches by \\(\\frac {4}{9}\\) inch, I&rsquo;ll have more than enough material to surround the picture because those pieces would yield \\(9 \\cdot 2.5\\), or 22.5 inches for the frame.&rdquo;</p>\n    <p>Do you agree with Juan? Be prepared to show your reasoning.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-prompt\">\n    <p>Enter your answer here:</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-ack\">\n    <p>Compare your answer:</p>\n    <p>No, Juan is not correct because 9 pieces would not be enough to go around the frame. While the total length of those pieces is enough to surround the picture, he will need at least two pieces for each short side to cover 4 inches and at least 3 pieces for each long side to cover 7 inches. This adds up to 10 pieces, as shown below.</p>\n    <p><img height=\"416\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/5fae4a0aa1dabe1a82fbdbd38464f6c6a71d60b5\" width=\"412\"></p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<!--End interaction-->"
