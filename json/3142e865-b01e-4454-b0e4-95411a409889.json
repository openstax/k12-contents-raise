The linear model is given by the equation \\(y = 1.5x + 22.7\\), where \\(y\\) represents maximum noise level and \\(x\\) represents the number of people, in thousands, in the stadium.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\\(y = 1.5x + 22.7\\)</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Scatter plot.\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/bf2fe432333358279dea1ef61899da13956c741b\"><br></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>The slope of the linear model is 1.5. What does this mean in terms of the maximum noise level and the number of people?</li>\n  <li>A sports announcer states that there are 65,000 fans in the stadium. Estimate the maximum noise level. Is this estimate reasonable? Explain your reasoning.</li>\n  <li>What is the \\(y\\)-intercept of the linear model given? What does it mean in the context of the problem? Is this reasonable? Explain your reasoning.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<ol>\n  <li><span>For example: For every additional thousand people in the stadium, the noise level increases by about 1.5 decibels.</span></li>\n  <li>120.2 decibels. For example: It is a reasonable value since the data seem to fit a linear model well, so it is probably near this value.</li>\n  <li>The \\(y\\)-intercept is (0,22.7), which means a stadium with no people in it will have a maximum noise level of 22.7 decibels. Sample reasonings:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n  <ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>This is actually reasonable since a whisper is about 20 decibels.</li>\n      <li>This is not reasonable since it should be silent with no people in the stadium.</li>\n      <li>This is not reasonable because the point is so far from the data that it is unlikely that the linear model will be accurate.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>\n<h5>Points to emphasize</h5>\n<p>This is a great opportunity to highlight that we have to look at axes and demonstrate the usefulness of using an equation for a fit line, rather than sketching on a graph. This will be revisited on the Lesson 3.2 cool down.</p>\n<p><br></p>"
