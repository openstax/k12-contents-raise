From the factored form, we can tell that the graph intersects the horizontal axis at \\((1-t)\\). The zero of the function is the same value.</p>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\" type=\"a\">\n    <li> What do the zeros tell us in this situation?\n      <ul>\n        <li> The positive zero means the time, in seconds, when the basketball is on the ground or hits the ground. </li>\n        <li> The negative zero represents the height, in feet, when the time is zero. </li>\n        <li> The positive zero represents the time, in seconds, when the basketball reaches the maximum height. </li>\n        <li> The negative zero represents the time, in seconds, when the basketball is on the ground or hits the ground. </li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n  </ol><br>\n  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> The positive zero means the time, in seconds, when the basketball is on the ground or hits the ground.</p>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"4\" type=\"a\">\n    <li> Are both zeros meaningful?\n      <ul>\n        <li> Yes </li>\n        <li> No </li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n  </ol><br>\n  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> No. Only the positive zero is meaningful.

When \\((1&minus;t)(8+16t)\\)is rewritten in standard form it is \\(8+8t&minus;16t^2\\). The constant term (which corresponds to the \\(y\\)-intercept) tells us the height of the basketball when \\(t=0\\) or when it is launched.</p>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"6\" type=\"a\">\n    <li> When, in seconds, does the ball reach its highest point? </li>\n  </ol><br>\n  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> 0.25 seconds. Graphing \\(h\\) shows the maximum point at \\((0.25,9)\\). Or, you could recognize that 0.25 is the \\(x\\)-coordinate of the vertex because it is halfway between the two zeros, -0.5 and 1.</p>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"7\" type=\"a\">\n    <li> How high, in feet, does the ball go? </li>\n  </ol><br>\n  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> 9 feet. Graphing \\(h\\) shows the maximum point at \\((0.25,9)\\). Or, you could recognize that 0.25 is the \\(x\\)-coordinate of the vertex because it is halfway between the two zeros, -0.5 and 1. Then evaluate the function at 0.25 to get a height of 9.</p>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\">\n  <li>The height in feet of a thrown football is modeled by the equation \\(f(t)=6+30t&minus;16t^2\\), where time \\(t\\) is measured in seconds.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" type=\"a\">\n    <li> Which term in the equation describes how many feet above the ground the football was thrown?\n      <ul>\n        <li> The constant term 6 </li>\n        <li> The linear term \\(30t\\) </li>\n        <li> The squared term \\(-16t^2\\) </li>\n        <li> The squared term \\(16t^2\\) </li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n  </ol><br>\n  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> The constant term 6</p>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\" type=\"a\">\n    <li> Which term in the equation describes the initial upward velocity of the football in feet per second?\n      <ul>\n        <li> The constant term 6 </li>\n        <li> The linear term \\(30t\\) </li>\n        <li> The squared term \\(-16t^2\\) </li>\n        <li> The squared term \\(16t^2\\) </li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n  </ol><br>\n  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> The linear term \\(30t\\).</p>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\" type=\"a\">\n    <li> How does the squared term \\(-16t^2\\) affect the value of the function \\(f\\)? </li>\n  </ol><br>\n  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> The squared term decreases the value of the function because the values of \\(16t^2\\) are being subtracted from \\(6+30t\\)</p>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"4\" type=\"a\">\n    <li> What does this term \\(&minus;16t^2\\) reveal about the situation?\n      <ul>\n        <li> The influence of gravity pulling the ball down to the ground. </li>\n        <li> The initial upward velocity of the football. </li>\n        <li> How far the football was thrown above the ground. </li>\n        <li> How long the ball is in the air before it hits the ground. </li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n  </ol><br>\n  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> The influence of gravity pulling the ball down to the ground.</p>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"4\">\n  <li>The height in feet of an arrow is modeled by the equation \\(h(t)=(1+2t)(18&minus;8t)\\), where \\(t\\) is seconds after the arrow is shot.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" type=\"a\">\n    <li> At what time, in seconds, does the arrow hit the ground? </li>\n  </ol><br>\n  <p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>2.25. The positive zero is 2.25 because \\((18&minus;8t)\\) is equal to zero when \\(t=2.25\\). The zeros mean the times, in seconds, when the arrow is on the ground. Only the positive zero makes sense. The negative zero would represent a time before the arrow was launched.</p>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\" type=\"a\">\n    <li> At what height, in feet, is the arrow shot? </li>\n  </ol><br>\n  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> 18 feet. When the arrow is shot, \\(t\\) is 0 and \\(h(0)=(1+2&sdot;0)(18&minus;8&sdot;0)=(1)(18)=18\\).</p>\n</ol>\n<p>5.

The objects are launched when \\(t=0\\). \\(f(0)=4+32&sdot;0&minus;16(0)2=4\\) and \\(g(0)=2.5+40&sdot;0&minus;16(0)2=2.5\\).</p>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\" type=\"a\">\n    <li> Which object was launched with a greater upward velocity?\n      <ul>\n        <li> Object A </li>\n        <li> Object B </li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n  </ol><br>\n  <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Object B.
