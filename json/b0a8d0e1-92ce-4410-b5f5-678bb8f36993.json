The point&nbsp;\\( (0,0) \\), which is on the line, is also not a solution. I concluded that the points on and above the line are not solutions, and the region below the line represents the solutions.<br></span><br></div>\n<div>\n<h3>Response to Student Thinking</h3>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h4>More Chances</h4>Activities 2.11.2 and 2.11.3 both provide additional opportunities to consider how to make decisions about which side of the boundary line to shade.\n</div>"
