Students start by identifying a function represented by a given graph and using the graph to make sense of a situation. They also examine two abstract graphs, with unlabeled axes, and decide which one represents a given situation. This level of abstraction is appropriate at this stage. It gives students an opportunity to apply what they have learned about the relationship between an exponential context and its graph and to use graphs to better interpret the contexts. In both cases, they rely on their understanding of the connections between the parameters in an exponential expression and the features of an exponential graph to answer questions. Connecting exponential functions to real-world situations helps students understand why it is important to learn about this type of function.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Identify the initial value and growth factor of an exponential function given a graph showing two points with non-consecutive input values. </li>\n  <li> Interpret the intersection of the graphs of two functions that represent a situation. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing) &nbsp;</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li> Explain the meaning of the intersection of the graphs of two functions in terms of the situations they represent. </li>\n  <li> Write an equation for the function given two points on a graph of an exponential function. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)&nbsp;</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>A9(D) <u>graph exponential functions that model growth and decay and identify key features, including \\(y\\)-intercept and asymptote, in mathematical and real-world problems.</u></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Partial coverage: Lesson provides content that covers part of this TEKS.
