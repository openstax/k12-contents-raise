You will write inequalities in two variables to represent constraints, and interpret the points on a boundary line and on either side of it in terms of the situation.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interpret points in the coordinate plane and decide if they are solutions to the inequality, given a two-variable inequality that represents a situation.</li>\n<li>Find the solutions to a two-variable inequality by using the graph of a related two-variable equation.</li>\n<li>Write inequalities to describe the constraints in a situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2.11.1: Sketching a Graph to Represent an Equation</li>\n<li>2.11.2: Writing an Inequality to Represent a Constraint</li>\n<li>2.11.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li>2.11.3: Graphing Solutions and Interpreting Points</li>\n<li>2.11.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li>2.11.4: Reasoning Points Along Boundary Line (Optional)</li>\n<li>2.11.5: Recognizing Points for an Inequality</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>2.11.6: Practice</li>\n<li>2.11.7: Summary</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>"
