Once we see how an equation in slope&ndash;intercept form and its graph are related, we&rsquo;ll have one more method we can use to graph lines.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Let&rsquo;s look at the graph of the equation \\(y=\\frac12x+3\\) and find its slope and y-intercept.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"The figure shows the graph of a straight line on the x y-coordinate plane. The x-axis runs from negative 10 to 10. The y-axis runs from negative 10 to 10. The line goes through the points (0, 3), (2, 4), and (4, 5). A right triangle is drawn by connecting the three points (2, 4), (2, 5), and (4, 5). The vertical side of the triangle is labeled &ldquo;Rise equals 1&rdquo;. The horizontal side of the triangle is labeled &ldquo;Run equals 2&rdquo;. The line is labeled y equals 1 divided by 2 x plus 3.\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/f937e5f1161104d9a837fb53f6309b01a60c9ddb\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The red lines in the graph show us the rise is 1 and the run is 2. Substituting into the slope formula:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>\\(m\\;=\\;\\frac{rise}{run}\\)</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>\\(m\\;=\\;\\frac12\\)</span><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The y-intercept is 3.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Look at the equation of this line.</span><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"The figure shows the equation y equals 1 divided by 2 x plus 3.

The 1 divided by 2 is emphasized in red. The 3 is emphasized in blue.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When a linear equation is solved for y, the coefficient of the x term is the slope and the constant term is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept. We say that the equation \\(y=\\frac12x+3\\) is in slope&ndash;intercept form. Sometimes the slope&ndash;intercept form is called the &ldquo;y-form.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"m equals 1 divided by 2; y-intercept is (0, 3). y equals 1 divided by 2 x plus 3. y equals m x plus b. The m and 1 divided by 2 are emphasized in red.
