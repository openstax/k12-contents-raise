As before, they are prompted to reason repeatedly about the value of one quantity given the other and to generalize the process by writing an expression. They then connect the work here to the idea of writing an equation and isolating a variable of interest.</p>\n        <p>As students work, monitor for the different ways students reason about the unknown number of minutes in the second question (for Tank A) and the last question (for Tank B). Some students may find the missing value by reasoning about the quantities informally. Others may write an equation and reason about the equation or solve the equation for a variable.</p>\n        <p>For example, to find the number of minutes that have passed when Tank B has 18 liters left, students may:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Reason that the tank has lost 62 liters because <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 80-62=18 \\)</span> or <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 80-18=62 \\)</span>. If each minute it loses 2.5 liters, then it would take <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( \\frac{62}{2.5} \\)</span> or 24.8 minutes for it to lose 62 liters.</li>\n          <li>Write <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 80 - 2.5t = 18 \\)</span> and think: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for a number that, when multiplied by 2.5 and subtracted from 80, gives 18,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for a number that, when multiplied by 2.5, is equal to <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 80-18 \\)</span>.&rdquo;</li>\n          <li>\n            <p>Write <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 80 - 2.5t = 75 \\)</span> and solve for <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( t \\)</span> this way:</p>\n            <div class=\"imgrid\">\n              <div class=\"g--row g--row-1\">\n                <div class=\"g--col-1 g--column g--content g--half g--row-1\">\n                  <p><span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( \\begin {align} 80-2.5t &amp;=18\\\\ -2.5t &amp;= 18 - 80\\\\t &amp;= \\frac{18-80}{-2.5} \\\\t &amp;= \\frac{-62}{-2.5} \\\\ t&amp;=\\frac{62}{2.5}\\\\ t&amp;=24.8 \\end{align} \\)</span></p>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"g--col-2 g--column g--content g--half g--row-1\">\n                  <p>Or this way:</p>\n                  <p><span class=\"math\">\\( \\begin {align} 80-2.5t &amp;=18\\\\80-18-2.5t &amp;= 0\\\\80-18 &amp;= 2.5t \\\\\\frac{80-18}{2.5}&amp;= t \\\\ \\frac{62}{2.5} &amp;=t\\\\24.8 &amp;=t \\end{align} \\)</span></p>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Regardless of the approach students take, the important idea to spotlight (for Tank B) is that finding the time at which the water in the tank reaches a certain volume can be done by subtracting that volume (<span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( v \\)</span>) from the original volume (80 liters) and then dividing it by 2.5. That process can be summarized by the expression: <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( \\dfrac{80-v}{2.5} \\)</span>.</p>\n        <p>If we start out with the equation <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 80-2.5t = v \\)</span> and perform allowable moves to isolate <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( t \\)</span>, we will end up with <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( t=\\dfrac{80-v}{2.5} \\)</span>.</p>\n      </div>\n      <h3>Launch</h3>\n      <div class=\"body\">\n        <p>Keep students in groups of 2 and provide continued access to calculators. </p>\n        <p>If time is limited, consider asking one half of the class to answer the first two questions about Tank A and the other half to answer the last two questions about Tank B.</p>\n        <h4>Support for Students with Disabilities</h4>\n        <div>\n          <em>Engagement: Provide Access by Recruiting Interest. </em>Leverage choice around perceived challenge.
