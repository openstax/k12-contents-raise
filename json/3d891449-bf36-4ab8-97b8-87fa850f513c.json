One motivation for rearranging the equation is to find an expression that, when entered into a calculator or computer, can be used to quickly find the value of one quantity given the value of the other.</p>\n<p>As they use spreadsheet technology to create mathematical models, test them, and solve problems, students engage in aspects of mathematical modeling (MP4).</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 3&ndash;4 and provide access to devices with spreadsheet or graphing technology.</p>\n<p>Give students a few minutes of quiet time to think about the first question and then time to discuss their responses with their group. Ask students to pause for a class discussion, and ensure everyone is using a correct equation before proceeding.</p>\n<p>Once students have responses for the second question, invite them to share how they found the number of cars that can be shipped if the cargo already has some number of trucks. Next, ask for the expressions they wrote to find the number of cars that can fit if there are <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( t \\)</span> trucks. Record the expressions for all to see.</p>\n<p>Tell students that we can test the expressions by using a calculator or computer. Consider demonstrating how to use technology to calculate the number of cars given the number of trucks. You may need to prepare alternate instructions if using different technology in the classroom.</p>\n<p>Tell students that their job in the last question is to find the number of trucks when the number of cars is known. Encourage them to test their equations using available technology.</p>\n<h4>Support for Students with Disabilities</h4>\n<div class=\"c-annotation c-annotation--swd\">\n<em>Representation: Access for Perception. </em>Provide students with a physical copy of written directions for using the spreadsheet or graphing technology available and read them aloud.
