Some equations can be easily solved by reasoning. Others would require solving by graphing because students have not yet learned the strategies to solve algebraically. Students who use graphing technology only when needed practice choosing tools strategically.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Give students continued access to technology.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p> Solve each equation. Be prepared to explain or show your reasoning.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>\\(x^2=121\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(x=11\\) and \\(x=-11\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n  <li>\\(x^2&minus;31=5\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(x=6\\) and \\(x=-6\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\">\n  <li>\\((x&minus;4)(x&minus;4)=0\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong><span>\\(x=4\\)</span></p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"4\">\n  <li>\\((x+3)(x&minus;1)=5\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(x=-4\\) and \\(x=2\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"5\">\n  <li>\\((x+1)^2=-4\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> No solution</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"6\">\n  <li>\\((x&minus;4)(x&minus;1)=990\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(x=34\\) and \\(x=-29\\)</p>\n<h4>Video: Choosing an Effective Strategy to Solve Quadratic Equations</h4>\n<p>Watch the following video to learn more about choosing an effective strategy to solve quadratic equations.</p>\n<video controls=\"true\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" width=\"550\">\n  <source src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/84d199f48e88269b0d50c3dc76afa178bc452da3\">\n  <track default=\"true\" kind=\"captions\" label=\"On\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/9c2b14c2f3273e712be01bf622cc740041c5e475\" srclang=\"en_us\">\n  https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/84d199f48e88269b0d50c3dc76afa178bc452da3\n</video>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Select students to share their solutions and strategies. If not mentioned by students' explanations, highlight that:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> The first three equations, as well as the equation \\((x+1)2=-4\\), can be solved by reasoning, and graphing is not necessary. </li>\n  <li> The last three equations can be solved by graphing. There are two ways to do so, as shown in a previous activity. </li>\n  <ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n    <li> One way is to graph each side of the equation separately: \\(y\\) = <em>expression</em> on one side and \\(y\\) = <em>number</em> on the other side. </li>\n    <li> Another way is to rearrange the equation such that it is in the form of <em>expression</em> \\(= 0\\), graph \\(y\\) = <em>expression</em>, and then find the \\(x\\)-intercepts. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> The equation \\((x+1)^2=-4\\) states that some number squared is &ndash;4. Because no number can be squared to get a negative number, we can reason that there are no solutions. If this equation is solved by graphing \\(y=(x+1)^2+4\\), the graph would show no \\(x\\)-intercepts. This also tells us that there are no solutions. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>8.5.3: Self Check</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>\n        <p>Solve the equation using any method covered in the lesson.</p>\n        <p>\\((x&minus;6)(x+5)=-30.25\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>No solutions</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incorrect.

If possible, try to use reasoning before graphing an equation.</p>\n<p>Let's look at some examples.</p>\n<p><strong>Using Reasoning and the Square Root Property</strong></p>\n<p>Equations such as these can be solved by reasoning and using the square root property.</p>\n<p>Example 1<br>\n  \\(x^2=81\\) <br>\n  \\(x=9\\) and \\(x=-9\\) </p>\n<p>Example 2 <br>\n  \\(x^2+7=56\\)<br>\n  \\(x^2=49\\)<br>\n  \\(x=7\\) and \\(x=-7\\)</p>\n<p>Example 3<br>\n  \\((x+1)^2=9\\)<br>\n  \\(x=2\\) and \\(x=-4\\)</p>\n<p>Each equation above is different in some way, but they all can be solved using the same process.</p>\n<p><strong>Using Reasoning and the Zero Product Property</strong></p>\n<p>Equations such as these can be solved by reasoning and using the zero product property.</p>\n<p>Example 1<br>\n  \\((x&minus;4)(x+5)=0\\)<br>\n  \\(x=4\\) and \\(x=-5\\)</p>\n<p>Example 2<br>\n  \\((x+3)(2x+7)=0\\)<br>\n  \\(x=-3\\) and \\(x=-72\\)</p>\n<p><strong>Using Graphing to Solve</strong></p>\n<p>Some equations might require graphing to be solved.
