Do not show or read your card to your partner.</p>\n<p>If your teacher gives you the data card:</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n<li> Silently read the information on your card. </li>\n<li> Ask your partner, \"What specific information do you need?\" and wait for your partner to ask for information. Only give information that is on your card. (Do not figure out anything for your partner!) </li>\n<li> Before telling your partner the information, ask, \"Why do you need to know (that piece of information)?\" </li>\n<li> Read the problem card and solve the problem independently. </li>\n<li> Share the data card and discuss your reasoning. </li>\n<li> Pause here so your teacher can review your work. Ask your teacher for a new set of cards and repeat the activity (steps 1&ndash;5) for the next problem, trading roles with your partner. </li>\n<li> When you and your partner have solved both problems, enter your answers to the questions below. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>If your teacher gives you the problem card:</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n<li> Silently read your card and think about what information you need to answer the question. </li>\n<li> Ask your partner for the specific information that you need. </li>\n<li> Explain to your partner how you are using the information to solve the problem. </li>\n<li> When you have enough information, share the problem card with your partner, and solve the problem independently. </li>\n<li> Read the data card and discuss your reasoning. </li>\n<li> Pause here so your teacher can review your work.
