The square root of 81 is 9.</p>\n<p>So, the factored form is \\((4m &minus; 9 )(4m + 9)\\).</p>\n<p>Again, we can multiply to check.</p>\n<p>\\((4m &minus; 9)(4m + 9)\\)<br>\n    \\(\\begin{array}{rcl}&amp;&amp;{= 4m^2 + 36m &minus; 36m &minus; 81\\\\= 4m^2 &minus; 81\\; {\\style{color:red}\\checkmark}}\\\\&amp;&amp;\\end{array}\\)</p>\n<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>\n<p>As we see in the activity, where the variable is located is not important as long as the quadratic binomial is still the difference of two squares.</p>\n<p>Write \\(64 &minus; 9b^2\\) in factored form.</p>\n<p>We use the same concept to find the factored form.</p>\n<p>\\(64 &minus; 9b^2= (8 &minus; 3b)(8 + 3b)\\)</p>\n<p>We can multiply to check.</p>\n<p>\\((8 &minus; 3b)(8 + 3b)\\)<br>\n    \\(\\begin{array}{rcl}&amp;&amp;{= 64 + 24b &minus; 24b &minus; 9b^2\\\\= 64 &minus; 9b^2\\; {\\style{color:red}\\checkmark}}\\\\&amp;&amp;\\end{array}\\)</p>\n<p>Remember that any expression of the form \\(x^2 + c\\) or \\(ax^2+ c\\) does not have a factored form!</p>\n<ul>\n<li> For \\(x^2+ c\\), the \\(c\\) is not squared, and the terms are not being subtracted. </li>\n<li> For \\(ax^2+ c\\), neither the \\(a\\) nor the \\(c\\) is a perfect square, and the terms are not being subtracted. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Try It: Factoring Quadratic Equations Without a Linear Term</h4>\n<br>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"Reveal1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-content\">\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n<li>Write \\(x^2&minus; 4\\) in factored form.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n<li>Write \\(100x^2&minus; 121\\) in factored form.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-prompt\">\n<p>Write down your answers, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-content\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\" data-wait-for-event=\"Reveal1\">\n<p>Here is how to write the expressions in factored form.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n<li>\\((x &minus; 2)(x + 2)\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n<li>\\((10x &minus; 11)(10x + 11)\\)</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"
