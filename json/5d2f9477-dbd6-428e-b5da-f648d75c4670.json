The dependent variable is the cost of parking.</li>\n<li>The cost of parking is a function of the amount of time a car is parked.</li>\n<li>2 hours of parking costs $6.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>The distance a person walks, \\(d\\), in kilometers, is a function of time, \\(t\\), in minutes, since the walk began.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Select all true statements about the input variable of this function.</p>\n<ol type=\"A\">\n<li>Distance is the input.</li>\n<li>Time of day is the input.</li>\n<li>Time since the person started walking is the input.</li>\n<li>\\(t\\) represents the input.</li>\n<li>\\(d\\) represents the input.</li>\n<li>The input is not measured in any particular unit.</li>\n<li>The input is measured in hours.</li>\n<li>For each input, there are sometimes two outputs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Time since the person started walking is the input; \\(t\\) represents the input.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Is the following relation a function?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>{\\((27,&minus;3),(8,&minus;2),(1,&minus;1),(0,0),(1,1),(8,2),(27,3)\\)}</p>\n<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>No. Since the input value, 1, goes to both &ndash;1 and 1, this relation is not a function.</p>\n<br>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Is the following relation a function? Explain your answer.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"This figure shows two table that each have one column. The table on the left has the header &ldquo;Name&rdquo; and lists the names &ldquo;Neal&rdquo;, &ldquo;Krystal&rdquo;, &ldquo;Kelvin&rdquo;, &ldquo;George&rdquo;, &ldquo;Christa&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Mike&rdquo;. The table on the right has the header &ldquo;Phone number&rdquo; and lists the numbers &ldquo;123-567-4389 work&rdquo;, &ldquo;231-378-5941 cell&rdquo;, &ldquo;753-469-9731 cell&rdquo;, &ldquo;567-534-2970 work&rdquo;, &ldquo;684-369-7231 cell&rdquo;, &ldquo;798-367-8541 cell&rdquo;, and &ldquo;639-847-6971 cell&rdquo;. There are arrows that start at a name and points toward a number in the phone number table. The first arrow goes from Neal to 753-469-9731 cell. The second arrow goes from Krystal to a 684-369-7231 cell. The third arrow goes from Kelvin to 231-378-5941 cell. The fourth arrow goes from George to 123-567-4389 work.

Since both George and Mike are mapped to two different phone numbers, every input does not have exactly one output value.</p>\n<br>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Is the following relation a function?
