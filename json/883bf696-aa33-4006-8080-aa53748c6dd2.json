You modeled and graphed the relationship as a quadratic function that showed the revenue as a function of the price of the download. You used this function, referred to as the demand function, to predict profit price points. </li>\n      <li> 7.7.2: Self Check </li>\n      <li> 7.7.2: Additional Resources </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li> 7.7.3: The Domain, Vertex, and Zero of Quadratic Functions\n    <ul>\n      <li>In this activity, you looked at appropriate domains for quadratic functions given the situations they represented. You identified and estimated the vertex of the graph and the zeros of the functions. You used modeling and graphing to interpret upper or lower limits for the input, as well as whether all numbers made sense.</li>\n      <li> 7.7.3: Self Check </li>\n      <li> 7.7.3: Additional Resources </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li> 7.7.4: Relate the Domain of a Function to Its Graph\n    <ul>\n      <li> In this activity, you analyzed a graph that represented the revenue that a company would expect to see if they sell their product at a certain price. You used this information to determine an appropriate domain for the function of the graph. </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 7.7.5: Practice </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <!--pulldown-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n      <p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n      <p>Correct!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n      <p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!--Do not edit below line.-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n</div>"
