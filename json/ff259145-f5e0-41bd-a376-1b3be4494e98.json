After 30 minutes, the pot is taken off the stove.</p>\n<p>The graph of the function is shown.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"graph of temperature of water over time\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/im-ims-export/DAHUmXot8XWXoJDfSyT4fTQW\"></p>\n<ol>\n<li> Is 250 in the range of function \\(W\\)? Explain how you know. </li>\n<li> Describe the range of the function. </li>\n<li> Does \\(W(t)=0\\) have a solution? Explain how you know. </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<ol>\n<li> No, 250 is not in the range. The highest temperature is 212 degrees Fahrenheit. </li>\n<li> The range is all values between 75 and 212, the lowest and the highest temperature, \\(75\\leq y\\leq212.\\) </li>\n<li> No, a solution to this equation would be the time when the temperature is 0 degrees Fahrenheit, which is never the case. </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>\n<h5>More Chances</h5>\n<p>If students are still struggling with domain and range, examine errors in the cool-down and make sure to discuss domain and range during each of the activities in Lesson 13.</p>"
