Students analyze various examples of perfect squares. They apply the distributive property repeatedly to expand perfect-square expressions given in factored form. The repeated reasoning allows them to generalize expressions of the form \\((x+n)^2\\) as equivalent to \\(x^2+2nx+n^2\\).</p>\n<p>The second aim is to help students see that perfect squares can be handy for solving equations because we can find their square roots.</p>\n<p>Achieving these aims prepares students to solve quadratic equations by completing the square in upcoming lessons. Knowing that quadratic equations can be much more easily solved when one side is a perfect square and the other side is a number motivates students to transform expressions into that form. Recognizing the structure of a perfect square equips students to look for features that are necessary to complete a square.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Comprehend that equations containing a perfect-square expression on both sides of the equal sign can be solved by finding square roots. </li>\n  <li> Comprehend that perfect squares of the form \\((x+n)^2\\) are equivalent to \\(x^2+2nx+n^2\\). </li>\n  <li> Use the structure of expressions to identify them as perfect squares. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Recognize perfect-square expressions written in different forms. </li>\n  <li> Recognize quadratic equations that have a perfect-square expression and solve the equations. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>A11(A) simplify numerical radical expressions involving square roots;</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>A8(A) <u>solve quadratic equations having real solutions by</u> factoring, <u>taking square roots</u>, completing the square, and applying the quadratic formula.</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Partial coverage: Lesson provides content that covers part of this TEKS.
