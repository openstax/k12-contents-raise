In this activity, students will convert from a function's zeros to its factored form and standard form. Students will also practice this process after analyzing the graph of a quadratic function.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Answer questions 1&ndash;3 to familiarize students with the process of converting from zeros to the standard form of a function. Pause and allow students to ask any questions. Then allow each pair to complete questions 4&ndash;11 on their own. Emphasize that questions 9&ndash;11 are the same as the preceding questions, except that students must analyze the graph to find the zeros.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>In previous lessons, you learned about the relationship between a quadratic function's zeros and the binomial factors in the factored form of the equation. Use this information to answer the following questions.

Remind students these are double roots, where the same solution is represented twice. If another hint is needed, tell students that in the factored form for each question, the binomial will repeat itself.</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>To review key ideas from the activity, discuss the following questions:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li>\"Can you convert directly from the zeros of a function to standard form?\" (No, the zeros of a function can be converted into factored form, which can then be converted into standard form.) </li>\n  <li>\"How can you convert the graph of a quadratic function into its standard form?\" (Analyze the graph to find the zeros, or solutions, of the function. Use the zeros to write the function in factored form. Use FOIL to write the factored form in standard form.) </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>8.11.2: Self Check&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n        <p>Identify a quadratic function, \\(g(x)\\), in standard form, that has the zeros 5 and &ndash;7.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(g(x) = x^2 + 2x &minus; 35\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>That's correct!
