You also had to justify your response and decide what information would make it easier to determine if the graph was linear or exponential. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 5.14.2: Using Tables to Compare Linear and Exponential Growth Functions </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> In this activity, you compared linear and exponential growth in a context involving simple and compound interest. You were also required to analyze the necessary mathematics in the context of a real-world situation and justify your choices. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 5.14.2: Self Check&nbsp; </li>\n  <li> 5.14.3: Compare Linear Functions with Exponential Functions&nbsp; </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> In this activity, you compared a linear function with an exponential one without a context, and you noticed that the exponential function grew much more slowly over a long period of time. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 5.14.3: Self Check&nbsp; </li>\n  <li> 5.14.4: Using Function Notation to Compare Linear and Exponential Functions </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> In this activity, you explored approaches to estimate values to compare the two functions when only the equations are provided. </li>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 5.14.5: Practice </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-content-id=\"c8fb092d-cbfb-43d1-95b4-73e90337f586\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <!--pulldown-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-content-id=\"defdc5b4-ddb3-48cd-ae17-8af6c3ea905c\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n      <p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n      <p>Correct!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n      <p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!--Do not edit below line.-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n</div>"
