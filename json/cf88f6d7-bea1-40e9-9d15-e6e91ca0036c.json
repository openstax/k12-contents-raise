The aim is to preview the calculations that are the source of some common errors in solving equations using the quadratic formula, which students will analyze in the next activity.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Encourage and support opportunities for peer interactions. Invite students to talk about their ideas with a partner before writing them down.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>Evaluate each expression for \\(a=9\\), \\(b=-5\\), and \\(c=-2\\).</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n<li>\\(-b\\)</li></ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 5</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n<li>\\(b^2\\)</li></ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 25<br>\n\t\\((-5)^2=25\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\">\n<li>\\(b^2&minus;4ac\\)</li></ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 97<br>\n\t\\((-5)^2&minus;4(9)(-2)=25-(36)(-2)=25-(-72)=25+72=97\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"4\">\n<li>Select two answers for \\(-b \\pm \\sqrt{a}\\).</li></ol>\n<ul>\n<li> -14 </li>\n<li> 8 </li>\n<li> 2 </li>\n<li> 4 </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 2, 8<br>\n\t\\(-(-5)+\\sqrt{9}=5+3=8\\) and \\(-(-5)-\\sqrt{9}=5-3=2\\)</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Invite students to share their responses and discuss any disagreement. For each expression, ask if they can think of an error someone might make when evaluating such an expression. Some possible errors:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> \\(-b\\): Forgetting that \\(-b\\) is really \\(-1(b)\\) and the product of two negative numbers is positive. </li>\n<li> \\(b^2\\): When \\(b\\) is -5, evaluating \\(-(5)^2\\), instead of \\((-5)^2\\). </li>\n<li> \\(b^2&minus;4ac\\): Forgetting that subtracting by \\(4ac\\) is equivalent to adding \\(-4ac\\), or neglecting to see that if \\(c\\) is negative, \\(-4ac\\) is positive, not negative. </li>\n<li> \\(-b \\pm \\sqrt{a}\\): Neglecting the negative in front of \\(b\\), or neglecting to see that the expression takes two different values. Tell students that in the next activity, they will spot some errors in solving quadratic equations. </li>\n</ul>"
