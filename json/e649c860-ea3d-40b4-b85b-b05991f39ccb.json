You will also review the ties between the zeros of a function and the horizontal intercepts of its graph, which you began exploring in an earlier unit.</p>\n<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> Explain why dividing by a variable to solve a quadratic equation is not a good strategy. </li>\n<li> Explain why quadratic equations can have no solutions and explain why there are none. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are the<strong> activities </strong>that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> 8.5.1: Reviewing Zero Product Property </li>\n<li> 8.5.2: Interpreting Graphs to Solve Quadratic Equations </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 8.5.2: Self Check </li>\n<li> 8.5.2: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 8.5.3: Choosing an Effective Strategy to Solve Quadratic Equations </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 8.5.3: Self Check </li>\n<li> 8.5.3: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 8.5.4: Analyzing Errors When Solving Quadratic Equations </li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll<strong> practice and review</strong>.</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> 8.5.5: Practice </li>\n<li> 8.5.6: Lesson Summary </li>\n</ul>"
