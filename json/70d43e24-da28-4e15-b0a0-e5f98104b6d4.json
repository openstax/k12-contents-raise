In this lesson, they continue to work with patterns but begin to see these relationships as quadratic functions and write equations to define them.</p>\n<p>Students recognize that different expressions can be used to describe the same function. Previously, they learned that an expression like \\(n^2+2n\\) is a quadratic expression. Here they see that \\(n(n+2)\\) defines the same function as \\(n^2+2n\\), so \\(n(n+2)\\) is also a quadratic expression. The work here is a preview to a more formal exploration of equivalent expressions later.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Comprehend that the same quadratic function can be expressed symbolically in different ways. </li>\n  <li> Interpret (using words and other representations) the quadratic relationships in growing patterns as functions, where each input gives a particular output. </li>\n  <li> Write expressions that define quadratic functions. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li> Recognize quadratic functions written in different ways. </li>\n  <li> Use information from a pattern of shapes to write a quadratic function. </li>\n  <li> Know that, in a pattern of shapes, the step number is the input and the number of squares is the output. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>A7(A) graph quadratic functions on the coordinate plane and use the graph to identify key attributes, if possible, including \\(x\\)-intercept, \\(y\\)-intercept, zeros, maximum value, minimum values, vertex, and the equation of the axis of symmetry.</p>\n        <p>A6(B) write equations of quadratic functions given the vertex and another point on the graph, write the equation in vertex form \\((f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k)\\), and rewrite the equation from vertex form to standard form \\((f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c)\\).</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Foundational: Lesson provides foundational content necessary for students to be able to perform this TEKS in later lessons.</p>\n        <p>Foundational: Lesson provides foundational content necessary for students to be able to perform this TEKS in later lessons.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 7.3.1: Quadratic Expressions and Area </li>\n  <li> 7.3.2: Writing Equations for Patterns with Squares </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> 7.3.2: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 7.3.2: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 7.3.3: Quadratic Sequences </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> 7.3.3: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 7.3.3: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 7.3.4: Quadratic Function? </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 7.3.5: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<p>None</p>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<p>None</p>\n<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson.
