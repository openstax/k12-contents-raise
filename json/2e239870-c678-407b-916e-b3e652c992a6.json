You will then use the GCF to factor these expressions. In some cases, you will need to group terms together so that the expressions can be factored. These skills will allow you to rewrite expressions into a simpler, fully factored form.</p>\n<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Find the greatest common factor of two or more expressions. </li>\n<li> Factor the greatest common factor from a polynomial. </li>\n<li> Factor by grouping. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are the<strong> activities </strong>that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 6.4.1: Finding Factors </li>\n<li> 6.4.2: Finding the GCF of Two or More Expressions </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 6.4.2: Self Check </li>\n<li>6.4.2: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n<li> 6.4.3: Factoring the GCF from Polynomials </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 6.4.3: Self Check </li>\n<li>6.4.3: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n<li> 6.4.4: Factoring Polynomials by Grouping </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 6.4.4: Self Check </li>\n<li>6.4.4: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n<li> 6.4.5: Can You Factor the Polynomial? </li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 6.4.6: Practice </li>\n<li> 6.4.7: Lesson Summary </li>\n</ul>"
