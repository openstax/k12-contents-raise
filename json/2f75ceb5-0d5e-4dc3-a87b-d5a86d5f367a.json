Discuss questions such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"Of the four things you were asked to do in the last activity-writing an inequality, graphing the solutions, identifying and interpreting a particular solution, and answering the question about the situation-which one did you find most challenging or prone to error?\"</li>\n<li>\"How is graphing linear inequalities using technology similar to graphing them by hand? How is it different?\"</li>\n<li>\"You have previously used technology to graph linear equations in two variables. How is graphing linear inequalities in two variables different than graphing equations?\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n</div><br>"
