They will eventually try to model these city populations with an appropriate linear or exponential function, but the starting point for any model is to ask questions about and observe general trends in the data.</p>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement </h4>\n<p>Here are the populations of three cities during different years.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"81\">\n    <col width=\"91\">\n    <col width=\"91\">\n    <col width=\"91\">\n    <col width=\"91\">\n    <col width=\"91\">\n    <col width=\"91\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p><strong>City</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p><strong>1950</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p><strong>1960</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p><strong>1970</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p><strong>1980</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p><strong>1990</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p><strong>2000</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>Paris</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>6,300,000</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>7,400,000</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>8,200,000</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>8,700,000</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>9,300,000</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>9,700,000</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>Austin</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>132,000</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>187,000</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>254,000</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>346,000</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>466,000</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>657,000</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>Chicago</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>3,600,000</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>3,550,000</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>3,400,000</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>3,000,000</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>2,800,000</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>2,900,000</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p>What do you notice?

For example:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Paris has been growing steadily but not at a constant rate. </li>\n  <li> Austin has been growing very rapidly. </li>\n  <li> Chicago's population has decreased at a variable rate, but it increased in the decade from 1990 to 2000. </li>\n</ul>"
