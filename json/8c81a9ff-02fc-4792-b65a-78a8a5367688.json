The closer the correlation coefficient value is to 0, the worse the best fit line fits the data. The closer the correlation coefficient is to 1 or &ndash;1, the better the best fit line fits the data.</span></li>\n  <li>&ndash;0.8, since the data appears to be decreasing and a line is an okay fit for the data, but it is not perfect.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Response to Student Thinking</span><br></p>\n<p><span>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</span><br></p>\n<p><br></p>"
