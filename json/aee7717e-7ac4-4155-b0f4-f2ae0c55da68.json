She has to work at least 5 hours a week to keep the job, and she can earn up to $175 per week, including $10 to cover transportation per week.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-403188fc-7fff-1030-a1f7-10c3084b7612\"><span>Represent this situation mathematically. If you use variables, specify what each one means.</span></span></li>\n<li><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-403188fc-7fff-1030-a1f7-10c3084b7612\"><span>How many hours per week can Lin work? Explain your reasoning.</span></span></li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n</ol>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-403188fc-7fff-1030-a1f7-10c3084b7612\"><span>\\(8.25h\\;+\\;10\\;\\leq\\;175\\) and \\(h\\;\\geq\\;5\\), where \\(h\\) represents the number of hours Lin works in a week.</span></span></li>\n<li><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-403188fc-7fff-1030-a1f7-10c3084b7612\"><span>At least 5 hours and at most 20 hours (or \\(5\\leq\\;h\\;\\leq20\\)). For example: The maximum amount she could earn, not including the transportation allowance, is $165. That amount is equal to 20 hours of work \\((\\frac{165}{8.25}=20)\\).</span></span></li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n</ol>\n<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>\n<h5>More Chances</h5>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Students will have more opportunities in Lesson 2.12 (Solving Problems with Inequalities in Two Variables) to write inequalities to represent a situation.</p>\n</span><br><br>"
