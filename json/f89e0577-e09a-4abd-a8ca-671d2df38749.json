There were a few instances in which students rewrote expressions in standard form with a leading coefficient other than 1. Those expressions were differences of two squares, where there were no linear terms (for instance, \\(9x^2&minus; 64\\) or \\(25x^2&minus; 9\\)). Students learned to rewrite these as \\((3x + 8)(3x &minus; 8)\\) or \\((5x + 3)(5x &minus; 3)\\), respectively.</p>\n<p>In this lesson, students consider how to rewrite expressions in standard form where the leading coefficient is not 1 and the expression is not a difference of two squares. They notice that the same structure used to rewrite \\(x^2+ 5x + 4\\) as \\((x + 4)(x + 1)\\) can be used to rewrite expressions such as \\(3x^2+ 8x + 4\\), but the process is now a little more involved because the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) has to be taken into account when finding the right pair of factors.</p>\n<p>This lesson aims to give students a flavor of rewriting more complicated expressions in factored form, and to suggest that it is not always practical or possible. This experience motivates the need for other strategies for solving equations and prepares students to complete the square in a series of upcoming lessons.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Write an equivalent expression in factored form given a quadratic expression of the form \\(ax^2+ bx + c\\), where \\(a\\) is not 1. </li>\n  <li> Write a quadratic equation that represents a context, consider different methods for solving it, and describe (orally) the limitations of each method. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Use the factored form of a quadratic expression or a graph of a quadratic function to answer questions about a situation. </li>\n  <li> Write equivalent expressions in factored form when given quadratic expressions of the form \\(ax^2+ bx + c\\) and \\(a\\) is not 1. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>A8(A) solve quadratic equations having real solutions by factoring, taking square roots, completing the square, and applying the quadratic formula.</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Foundational: Lesson provides foundational content necessary for students to be able to perform this TEKS in later lessons.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> 8.10.1: Analyzing Various Quadratic Expressions </li>\n  <li> 8.10.2: Working with Quadratic Factored Form with Leading Coefficient Other Than One </li>\n  <ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n    <li> 8.10.2: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 8.10.2: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 8.10.3: Using Technology to Find Rational Factors </li>\n  <ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n    <li> 8.10.3: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 8.10.3: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 8.10.4: Finding the Factors of Quadratic Expressions in Standard Form </li>\n  <ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n    <li> 8.10.4: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 8.10.4: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 8.10.5: Solving Quadratic Equations by Any Method </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 8.10.6: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Paper and pencil </li>\n  <li> Graphing technology </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Acquire devices that can run Desmos (recommended) or other graphing technology.
