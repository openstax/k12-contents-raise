This activity prompts students to check the solutions to quadratic equations and to recognize that there is more than one way to do so. Different approaches include substituting solutions to see if the equation is true, solving using a different algebraic method, or solving by graphing.</p>\n<p>Monitor for students who verify the solutions to the equation \\(2+30t&minus;5t^2=47\\) by:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Solving the equation using another algebraic method and seeing if they get the same solutions. For instance, if they used the quadratic formula initially, they might choose to solve again by completing the square or by rewriting the equation in factored form. </li>\n  <li> Substituting the solutions for \\(t\\) in the equation and seeing if the equation is true. </li>\n  <li> Graphing \\(y=2+30t&minus;5t^2\\) and \\(y=47\\) and seeing if the horizontal coordinates of the intersections match those of the solutions. </li>\n  <li> Graphing \\(y=-45+30t&minus;5t^2\\) and checking the horizontal intercepts of the graph. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Identify students who use contrasting methods and ask them to share during discussion. The algebraic strategies are more precise but could lead to errors if the computations are performed incorrectly. The graphing strategies can be accomplished quickly with the use of technology but may only give approximate solutions.</p>\n<p>Making calculators and graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Keep students in groups of two. Ask students to think quietly about each question before conferring with their partner. Encourage partners to consider different ways of checking their solutions.</p>\n<p>If time is limited, consider asking half of the class to answer the first question and the other half to answer the second question.</p>\n<p>Provide access to calculators for numerical computations and to graphing technology, in case requested for solution checking.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>The equation \\(h(t)=2+30t&minus;5t^2\\) represents the height, as a function of time, of a pumpkin that was catapulted up in the air.

Sample responses include:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Substitute 3 for \\(t\\) in the original expression; evaluating it gives \\(2+30(3)&minus;5(3)^2\\) or \\(2+90&minus;45\\), which is 47. </li>\n  <li> Graphing \\(y=2+30t&minus;5t^2\\) and \\(y=47\\) shows an intersection is located at \\((3,47)\\). </li>\n  <li> Graphing \\(y=-45+30t&minus;5t^2\\) shows a zero at \\((3,0)\\). </li>\n</ul>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n  <li>The equation \\(r(p)=80p&minus;p^2\\) models the revenue a band expects to collect as a function of the price of one concert ticket.

Sample responses include:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Partially agree. A ticket price of $15.50 will generate about $1000 in revenue, but a ticket price of $74.50 will generate much less (about $410). </li>\n  <li> Using the quadratic formula to solve \\(1000=80p&minus;p^2\\) gives \\(p \\approx 15.50\\) and \\(p \\approx 64.50\\) as the solutions. </li>\n  <li> Substituting 15.50 into the expression \\(80p&minus;p^2\\) gives 999.75, which is close to 1000. \\((80(15.50)&minus;(15.50)2=999.75)\\). Substituting 74.50 into the expression \\(80p&minus;p^2\\) gives 409.75. </li>\n  <li> Graphing the equation \\(y=r(p)\\) and \\(y=1000\\) shows two intersections at approximately \\((15.50,1000)\\) and \\((64.50,1000)\\). </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Video: Explaining Your Solutions to Quadratic Situations</h4>\n<p>Watch the following video to learn more about proving quadratic solutions.</p>\n<video controls=\"true\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" width=\"550\">\n  <source src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/53a8917c8b3418a7473a16ad7d50f607dfbe26ea\">\n  <track default=\"true\" kind=\"captions\" label=\"On\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/86979958a6e38c2c55550540a5d307b3cea626ef\" srclang=\"en_us\">https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/53a8917c8b3418a7473a16ad7d50f607dfbe26ea\n</video>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h4>Student-Facing Extension</h4>\n<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>Function \\(g\\) is defined by the equation \\(g(t)=2+30t&minus;5t^2&minus;47\\).

Solving \\(-5t^2+30t&minus;45=0\\) using the quadratic formula gives \\(t=3\\). </li>\n  <li> \\(-5t^2+30t&minus;45\\) can be rewritten as \\(-5(t^2&minus;6t+9)\\) and then as \\(-5(t&minus;3)(t&minus;3)\\). Applying the zero product property to solve \\(-5(t&minus;3)(t&minus;3)=0\\) gives \\(t=3\\). </li>\n</ul>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n  <li>Explain or show how the zeros you found can tell us the vertex of the graph of \\(g\\).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Function \\(g\\) only has one zero, which means its graph has only one horizontal intercept, occurring when \\(t=3\\). Because the point \\((3,0)\\) is the only intercept, it must also be the vertex of the graph, otherwise there would have been either two horizontal intercepts, or none.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\">\n  <li>Recall that \\(g(t)=2+30t&minus;5t^2&minus;47\\) and \\(h(t)=2+30t&minus;5t^2\\). Examine these functions \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) (which defined the height of the pumpkin). Explain how the maximum of function \\(h\\), once we know it, can tell us the maximum of \\(g\\).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The value of the expression for \\(g\\) is 47 less than that of \\(h\\), so if we know the maximum of \\(h\\), we know that the maximum of \\(g\\) is 47 less than that. We saw that the maximum of \\(h\\) is 47, so the maximum of \\(g\\) is 47 less than 47, which is 0.</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Select previously identified students to present the different ways in which they checked their solutions. Sequence their presentations based on the precision of the verification (from more precise to less precise), as shown in the Activity Narrative. Highlight as many different strategies as time permits.</p>\n<p>If no one mentions solving with a different strategy or graphing as ways to verify solutions, bring these up. Display a graph such as this one to show that the graph can immediately show that 74.50 is not a solution to the equation \\(80p&minus;p^2=1000\\), but 64.50 is very, very close.</p>\n<p><img height=\"450\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/e968ea55a35116b5cdb459a859a70173d3f2064d\"></p>\n<p>Many students may have chosen to substitute the solutions back into the equation as a way to check them. Acknowledge that this is a very useful strategy for checking, but it also has its limits. Sometimes the solutions are not rational numbers-for example, \\(x=2 \\pm \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{10}\\). Substituting such an expression back into the equation and evaluating it would mean complicated computations, which may themselves be subject to errors.</p>\n<p>We could approximate the values of expressions like \\(x=2 \\pm \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{10}\\) and write them as decimals before checking. This is a workable strategy if a calculator is handy.</p>\n<h3>9.7.3: Self Check</h3>\n<em><strong>\n    <p>Following the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</p>\n  </strong></em>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>\n        <p>The equation \\(g(t) = 2 + 23.7t - 4.9t^2\\) models the height, in meters, of a pumpkin \\(t\\) seconds after it has been launched from a catapult.
