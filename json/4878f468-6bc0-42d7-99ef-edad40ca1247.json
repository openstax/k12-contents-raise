Instead, use the results of this to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding. Both Lessons 4 and 5 include arithmetic and geometric sequences for students to practice identifying and generating, but the focus is on new aspects (spreadsheets and functions), so you&rsquo;ll have to adjust the activities to address this goal.</p>"
