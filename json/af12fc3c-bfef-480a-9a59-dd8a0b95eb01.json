He believes that by producing longer-lasting batteries for our mobile devices and our cars, we can reduce our overall energy consumption. Mr. Das can use functions to help him calculate energy inputs and outputs. </p>\n<p>In this section, you will expand your understanding of functions. You will use function notation to represent statements about a function and interpret statements in function notation in terms of a situation. You will learn that some functions can be defined with a rule and that the rule can be expressed in function notation. You will use the rule of a function to find the output when the input is given.</p>\n<p>This section includes 5 lessons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4.1 Describing and Graphing Situations</li>\n<li>4.2 Function Notation</li>\n<li>4.3 Interpreting &amp; Using Function Notation</li>\n<li>4.4 Using Function Notation to Describe Rules, Part 1</li>\n<li>4.5 Using Function Notation to Describe Rules, Part 2</li>\n</ul>"
