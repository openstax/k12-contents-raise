As students gain familiarity with these polynomial expressions, they will learn to recognize like terms within these expressions and combine them whenever possible. Students will also be able to perform these same operations while representing polynomials using function notation.</p>\n<h4> Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Classify different types of polynomials as well as determine their degree. </li>\n  <li> Fluently add and subtract polynomials by combining like terms whenever possible. </li>\n  <li> Use function notation to represent polynomial functions and evaluate these functions for given values. </li>\n  <li> Fluently add and subtract polynomial functions while checking their work. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li> Determine the degree of polynomials. </li>\n  <li> Add and subtract polynomials. </li>\n  <li> Evaluate a polynomial function for a given value. </li>\n  <li> Add and subtract polynomial functions. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>A10(A) add and subtract polynomials of degree one and degree two;</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4> Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 6.1.1: Understanding Polynomials </li>\n  <li> 6.1.2: Adding and Subtracting Polynomials </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> 6.1.2: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 6.1.2: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 6.1.3: Evaluating a Polynomial Function for a Given Value </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> 6.1.3: Self Check</li>\n    <li> 6.1.3: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 6.1.4: Adding and Subtracting Polynomial Functions </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> 6.1.4: Self Check</li>\n    <li> 6.1.4: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 6.1.5 Reviewing Polynomial Addition and Subtraction </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 6.1.6: Practice.</p>\n<h4> Required Materials</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>Paper and pencil </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>None </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson.
