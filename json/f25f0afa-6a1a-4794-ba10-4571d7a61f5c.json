Students trade roles, explaining their thinking and listening, providing opportunities to explain their reasoning and critique the reasoning of others. They should begin to recognize that a plot of the residuals for data that are fit well by a linear model shows residuals that are close to the \\(x\\)-axis and do not show a noticeable trend.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Arrange students in groups of 2. Demonstrate how to set up and find matches. Choose a student to be your partner. Mix up the cards and place them face up. Point out that the cards contain either a scatter plot with a linear model or a graph of the residuals. Select one of each style of card and then explain to your partner why you think the cards do or do not match. Demonstrate productive ways to collaborate, by agreeing or respectfully disagreeing. Start out by explaining your own mathematical thinking and asking clarifying questions. Give each group a set of cut-up cards for matching.</p>\n<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>\n<div>\n  <p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Writing, Conversing: MLR1 Stronger and Clearer Each Time. </em>Use this routine to help students improve their writing by providing them with multiple opportunities to clarify their explanations through conversation. Give students time to meet with 2&ndash;3 partners to share their response to the last question. Students should first check to see if they agree with each other about who had the better estimate of the line of best fit. Provide listeners with prompts for feedback that will help their partner add detail to strengthen and clarify their ideas. For example, students can ask their partner: &ldquo;How did you use the graph of the residuals to make your decision?&rdquo; or &rdquo;How do you know . . . ?&rdquo; Next, provide students with 3&ndash;4 minutes to revise their initial draft based on feedback from their peers. This will help students produce a written justification for determining best estimates of lines of best fit.</p>\n  <p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Design Principle(s): Support sense-making; Optimize output (for explanation</em>)</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n<div>\n  <p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Representation: Internalize Comprehension.</em> Represent the same information through different modalities by showing the relationship between the original graph and the graph of the residuals. Provide students with tracing paper (to use directly over the card) or graph paper (to recreate the card) so they can draw in the distance between the point and the line to see the residuals.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Supports accessibility for: Conceptual processing; Visual-spatial processing</em></p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Match the scatter plots and given linear models to the graph of the residuals.</li>\n  <li>Turn over the scatter plots so that only the residuals are visible. Based on the residuals, which line would produce the most accurate estimates? Which line fits its data worst?</li>\n</ol>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>&nbsp;<ol type=\"a\">\n      <li>A matches with K</li>\n      <li>B matches with G</li>\n      <li>C matches with L</li>\n      <li>D matches with H</li>\n      <li>E matches with J</li>\n      <li>F matches with I</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li>B fits its data the best. C or E fits its data the worst.</li>\n</ol>\n<p></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;<span>What Do Residual Plots Tell Us?</span></p>\n<p>Residuals tell us how accurate a line of best fit really is.</p>\n<p>Ideally, the residual from a line of best fit will be scattered randomly above and below the horizontal line of 0 on the residual plot. The residual plot would have points above and below the horizontal line of 0. This shows that the relationship between the two variables in the data set can be approximated by a linear model.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When a residual is on 0, this indicates that the line of best fit goes through its corresponding point.</p>\n<p>A curved pattern shows that a nonlinear model would be better to describe the relationships between points.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Student-Facing Extension</h4>\n<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>\n<h5>Line of Best Fit</h5>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Tyler estimates a line of best fit for some linear data about the mass, in grams, of different numbers of apples.

Explain your reasoning.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>The goal is to make sure students understand the connections between a scatter plot displaying a linear model and a graph of the residuals. A good linear model for the data will have residuals that are scattered on either side of the \\(x\\)-axis without a clear pattern and close to the axis.</p>\n<p>Much discussion takes place between partners. Invite students to share how they made the matches.</p>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>&ldquo;What were some ways you handled finding the matches for B and C? Recall that B and C used the same data but different linear models.&rdquo; (The line in C was not as good of a fit as line B, so I knew the graph of the residuals would be farther away from the horizontal axis.)</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;Look at the matches for E and J. How can you tell from the graph of the residuals that the linear model is not a line of best fit?&rdquo; (The first half of the residuals are positive, and the second half are negative. This lets me know that the line does not pass through the middle of the data.)</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;What do you notice about the residuals in graph K? Explain what you notice in the context of scatter plot A.&rdquo; (The residuals go in a u-shaped pattern. The data in the scatter plot do not appear linear and are curved, so when you plot a line through them, you would expect the residuals to show the curvature.)</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;Describe any difficulties you experienced and how you resolved them.&rdquo; (It was tough figuring out how to decide where to begin when finding matches. I used my partner&rsquo;s strategy of looking at the values on the \\(x\\)-axis to help narrow down the choices.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<h3>3.3.3: Self Check&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<p></p><strong>\n  <div align=\"left\" dir=\"ltr\">\n    <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n      <colgroup>\n        <col width=\"302\">\n        <col width=\"322\">\n      </colgroup>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td colspan=\"2\">\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">QUESTION:&nbsp;</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Which residual plot shows the most accurate line of best fit for a scatter plot?</span></p><br>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">ANSWERS</p>\n          </td>\n          <td>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">FEEDBACK</p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td><br>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt class=\"img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom\" height=\"176\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/59c32c1a7c427cbda9da367abf7eac41ecddc741\" width=\"215\"></p>\n          </td>\n          <td>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Incorrect.
