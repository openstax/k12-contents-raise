The work of this lesson connects to previous work because\n  students learned how to read and interpret the correlation coefficient. The\n  work of this lesson connects to upcoming work because students will learn to\n  distinguish between correlation and causation.</p>\n<p>When students use the value of the\n  correlation coefficient to describe the relationship between two variables,\n  they are looking for and making use of structure. To make sense of the\n  relationship between variables, students reason abstractly and quantitatively.\n  When students examine relationships to think about correlations, they also\n  consider additional variables that might have an influence on any trends they\n  see. Deciding which variables need to be included is a part of the process of\n  modeling with mathematics.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Describe\n    (orally and in writing) the strength and sign of the relationship between\n    variables based on the correlation coefficient.</li>\n<li>Use\n    technology to calculate the correlation coefficient and describe the strength\n    of a relationship based on that value.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Describe\n    the strength of a relationship between two variables.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use\n      technology to find the correlation coefficient and explain what the value tells you about a linear model in everyday language.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"624\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"312\">\n<p align=\"center\"><b>TEKS</b></p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"312\">\n<p align=\"center\"><b>Explanation\n            of Coverage</b></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"312\">\n<p>4(A) calculate, using technology, the correlation\n          coefficient between two quantitative variables and interpret this quantity as\n          a measure of the strength of the linear association.</p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"312\">\n<p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this\n          TEKS.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"312\">\n<p>4(C) write, with and without technology, linear\n          functions that provide a reasonable fit to data to estimate solutions and\n          make predictions for real-world problems.</p>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\" width=\"312\">\n<p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this\n          TEKS.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><br>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Graphing technology</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional\n  activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3.5.0: Lesson Overview</li>\n<li>3.5.1: Using Bivariate Data in\n    Context</li>\n<li>3.5.2: Interpreting&nbsp;the Strength of\n    Linear Relationships\n    <ul>\n<li>3.5.2: Self Check</li>\n<li>3.5.2: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>3.5.3: Describing&nbsp;Relationships between Two\n    Variables\n    <ul>\n<li>3.5.3: Self Check</li>\n<li>3.5.3: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>3.5.4: Interpreting the Correlation Coefficient</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also\n  complete a series of problems in the 3.5.5: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<p>Students should have access to\n  graphing technology that can compute the least-squares regression line and\n  correlation coefficient from a set of bivariate data. Acquire devices that can\n  run Desmos (recommended) or other graphing technology. It is ideal if each\n  student has their own device. (Desmos is available under Math Tools.)</p>\n<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p>During this lesson, it is\n  important to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see\n    throughout the lesson. Encourage students to look for these words and notice\n    their use and meanings.</li>\n<li>Encourage students to use key vocabulary words in &ldquo;math talk&rdquo; and\n    their written and oral explanations.</li>\n<li>Utilize a word wall.
