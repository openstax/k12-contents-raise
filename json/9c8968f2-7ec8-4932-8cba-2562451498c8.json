While these polynomials can be factored using the methods from the previous lesson, these special cases allow for a more streamlined approach to factoring. One important skill that you will develop is the ability to recognize when you have a polynomial that fits into these special cases.</p>\n<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Factor perfect square trinomials.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Factor differences of squares.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    6.6.1: Identifying Perfect Square Trinomials\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    6.6.2: Factoring Perfect Square Trinomials\n  </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      6.6.2: Self Check\n    </li>\n    <li>6.6.2: Additional Resources</li>\n  </ul>\n  <li>\n    6.6.3: Factoring the Difference of Squares\n  </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      6.6.3: Self Check\n\n    </li>\n    <li>6.6.3: Additional Resources</li>\n  </ul>\n  <li>\n    6.6.4: Sorting Polynomials by Factoring Methods\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    6.6.5: Practice\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    6.6.6: Lesson Summary\n  </li>\n</ul>"
