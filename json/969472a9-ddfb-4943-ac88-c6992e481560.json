The properties of exponents determine how this process goes.) </li>\n<li> &ldquo;How is the Distributive Property used to multiply polynomials?&rdquo; (Each term in one polynomial is distributed through a second polynomial using multiplication. Like terms are combined to simplify the product.) </li>\n<li> &ldquo;How is Vertical Alignment used to multiply polynomials?&rdquo; (Polynomials are written vertically in a traditional multiplication format. The individual products from the multiplication of each term are added together to find the final product.) </li>\n<li> &ldquo;How is the FOIL method used to multiply polynomials?&rdquo; (The FOIL method is specifically used to multiply two binomials. A four-step process is used, first-outside-inside-last, to ensure that each term is multiplied together. Like terms are combined to simplify the product.) </li>\n<li> &ldquo;How is recognizing binomial squares and conjugate pairs helpful in polynomial multiplication?&rdquo; (These two situations represent special cases of binomial multiplication in which the products fit very particular patterns. This helps us take a small shortcut in finding and organizing the final product of these binomials.) </li>\n</ul>"
