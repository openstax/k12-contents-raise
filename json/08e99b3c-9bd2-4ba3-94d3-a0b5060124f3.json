By determining that the equation was still true, you discovered that adding equivalent values to each side of an equation maintains its truth.\n        </li>\n</ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n        2.4.2: Adding Two Equations in a System\n    </li>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\">\n            In this activity, you wrote equations to represent constraints in a real-world situation. You then determined that adding these equations together results in a third equation with the same solution.\n        </li>\n</ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n        2.4.2: Self Check&nbsp;\n    </li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n        2.4.3: Solving Systems of Linear Equations in Two Variables\n    </li>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\">\n            In this activity, you continued solving systems of equations in two variables by using an algebraic method of your own choice. You learned that some systems of equations are more suited to be solved by substitution and others by elimination.\n        </li>\n</ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n        2.4.3: Self Check&nbsp;&nbsp;\n    </li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n        2.4.4: Solving Systems of Equations Using Real-World Examples\n    </li>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\">\n            In this activity, you analyzed a system of equations derived from a real-world situation. You reinforced that to solve a system using elimination by adding, the coefficients of one of the variables must be the same value and have opposite signs. If this is not the case, then no variable is eliminated when the resulting equation is created.\n        </li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n        2.4.5: Practice</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In&nbsp;</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<!--Q1-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n<p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<p>Correct!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!----------------- Must be included at the bottom of page for dropdown to work ------------>\n<!--Do not edit below line.-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n</div>\n"
