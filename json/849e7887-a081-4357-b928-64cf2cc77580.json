You can then use that value to determine the value of the other variable. Ultimately, you will be able to see the relationship between the graph and solution of the system of equations.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Solve systems of equations by adding or subtracting them to eliminate a variable.</li>\n  <li>Know that adding or subtracting equations in a system creates a new equation, where one of the solutions to this equation is the solution to the system.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"body\">\n  <p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><span>2.3.1: Combining Two True Equations</span><br></li>\n    <li>2.3.2: Adding Equations</li>\n    <li>2.3.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n    <li>2.3.3: Adding and Subtracting Systems of Equations and Using Their Graphs</li>\n    <li>2.3.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n    <li>2.3.4: Determining the Best Method for Solving a System of Equations&nbsp;</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>\n  <p></p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>2.3.5: Practice</li>\n    <li>2.3.6: Lesson Summary</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p></p>\n  <p><br></p>\n</div>"
