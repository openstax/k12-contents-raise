In this lesson, they reason the other way around and think about what expressions would produce graphs with particular vertices. Students look more closely at how changing the \\(h\\) and the \\(k\\) in a quadratic expression of the form \\(a(x&minus;h)^2+k\\) translates the graph, and recall that the coefficient \\(a\\) affects the direction of the opening of a parabola.</p>\n<p>Students continue to reason abstractly with expressions and graphs, but in one of the activities they also reconnect abstract expressions and quantities to a context. They continue to consolidate the ideas, structure, and generalizations from the past few lessons and apply them in new ways.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Create a quadratic function by changing the vertex of an existing function given its equation, graph, and a description. </li>\n  <li> Describe informally (orally and in writing) the effect on the graph of a quadratic function when performing simple algebraic transformations. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li> Describe how changing a number in the vertex form of a quadratic function affects its graph. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>A7(A) <span><u>graph quadratic functions on the coordinate plane and use the graph to identify key attributes, if possible</u><u>, including</u></span><u> </u>\\(x\\)-intercept, \\(y\\)-intercept, zeros, maximum value, minimum values,<u> vertex, </u>and the equation of the axis of symmetry;</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Partial coverage: Lesson provides content that covers part of this TEKS.
