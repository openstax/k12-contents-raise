When the product is any other number, we can&rsquo;t conclude that each factor is that number.) </li>\n  <li>\"The expression \\(x^2&minus;x&minus;12\\) is equivalent to (x+3)(x&minus;4). Can we apply the zero product property to solve \\(x^2&minus;x&minus;12=0\\)?\" (Only if we rewrite the expression on the left in factored form first. We can&rsquo;t use the zero product property when the expression is not a product of factors.) </li>\n  <li>\"Can we solve \\(x^2&minus;x &minus;12=0\\) by performing the same operation to each side of the equation?\" (No, doing that doesn&rsquo;t help us isolate the variable.) </li>\n</ul>"
