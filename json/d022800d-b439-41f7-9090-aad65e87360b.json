It shows three different methods for solving an equation: by rewriting it in factored form, by transforming it into an expression in which the squared term has a coefficient 1 and then rewriting in factored form, and by completing the square. The second method involves temporarily substituting a part of the expression with another variable so that the squared term has a coefficient of 1, which makes it easier to rewrite in factored form. Students encountered this strategy in an optional activity (\"Finding the Factors of Quadratic Expressions in Standard Form (Optional)\") in an earlier lesson in Unit 8. If students did not do that optional activity, consider doing it first before using this activity.</p>\n<p>The numbers in the equations here do not lend themselves to be easily rewritten in factored form (without guessing and checking or substitution), or to be easily rewritten into perfect squares (because the leading coefficient and the constant terms are not perfect squares), but students see that these equations can be solved with these strategies. The activity further illustrates that any of these methods can be rather tedious, providing further motivation to solve using the quadratic formula, which students will learn in a future lesson.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Display the perfect squares students saw in the preceding activity. Ask them what they notice about the coefficient of the square term in each expression.</p>\n<p>\\(100x^2+80x+16\\)</p>\n<p>\\(36x^2&minus;60x+25\\)</p>\n<p>\\(25x^2+40x+16\\)</p>\n<p>\\(0.25x^2&minus;14x+196\\)</p>\n<p>Students are likely to notice that the coefficient of every \\(x^2\\) is a perfect square, which makes it easier to rewrite the completed square as squared factors. Solicit some ideas about whether we could still complete the square if a quadratic expression does not have a perfect square for the coefficient of \\(x^2\\). Then, tell students that they will explore a few methods for solving such equations.</p>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Ask one partner to study the first two methods and the other partner to study the third method, and then take turns explaining their understanding to each other. Discuss the methods, especially the third one, before students begin using them to solve equations.</p>\n<p>Make sure students see that, in both the second and third methods, the first step involves multiplying both sides of the equation by 3 to make the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) a perfect square. Each term on the left side of the equation changes by a factor of 3, but the right side of the equation remains 0 because multiplying 0 by any number results in 0.</p>\n<p>If time is limited, consider asking students to solve only three equations, using each method once.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>Here are three methods for solving \\(3x^2+8x+5=0\\).</p>\n<p>Carefully examine each
