The emphasis here is on analyzing graphs representing such situations. Students work across representations: from graphs to equations and from verbal descriptions to graphs. In addition to interpreting mathematical representations in context, students also think carefully about how the numbers used in place of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in an expression of the form \\(a \\cdot b^x\\) influence the graph of the equation \\(y=a \\cdot b^x\\) (MP7).</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Determine whether situations are characterized by exponential growth or by exponential decay given descriptions and graphs. </li>\n<li> Use graphs to compare and contrast situations that involve exponential decay. </li>\n<li> Use information from a graph to write an equation that represents exponential decay. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li> Use graphs to compare and contrast situations that involve exponential decay. </li>\n<li> Use information from a graph to write an equation that represents exponential decay. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)&nbsp;</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<colgroup>\n<col>\n<col>\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>A9(B) interpret the meaning of the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in exponential functions of the form \\(f(x) = ab^x\\) in real-world problems;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A9(C) write exponential functions in the form \\(f(x) = ab^x\\) (where \\(b\\) is a rational number) to describe problems arising from mathematical and real-world situations, including growth and decay.</p>\n<p>A9(D) graph exponential functions that model growth and decay and identify key features, including \\(y\\)-intercept and asymptote, in mathematical and real-world problems.</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4> Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 5.7.1: Patterns in Real Numbers </li>\n<li> 5.7.2: Comparing Graphs </li>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"2\"> 5.7.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li aria-level=\"2\">5.7.2: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n<li> 5.7.3: Describing Graphs&nbsp; </li>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"2\"> 5.7.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li aria-level=\"2\">5.7.3: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n<li> 5.7.4: Quantities that Change Exponentially </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 5.7.5: Practice.</p>\n<h4> Required Materials</h4>\n<p>Pre-printed slips, cut from copies of the blackline master</p>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<p>Make copies of the blackline master for the Matching Descriptions to Graphs activity, 1 copy for every 2 students.
