Here, students deepen their understanding about the merits and potential drawbacks of using the quadratic formula. They pay close attention to each step in the solving process and analyze errors commonly made when applying the formula. Students also consider how to verify that the solutions they obtained with the quadratic formula are correct.</p>\n<p>In analyzing the solution process and checking their work and the work of others, students practice attending to precision and critiquing the reasoning of others.</p>\n<p>Technology isn't required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems. Consider making technology available.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Analyze and critique (orally and in writing) solutions to quadratic equations that are found using the quadratic formula. </li>\n  <li> Determine whether a given value is a solution to a quadratic equation. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Identify common errors when using the quadratic formula. </li>\n  <li> Describe some ways to tell if a number is a solution to a quadratic equation. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>A8(A) <u>solve quadratic equations having real solutions by</u> factoring, taking square roots, completing the square, and <u>applying the quadratic formula</u>.</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Partial coverage: Lesson provides content that covers part of this TEKS.
