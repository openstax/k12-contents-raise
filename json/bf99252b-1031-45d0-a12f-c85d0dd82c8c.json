To do so, you determined the growth factor of successive bounce heights.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 5.11.2: Self Check&nbsp; </li>\n  <li> 5.11.3: (Optional) Modeling with Exponential Functions </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> In this activity, you had an opportunity to gather and analyze data for bounce heights for multiple balls. You processed your data and decided on an appropriate factor to quantify the bounciness of each ball. You became more&nbsp; comfortable with the fact that the data are not exactly exponential and with choosing different ways for deciding on an appropriate exponential decay factor. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 5.11.3: Self Check&nbsp; </li>\n  <li> 5.11.4: Examine Exponential Decay in Context </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> In this activity, you continued to examine exponential decay in the context of successive ball bounces. You used the given data to calculate a rebound factor and used it to write a function that models the relationship between number of bounces and bounce heights. You then used the function to answer questions about the ball and its bounces. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 5.11.4: Self Check&nbsp; </li>\n  <li> 5.11.5: Using Relationship Models to Answer Questions </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> In this activity, you used data to determine from what height, approximately, you thought a ball was dropped and were able to explain your reasoning.&nbsp; </li>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 5.11.6: Practice </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-content-id=\"3ffbb0b5-2ed8-4c7b-b7e7-53f96c3c6b96\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <!--pulldown-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-content-id=\"4bef46b1-649a-4717-bab8-a182f3312d1f\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n      <p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n      <p>Correct!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n      <p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!--Do not edit below line.-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n</div>"
