Students examine more situations with quantities that decrease exponentially. They work from an equation to a graph and from a graph to an equation. In both cases, they interpret the different parts of their equation in terms of the situation and use the graph to answer questions.</p>\n<p>Like many activities in this unit, the equations and graphs represent actual quantities (the area covered by algae and the amount of insulin in a person&rsquo;s body) and are to be interpreted in context. They also use a discrete graph to answer questions about quantities that vary continuously with time. In the following lessons, we will represent situations where the domain is all real numbers with a continuous graph.</p>\n<p>One activity encourages students to view a quantity that decreases by a factor of itself using multiplication rather than subtraction. If a computer costs $500 and loses \\(\\frac15\\) of its value each year, after one year we could write this, in dollars, as \\(500&minus;(\\frac{1}{5}) \\cdot 500\\). But if we write this using multiplication, as \\(500\\cdot (\\frac{4}{5})\\), then we are in a better position to see that after 2 years its value in dollars will be \\(500 \\cdot (\\frac{4}{5}) \\cdot (\\frac{4}{5})\\), and after \\(t\\) years, the value will be \\(500 \\cdot (\\frac{4}{5})^t\\). In other words, exponents are a particularly useful way to express repeated loss by a factor of the original amount. Students will carry this understanding into future lessons that deal with repeated percentage change situations.</p>\n<p>Technology isn&rsquo;t required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems. We recommend making technology available.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Comprehend that the term &ldquo;exponential growth&rdquo; describes a quantity that changes by a growth factor that is greater than 1, and the term &ldquo;exponential decay&rdquo; describes a quantity that changes by a growth factor that is less than 1 but greater than 0. </li>\n  <li> Use only multiplication to represent &ldquo;decreasing a quantity by some fraction of itself.&rdquo;</li>\n  <li> Write an expression or an equation to represent a situation where a quantity decays exponentially. </li>\n  <li> Understand that the terms &ldquo;growth factor&rdquo; and &ldquo;constant ratio&rdquo; are interchangeable. </li>\n  <li> Calculate growth factor using points on a graph that represents exponential decay. </li>\n  <li> Graph equations that represent quantities that change by a growth factor between 0 and 1. </li>\n  <li> Interpret equations and graphs that represent exponential decay situations. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)&nbsp;</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li> Use only multiplication to represent &ldquo;decreasing a quantity by a fraction of itself.&rdquo;</li>\n  <li> Write an expression or equation to represent a quantity that decays exponentially. </li>\n  <li> Know the meanings of &ldquo;exponential growth&rdquo; and &ldquo;exponential decay.&rdquo;</li>\n  <li>Explain the meanings of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in an equation that represents exponential decay and is written as \\(y=a \\cdot b^x\\).</li>\n  <li> Find a growth factor from a graph and write an equation to represent exponential decay. </li>\n  <li> Graph equations that represent quantities that change by a growth factor between 0 and 1. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>A9(B) interpret the meaning of the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in exponential functions of the form \\(f(x) = ab^x\\) in real-world problems;</p>\n        <p>A9(C) write exponential functions in the form \\(f(x) = ab^x\\) (where \\(b\\) is a rational number) to describe problems arising from mathematical and real-world situations, including growth and decay;</p>\n        <p>&nbsp;A9(D) graph exponential functions that model growth and decay and identify key features, including \\(y\\)-intercept and asymptote, in mathematical and real-world problems;</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4> Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 5.5.1: Identifying Linear and Exponential Quantities </li>\n  <li> 5.5.2: Exponential Decay&nbsp; </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> 5.5.2: Self Check&nbsp; </li>\n    <li> 5.5.2: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 5.5.3: Using Graphs to Represent Exponential Decay </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> 5.5.3: Self Check&nbsp; </li>\n    <li> 5.5.3: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 5.5.4: Justifying Exponential Models </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> 5.5.4: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 5.5.4: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 5.5.5: Writing Equations to Represent Exponential Decay&nbsp; </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 5.5.6: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<p>None</p>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<p>If possible, acquire devices that can run Desmos (recommended) or other graphing technology as an option for students to select during the lesson.</p>\n<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson.
