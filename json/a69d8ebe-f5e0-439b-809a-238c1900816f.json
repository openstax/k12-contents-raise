By grouping different parts of the polynomial together, they can find a GCF for each individual part. If the polynomial can be factored, a common factor will emerge from both parts.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Start the lesson by explaining that some polynomials will not have a common factor in all of their terms. Use the polynomial in the first example to illustrate this point, \\(ms &minus; 4m + 7s &minus; 28\\). Challenge students to find any common factor in all the terms of the polynomial.</p>\n<p>Explain that polynomials can be split into smaller parts, and we can start factoring there. Review the example step by step. Check for understanding after each step.</p>\n<p>Finally, ask students to complete questions 1&ndash;8 individually. If needed, solve the first one together as a class.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>If there is no common term in all of the terms of a polynomial, it may be possible to factor by grouping. To do this, separate the polynomial into two parts with two terms in each part. Then look for the GCF in each part. If the polynomial can be factored, you will find that a common factor emerges from both parts.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example.

They should still look for a GCF in the last two terms. It might also be possible to rearrange the terms so that the polynomial can be factored by grouping. Students should check all possibilities before determining that a polynomial is prime.</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Ask students to write down the steps used when factoring by grouping.
