Negative values of time don&rsquo;t make sense here, so the part of the graph to the left side of the vertical axis has no meaning. The object hits the ground \\(6\\) seconds after being dropped, so values greater than \\(6\\) are not meaningful. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Find the vertex and describe its meaning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> The vertex is the peak of the parabola, or the maximum, at the point \\((0,576)\\). It tells us the time when the height is the greatest. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Find the zeros and describe their meaning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> The zero of the function is \\(6\\).
