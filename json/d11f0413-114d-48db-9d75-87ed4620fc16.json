The strategies elicited here will be helpful later in the lesson when students calculate prices that involve a percent increase and write an equation to generalize the calculation.</p>\n<p>Finding different percents of the same value (200) is also an opportunity to reason repeatedly and look for and make use of structure. </p>\n<p>Students are likely to approach the problems in different ways. They may:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Convert each percentage into a fraction and multiply the fraction by 200. For example, they may think of 25% as <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( \\frac14 \\)</span>, 12% as <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( \\frac{12}{100} \\)</span> or <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( \\frac{3}{25} \\)</span>, and 8% as <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( \\frac{8}{100} \\)</span> or <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( \\frac{2}{25} \\)</span>.</li>\n<li>Convert each percentage into a decimal and multiply it by 200.</li>\n<li>Notice that 1% of 200 is 2 and that any percentage of 200 can be found by multiplying the percentage by 2. For example, 25% of 200 is <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 25 \\cdot 2 \\)</span>, and <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( p \\)</span>% of 200 is <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( p \\cdot 2 \\)</span> or <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 2p \\)</span>.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3>Launch</h3>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<p>Display one problem at a time. Give students quiet think time for each problem and ask them to give a signal when they have an answer and a strategy. Keep all problems displayed throughout the talk.
