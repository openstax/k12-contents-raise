Students pay attention to the moves that create equations with the same solution and those that don&rsquo;t. They also make sense of both the moves and the solutions in terms of the given situation. The work here gives students opportunities to reason concretely and abstractly. In an upcoming lesson, they will think about why these moves lead to equations with the same solution.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Launch</h3>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 2 and provide access to calculators. Ask students to read the opening paragraph and display the equation <span class=\"math\">\\( x - 0.1x + 2.70 = 56.70 \\)</span> for all to see. Ask students to explain how the equation represents Noah&rsquo;s purchase.</p>\n<p>Then, give students a couple of minutes to discuss the first question with their partner and ask them to pause for a whole-class discussion. Once students understand that the solution to the equation is the original price of a pair of jeans and that substituting 60 for <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( x \\)</span> makes the equation true, move on to the rest of the activity.</p>\n<p>Tell students that they will see a series of equations that are related to the original equation and that can be interpreted in terms of the situation. For each equation, their job is to determine either what move was made to the original equation, or what the equation means in context. Next, they should check if the equation has the same solution as the original. (To help students understand the task and if needed, consider working on Equation A as a class.)</p>\n<p>If time is limited, ask one partner in each group to take Equations A, C, E and the other partner to take B, D, F.</p>\n<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n<div>\n<p><em>Action and Expression: Internalize Executive Functions.</em>&nbsp;Chunk this task into more manageable parts for students who benefit from support with organizational skills in problem solving. Some students may benefit from a graphic organizer that displays and the original equation before each of the related equations. This will help focus students&rsquo; attention on the moves that may have been made.<br><em>Supports accessibility for: Organization; Attention\n      </em>\n</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>\n<div class=\"body\">\n\n<p>With a partner, discuss the following situations and their equations. When talking about each equation, you will need to discuss what the solution means in the context of the situation and if certain values are in fact solutions.</p>\n<p>Remember, if equations are equivalent and operations are applied correctly to both sides, the solution remains the same in all equivalent equations. If the operations are not applied to both sides properly, the solution would change.</p>\n<p>1. Noah is buying a pair of jeans and using a coupon for 10% off. The total price is&nbsp;$56.70, which includes&nbsp;$2.70 in sales tax. Noah&rsquo;s purchase can be modeled by the equation:</p>\n<p>\\( x - 0.1x + 2.70 = 56.70 \\)</p>\n<p><span>Discuss with a partner:</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"editor-indent\">\n<div class=\"body\"><span>a.

Sample responses:</div>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<ul>\n<li>Equation A: Every term was multiplied by 100. The equation is equivalent to Noah&rsquo;s equation. The price is now expressed in cents instead of dollars. 60 is a solution.</li>\n<li>Equation B: Subtract 2.70 from both sides of the equation. The answer is still in dollars. 60 is a solution.</li>\n<li>Equation C:&nbsp;\\( x \\) and&nbsp;\\( 0.1x \\) were correctly combined to create an equivalent equation to Noah&rsquo;s original equation. 10% off means paying 90% of the original price. 90% of the original price plus sales tax is $56.70. 60 is still a solution.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"body\">3. Sample responses</div>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<ul>\n<li>Equation D: Sales tax was not included on the left but is included on the right. This equation is not equivalent to Noah&rsquo;s original equation. The price after using the coupon for 10% off before sales tax is not the same as the price after using the coupon for 10% off including the sales tax, $56.70. 60 is not a solution.</li>\n<li>Equation E: Subtract 2.70 from the left and add 2.70 to the right. The same operation must be done to both sides of an equation to keep it balanced and to create an equivalent equation. The price after using the coupon for 10% off is not equal to 56.70 plus tax. 60 is not a solution.</li>\n<li>Equation F: The left side was multiplied by 2. Two pairs of jeans after the 10% discount and sales tax cost 56.70. 60 is not a solution.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"body\">4. Sample response: Equations A, B, C were equivalent to the original. Interpreting equations can help you understand the cost of items you buy!</div>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<ol>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<p>Display the original equation and Equations A&ndash;F for all to see. Invite students to share what was done to the original equation to get each of those equations and whether they have the same solution. Along the way, compile a list of moves that lead to equations with the same solution and those that lead to different solutions. </p>\n<p>Ask students to observe the list and see what kinds of moves produce Equations A&ndash;C and D&ndash;F. Record the moves that create equations with the same solutions, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adding or multiplying both sides of the equal sign by the same number.</li>\n<li>applying properties of operations (commutative, associative, or distributive).</li>\n<li>combining like terms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also record the moves that create equations with different solutions, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adding or multiplying a different number to the two sides, or performing an operation to only one side.</li>\n<li>adding different expressions to the two sides.</li>\n<li>performing different operations on each side.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(The lists don&rsquo;t need to be comprehensive because students will examine these moves more closely later.)</p>\n<p>Next, give students a couple of examples of how the equations and their solutions could be interpreted in context. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Equation A shows the cost calculation in cents, so the original price of a pair of jeans is unchanged.</li>\n<li>Equation D shows the discounted price, excluding tax, to be <span>$</span>56.70, but in the original equation, the price <span>$</span>56.70 included tax. This means that, in Equation D, the original price of one pair of jeans is different from the first equation. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Prompt students to interpret 1&ndash;2 other equations and to explain why the solution in each equation (or the price of one pair of jeans) is equal or unequal to that in the initial equation. Here are possible interpretations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Equation B shows the discounted price before sales tax to be <span>$</span>54, which is <span>$</span>2.70 less than <span>$</span>56.70. This is also the case in the initial equation, so the original price of the jeans is still the same. </li>\n<li>Equation C shows the discounted price as 90% of the original price, which is the same as 10% less than the original price (100%). The original price is unchanged.</li>\n<li>Equation E shows the discounted price, before tax, to be <span>$</span>59.40. This is more than the pre-tax price in the initial equation, so the original price of the jeans here must be higher.</li>\n<li>Equation F shows the price of 2 pairs of jeans, including the discount and tax, to be <span>$</span>56.70. This means the price of a pair of jeans must be much less than in the initial equation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.6.3: Self Check&nbsp;</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"body\"><strong><em>Following the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong><br></div><br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>QUESTION:</strong><br>Which of the following is a correct next step to create an equation equivalent to \\( x - 0.2x - 4.2 =13.4 \\)?<br></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Answers</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Feedback</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\\( 0.8x - 4.2 = 13.4 \\)</td>\n<td>That&rsquo;s correct!
