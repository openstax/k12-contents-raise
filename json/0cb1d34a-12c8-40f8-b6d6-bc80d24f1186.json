It also reminds students that an equation is a statement that two expressions are equal and that different expressions could be used to represent a quantity. Later in this lesson and throughout the unit, students will create, interpret, and reason about equations with letters representing quantities.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Launch</h3>\n<div class=\"body\">\n  <p>Arrange students in groups of 2. For the last question, ask each partner to come up with a new equation.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>\n<p>Here are some letters and what they represent. All costs are in dollars.</p>\n<ul>\n  <ul>\n    <li><span>\\( m \\) represents the cost of a main dish.</span></li>\n    <li><span>\\( n \\) represents the number of side dishes.</span></li>\n    <li><span>\\( s \\) represents the cost of a side dish.</span></li>\n    <li><span>\\( t \\) represents the total cost of a meal.</span></li>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li><span>Discuss with a partner: What does each equation mean in this situation?</span>\n    <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n      <li><span>\\( m=7.50 \\)</span></li>\n      <li>\\( m = s + 4.50 \\)</li>\n      <li>\\( ns = 6 \\)</li>\n      <li>\\( m + ns = t \\)<br><br></li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li><span>Write a new equation that could be true in this situation.</span><br></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Student Response</h3>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>For example:<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n      <li>A main dish costs&nbsp;<span>$</span>7.50.</li>\n      <li>A main dish costs&nbsp;<span>$</span>4.50 more than a side dish.</li>\n      <li>Ordering&nbsp;<span>\\( n \\)</span>&nbsp;side dishes at&nbsp;<span>\\( s \\)</span>&nbsp;dollars each costs&nbsp;<span>$</span>6.00.</li>\n      <li>The total cost of the meal is the cost of a main dish plus the cost of&nbsp;<span>\\( n \\)</span>&nbsp;side dishes at&nbsp;<span>\\( s \\)</span>&nbsp;dollars.</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li>Sample responses:<ul>\n      <li><span>\\( n = 2 \\)</span></li>\n      <li><span>\\( m - s=4.5 \\)</span></li>\n      <li><span>\\( m + 6 = 13.5 \\)</span></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>\n<div class=\"body\">\n  <p>Invite students to share their interpretations of the given equations and the new equations they wrote. Then, discuss with students:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>&ldquo;What is an equation? What does it tell us?&rdquo; (An equation is a statement that an expression has the same value as another expression.)</li>\n    <li>&ldquo;Can equations contain only numbers?&rdquo; (Yes.) &ldquo;Only letters?&rdquo; (Yes.) &ldquo;A mix of numbers and letters?&rdquo; (Yes.)</li>\n    <li>&ldquo;The last question asked you to write an equation that could be true. Could this equation be true:&nbsp;<span>\\( m + 5 = t \\)</span>? How do you know?&rdquo; (It could be. If&nbsp;<span>\\( m \\)</span>&nbsp;is 7.50 and&nbsp;<span>\\( t \\)</span>&nbsp;is 12.50, then the equation is true.)</li>\n    <li>&ldquo;When might the equation be false?&rdquo; (If&nbsp;<span>\\( m \\)</span>&nbsp;is 7.50 and&nbsp;<span>\\( t \\)</span>&nbsp;is anything but 12.50, or if the value of&nbsp;<span>\\( t \\)</span>&nbsp;is not 5 more than&nbsp;<span>\\( m \\)</span>, then it is false.)</li>\n    <li>&ldquo;One equation tells us that a main dish is&nbsp;<span>$</span>7.50. Another equation tells us that it is equal to the expression&nbsp;<span>\\( s + 4.50 \\)</span>. Could both be true? Are they both appropriate for expressing the cost of a main dish?&rdquo; (Yes. The first one tells us the price in dollars. The second tells us how the price compares to a side dish.)</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>"
