Students are prompted to write an equation but are not expected to solve it at this point.</p>\n<p>The prompt to write an equation is left relatively open to allow for different approaches. For instance, students may think in terms of:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> The length and width of the framed picture. The length is 7 inches plus the width of the frame, \\(x\\), on either side, which gives \\(7 + 2x\\). The height is 4 inches plus the same frame width, \\(x\\), for the top and bottom, which gives \\(4 + 2x\\). The total area is \\(7 \\cdot 4 + 4 \\cdot (2.5)\\), or 38 square inches, so the equation is \\((7 + 2x)(4 + 2x) = 38\\). </li>\n  <li> The area of the picture plus the area of the frame. The area of the picture is 28 square inches. The area of the frame, in square inches, can be found by decomposing it into </li>\n  <ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n    <li> four squares (in the corners) that are \\(x\\) by \\(x\\), or \\(x^2\\) each </li>\n    <li> two rectangles that are \\(7x\\) each (top and bottom) </li>\n    <li> two rectangles that are \\(4x\\) each (left and right). </li>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n<p>The equation is \\(4x^2+2(7x)+2(4x)+28=38\\) or \\(4x^2+22x+28=38\\).</p>\n<p>As students work, monitor for different strategies students use. Invite students with contrasting approaches to share later.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Tell students that they will now write an equation to represent the quantities in the framing problem. Consider arranging students in groups of two and asking them to think quietly about the questions before conferring with their partner.</p>\n<p>If students have trouble getting started, suggest that they start by labeling the diagram with relevant lengths. Then, if needed, use scaffolding questions such as:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> \"How do you determine the area of a picture that is 7 inches by 4 inches?\" (Multiply \\(7 \\cdot 4 = 28\\).) </li>\n  <li>\"What is the combined area of the picture and the framing material?\" (38 square inches, because \\(7 \\cdot 4 + 4 \\cdot (2.5) = 38\\).) </li>\n  <li> \"What happens to the dimensions of a picture if a frame is added around the outside of the picture?\" (It increases.) </li>\n  <ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n    <li> \"How is the width changed?\" (It will be increased by two times the width of the frame.) </li>\n    <li> \"How is the length changed?\" (It will be increased by two times the width of the frame.) </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li>\"How could we show that the frame is the same width all the way around?\" (Use the same variable, for example, \\(x\\), to label the width of the strip of framing on all four sides.) </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>Here is a diagram that shows the picture with a frame that is the same width all the way around.</p>\n<p>The picture is 7 inches by 4 inches. The frame is created from 10 square inches of framing material (in the form of a rectangle measuring 4 inches by 2.5 inches).</p>\n<p><img height=\"248\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/fd5cda0457be859308277a5482498d7016413a1b\" width=\"417\"></p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>Write an expression to represent the length of the framed picture on its shorter side. Use \\(x\\) to represent the width of the frame.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> \\(2x + 4\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n  <li>Write an expression to represent the length of the framed picture on its longer side. Use \\(x\\) to represent the width of the frame.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> \\(2x + 7\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\">\n  <li>Use the expressions from the previous exercises to write an equation to represent the relationship between the measurements of the framed picture and its total area. Be prepared to explain what each part of your equation represents.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> \\((2x + 7)(2x + 4) = 38\\) or \\(4x^2 + 22x + 28 = 38\\) (or equivalent)</p>\n<p><img alt=\"A picture is shown with a frame of uniform width around it.

Consider drawing a segment composed of 3 pieces of length 1.5 inches, 10 inches, and 1.5 inches, and prompting students to find the length of the entire segment. Then, change each 1.5 to an \\(x\\) and ask for an expression for the length of the entire segment \\((10 + 2x)\\).</p>\n<p>If students mistake the result of adding \\(x\\) and \\(x\\) as \\(x^2\\), consider drawing a square with side length \\(x\\) and ask students to write expressions for the perimeter and area. Then, ask them to point out the difference between multiplying to find area and adding to find total length. If needed, draw a few more segments that are decomposed into parts, with each part labeled with a number or a variable expression, and ask students to write expressions for the total length.</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Select students to present their equations and reasoning. If no students bring up one of the strategies shown in the Activity Narrative, bring it up. Consider asking students whether \\((7 + 2x)(4 + 2x) = 38\\) and \\(4x^2 + 22x + 28 = 38\\) (or other correct equations that come up) are equivalent and how to check if they are.</p>\n<p>Discuss what a solution to these equations represents. Make sure students understand that a solution reveals the width of the frame when all of the framing material (10 square inches) is used.</p>\n<p>Solicit some ideas on how they might go about finding the solution(s). Students may mention:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Graphing the equation \\(y = (7 + 2x)(4 + 2x)\\) and finding a point on the graph with a \\(y\\)-coordinate of 38 </li>\n  <li> Evaluating the expression on one side of the equation at different values of \\(x\\) until it has a value of 38 </li>\n  <li> Using a spreadsheet to evaluate the expression at different values of \\(x\\) and see what values produce an output of 38 </li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can see that the equations \\((7 + 2x)(4 + 2x) = 38\\) and \\(4x^2 + 22x + 28 = 38\\) are each composed of a quadratic expression. Tell students that these are examples of quadratic equations.</p>\n<p>A quadratic equation is defined as one that can be written in the form of \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), where \\(a\\) is not 0.</p>\n<p>They will learn several techniques for using algebra to solve equations like this. In the next lesson, students will work with equations of this form and make sense of them in context.</p>\n<h4>Video: Formulating a Quadratic Equation to Represent the Model</h4>\n<p>Watch the following video to learn more about formulating a quadratic equation to represent the model.</p>\n<video controls=\"true\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" width=\"550\">\n  <source src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/3da5ec1aa9c1847437a0eb534316e26a796642e9\">\n  <track default=\"true\" kind=\"captions\" label=\"On\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c7c85fd780762a181ac98e0c385b3f823cccbe39\" srclang=\"en_us\">https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/3da5ec1aa9c1847437a0eb534316e26a796642e9\n</video>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h3>8.1.3: Self Check</h3>\n<em><strong>\n    <p>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</p>\n  </strong></em> <br>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"304\">\n    <col width=\"324\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>\n        <p>Suppose a different picture is 5 inches by 5 inches.
