To explain what the letters in the inequalities mean in the given context, students cannot simply match the numbers in the verbal descriptions and those in the inequalities. They must attend carefully to the symbols and any operations and reason both quantitatively and abstractly.<br></p>\n<p>The work here also engages students in an aspect of mathematical modeling. Although students do not choose the variables to represent the essential features of a situation, they think carefully about and explain how the given models do represent the key features of the given situation.</p>\n<p>As students discuss with their partners, listen for those who could interpret the inequalities clearly and accurately. Ask them to share their interpretations later.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Give them a few minutes of quiet think time, followed by some time to share their thinking with their partner.<br></p>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>\n<p>Seniors in a high school student council are trying to develop a budget for the Senior Dance. The revenue from ticket sales needs to cover the cost of the meals and entertainment and also make a profit of at least $200 to be contributed to the school.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here is some information they have gathered:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Last year, 120 people attended. It was a success and is expected to be even bigger this year. Up to 200 people will attend.</li>\n<li>There needs to be at least 1 chaperone for every 20 students.</li>\n<li>The ticket price cannot exceed $20 per person.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Here are some inequalities the seniors wrote about the situation. Each letter stands for one quantity in the situation. Determine what is meant by each letter.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\\( t &le; 20 \\)</li>\n<li>\\( 120 &le; p &le; 200 \\)</li>\n<li>\\( pt &minus; m &ge; 200 \\)</li>\n<li>\\( c \\geq \\frac{p}{20} \\)</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n\n<p>Sample response (an interpretation of the meaning of each letter and an interpretation of the mathematical statement are included):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\\( t &le; 20 \\) means that the ticket price, \\( t \\), must be less than or equal to $20.</li>\n<li>\\( 120 &le; p &le; 200 \\) means that between 120 and 200 people are expected to attend (120 is less than or equal to the number of people; the number of people is less than or equal to 200). \\( p \\) represents the number of people attending the dance.</li>\n<li>\\( pt &minus; m &ge; 200 \\) means that the total amount collected from ticket sales in dollars, \\( pt \\), minus the cost of meals and entertainment in dollars, \\( m \\), must be greater than or equal to $200.</li>\n<li>\\( c \\geq \\frac{p}{20} \\) means that the number of chaperones, \\( c \\), must be at least \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\) of the number of students attending.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4>Student-Facing Extension</h4>\n<h5>Are you ready for more?</h5>\n<p>Kiran says we should add the constraint \\( t &ge; 0 \\).</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What is the reasoning behind this constraint?</li>\n<li>What other &ldquo;natural constraint&rdquo; like this should be added?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>\n<p>Some students may relate an inequality to a written description simply based on the letter chosen for the variable (for example, &ldquo;people&rdquo; begins with &ldquo;p&rdquo;). Push these students to explain how the inequalities express the quantities and constraints in the written descriptions.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For students unfamiliar with the notation \\( 120&le;p&le;200 \\), explain that this is a way of stating \\( 120&le;p \\) and \\( p&le;200 \\).</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>Invite previously identified students to share their responses. Make sure students understand why the symbols accurately represent the constraints in the situation.</p>\n<p>For the last two inequalities, make sure students see how the operations represent the constraints on profit and on the number of chaperones.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;If needed, use numbers to illustrate the relationship between variables. For example, to help students make sense of \\( c \\geq \\frac{p}{20} \\), ask: &ldquo;How many chaperones are needed if there are 120 students?&rdquo; (at least \\( \\frac{120}{20} \\) or 6 chaperones, or \\( c \\geq \\frac{120}{20} \\)) &ldquo;180 students?&rdquo; (at least \\( \\frac{180}{20} \\) or 9 chaperones, or \\( c \\geq \\frac{180}{20} \\))</p>\n<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>\n\n<div>\n<p>Use this routine to support reading comprehension of this problem. Use the first read to orient students to the situation. Ask students to describe what the situation is about without using numbers (students planning a budget for an upcoming special event). Take time to discuss the meaning of unfamiliar terms at this time (<em>Senior Dance</em>, <em>budget</em>, <em>chaperone</em>, <em>profit</em>, etc.). Use the second read to identify quantities and relationships. Ask students what can be counted or measured without focusing on the values (number of people who attended in the past, maximum number of people expected this year, ratio of chaperones to students, maximum ticket price, minimum amount of profit needed, etc.). After the third read, ask students to brainstorm possible strategies to answer the questions. This will help students make sense of language used to describe situations involving inequalities.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n\n<div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Representation: Internalize Comprehension. </em>Provide appropriate reading accommodations and supports to ensure student access to written directions, word problems, and other text-based content.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Supports accessibility for:</em> Language; Conceptual processing</p>\n</div>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3><span>2.7.2: Self Check</span></h3>\n<p><span><strong><em>Following the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></span><br></p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"302\">\n<col width=\"322\">\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>QUESTION:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A zookeeper feeds the tigers a meal of rabbits and chickens.
