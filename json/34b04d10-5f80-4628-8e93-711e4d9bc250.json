Students are given a system that represents the quantities and constraints in a situation. They interpret, in context, the solutions to the individual equations and to the system. They then use the context to make sense of the sum of the two equations and why it shares a solution with the equations in the given system. Along the way, students begin to formulate a logical explanation as to why adding (or subtracting) the two equations in a system can be helpful for identifying the solution to the system.</p>\n<p>Students also practice solving systems by adding and subtracting equations and checking their solutions. They also encounter systems where one variable cannot be easily eliminated (given what they know at this point), motivating the need for another strategy.</p>\n<h3>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h3>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explain (orally and in writing) why adding or subtracting two equations that share a solution results in a new equation that also shares the same solution.</li>\n<li>Practice solving systems of linear equations by adding or subtracting equations to eliminate a variable.</li>\n<li>Use context to make sense of an equation that is the sum of two equations in a system and to reason about why this equation shares a solution with the system.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Explain why adding or subtracting two equations that share a solution results in a new equation that also shares the same solution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h3>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>TEKS</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A.5(C) solve systems of two linear equations with two variables for mathematical and real-world problems.<br></td>\n<td>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<h3>Lesson Activities</h3>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2.4.1: Writing and Evaluating New Equations</li>\n<li>2.4.2: Adding Two Equations in a System<ul>\n<li>2.4.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li>2.4.2: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>2.4.3: Solving Systems of Linear Equations in Two Variables<ul>\n<li>2.4.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li>2.4.3: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>2.4.4: Solving Systems of Equations Using Real-World Examples&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div><span>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 2.4.5: Practice.</span></div>\n<div><br>\n<h3>Required Materials</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Graphing Technology</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Required Preparation</h3>\n<p>Acquire devices that can run Desmos (recommended) or other graphing technology.
