The thinking involved here prepares students to reason about other patterns that illustrate quadratic relationships.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Give students 2&ndash;3 minutes of quiet think time, and then ask them to share their thinking with their partner.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>How does each expression represent the number of small squares in the figure?</p>\n<p><img alt=\"An image of a block of squares.

If time permits, ask students if they could generate a different expression that also represents the number of squares in the figure.</p>"
