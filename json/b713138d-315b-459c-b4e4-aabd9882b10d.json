Some equations can be solved by rewriting them as a factored expression equal to 0, while some must be solved by completing the square or using the quadratic formula. </li>\n<li> Rewriting the given expression in a different form: for example, rewriting it in vertex form to find the maximum value of the function. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>If any students take a graphing approach and finish quickly, challenge them to verify their solution to each problem by using a second method that does not rely on graphing.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Ask students to read the task quietly and sketch a rough graph showing the diver's height as a function of time. When a diver jumps off a board, her height increases for a short time and then decreases until the time at which she enters the water, or the time at which her height above the water is 0 meters.</p>\n<p>Display one of these sketches for all to see and ask what information might be added to the graph that we know so far. Generally, we want to make sure students understand that the values along the horizontal axis correspond to the number of seconds after the jump, and values along the vertical axis correspond to the height in meters of the diver above the water.</p>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement </h4>\n<p>The function \\(h\\), defined by \\(h(t)=-5t^2+10t+7.5\\), models the height of a diver above the water (in meters) \\(t\\) seconds after the diver leaves the board. For each question, explain your reasoning.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n<li>How high above the water is the diving board?<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>When does the diver hit the water?<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>At what point during her descent toward the water is the diver at the same height as the diving board?<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>When does the diver reach the maximum height of the dive?<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>What is the maximum height the diver reaches during the dive?</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n<li>7.5 meters</li>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n<li>About 2.58 seconds after leaving the board. The height of the diver when hitting the water is 0 meters, so we can solve \\(-5t^2+10t+7.5=0\\). Using the quadratic formula, we get:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\(t\\;=\\;\\frac{-b\\;\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-\\;4ac}}{2a}\\\\t\\;=\\;\\frac{-10\\;\\pm\\sqrt{10^2-\\;4(-5)(7.5)}}{2(-5)}\\\\t\\;=\\;\\frac{-10\\;\\pm\\sqrt{100+150}}{-10}\\\\t\\;=\\;\\frac{-10\\;\\pm\\sqrt{250}}{-10}\\\\t\\;=\\;1\\pm\\;\\frac{\\sqrt{250}}{-10}\\)</p>\n<p>\\(\\sqrt{250}\\) is about 15.8, so the solutions are approximately \\(1\\pm\\frac{15.8}{-10}\\), which are about -0.58 and 2.58.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\">\n<li>2 seconds after leaving the board. The diving board is 7.5 meters above the ground, so we can solve \\(-5t^2+10t+7.5=7.5\\), which is equivalent to \\(-5t^2+10t=0\\), or \\(-5t(t&minus;2)=0\\). The solutions are \\(t=0\\) or \\(t=2\\). When \\(t=0\\), the diver is still on the board. When \\(t=2\\), the diver has gone up and is on the way down.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"4\">\n<li>1 second after leaving the board. The maximum height corresponds to the vertex of the graph representing the function, so the maximum height occurs halfway between -0.58 and 2.58, or halfway between 0 and 2.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"5\">\n<li>12.5 meters.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> Substituting 1 into the expression \\(-5t^2+10t+7.5\\) gives \\(-5(1)^2+10(1)+7.5\\), or \\(-5+10+7.5\\), which is 12.5. </li>\n<li> Rewriting the expression \\(-5t^2+10t+7.5\\) in vertex form gives \\(-5(t&minus;1)^2+12.5\\), which tells us that the vertex of the graph is at \\((1,12.5)\\). </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>\n<p>If students have trouble getting started, tell them that sometimes it is helpful to restate a question to make it about the function or its graph. For example, \"When does the diver hit the water?\" can be restated as \"At what time is the diver 0 meters above the water?\" or \"What is the positive horizontal intercept of a graph representing the function?\" Ask students to think about how they might restate some questions about the situation as questions about the function or its graph and write these down or share them with a partner before they get to work.</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Display the graph for all to see and ask students to interpret the graph: which numbers answer which questions? Once this is settled, invite students to share other approaches to solving the problems besides interpreting coordinates on the graph.</p>\n<p><img height=\"230\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/im-ims-export/o47QNH81AsW94mxhUbhphgwK\" width=\"307\"></p>"
