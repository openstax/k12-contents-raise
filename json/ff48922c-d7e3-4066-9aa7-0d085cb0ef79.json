Calculate the vertex by finding the \\(x\\)-coordinate in between \\(x = -5\\) and \\(x = 0\\) which is \\(x = -2.5\\). Substitute \\(x=-2.5\\) into the equation to find the \\(y\\)-coordinate: \\(y=(-2.5)2+5(-2.5)=-6.188\\). The vertex is at \\((-2.5, -6.188)\\). The squared term has a positive coefficient so the graph opens upward. Adding a positive linear term to \\(x^2\\) shifts the graph down and to the left.</p>\n<p><img alt='\"Graph of 2 parabolas &amp;nbsp;\" height=\"200\"' height=\"267\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/a42561305274a589ef2901336af6782c1d5656fc\" width=\"424\"></p>\n<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>\n<h5>More Chances</h5>\n<p>This lesson goes beyond the depth of understanding required to address the standards, so there is not a need to slow down if students struggle with these ideas.</p>"
