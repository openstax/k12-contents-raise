The work of this lesson connects to previous work because students investigated patterns of association in bivariate data in eighth grade and in a previous lesson. The work of this lesson connects to upcoming work because students will use technology to fit a line of best fit to data and will formally assess the strength of a linear relationship.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When students articulate things they notice and things they wonder about a scatter plot and the accompanying linear model, students have an opportunity to attend to precision in the language they use to describe what they see. Students reason abstractly by making sense of slope and intercept in context.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the activities in this lesson works best when each student has access to devices that can run Desmos because students benefit from estimating the line of best fit in a dynamic way.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Students will be able to:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Fit a linear model to a scatter plot of data and informally judge its goodness of fit.</li>\n  <li>Interpret (orally and in writing) the rate of change and vertical intercept for a linear model in everyday language.</li>\n  <li>Predict (extrapolate) and estimate (interpolate) values not given in the data set by using an equation representing the linear model.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Describe the rate of change and \\(y\\)-intercept for a linear model in everyday language.</li>\n  <li>Draw a linear model that fits the data well and use the linear model to estimate values.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<div align=\"left\" dir=\"ltr\">\n  <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n    <colgroup>\n      <col>\n      <col>\n    </colgroup>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\">TEKS</p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\">Explanation of Coverage</p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\">4(C) write, with and without technology, linear functions that provide a reasonable fit to data to estimate solutions and make predictions for real-world problems.</p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\">Foundational: Lesson provides foundational content necessary for students to be able to perform this TEKS in later lessons.</p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</div><strong></strong><br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>3.1.0: Lesson Overview</li>\n  <li>3.1.1: Exploring Scatter Plots</li>\n  <li>3.1.2: Creating a Scatter Plot Using Data<ul>\n      <li>3.1.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n      <li>3.1.2: Additional Resources&nbsp;</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>3.1.3: Interpreting the Slope and Vertical Intercept of a Linear Model<ul>\n      <li>3.1.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n      <li>3.1.3: Additional Resources&nbsp;</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>3.1.4: Interpreting the Slope and Vertical Intercept of a Scatter Plot<ul>\n      <li>3.1.4: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n      <li>3.1.4: Additional Resources&nbsp;</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>3.1.5: Using an Equation for a Fit Line&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 3.1.6: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Graphing technology</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<p>Devices are required to view the video for &ldquo;3.1.2: Creating a Scatter Plot Using Data.&rdquo;</p>\n<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson.
