The work prompts them to think about a pair of values that simultaneously meets multiple constraints in the situation, which in turn helps them make sense of the phrase &ldquo;a solution to both equations.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Monitor for these likely strategies for completing the tables, from less precise to more precise:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Guessing and checking</li>\n  <li>Using the graph (by identifying the point with a given \\( x \\)- or \\( y \\)-value and estimating the unknown value, or using technology to get an estimate)</li>\n  <li>Substituting the given value of one variable into the equation and solving for the other variable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Identify students who use each strategy and ask them to share later.</p>\n<h3>Launch</h3>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 2 and provide access to graphing technology. Explain to students that they will now examine the same situation involving two quantities (raisins and walnuts), but there are now two constraints (cost and weight).</p>\n<p>Give students 3&ndash;4 minutes of quiet time to complete the first set of questions about the cost constraint, and then pause for a whole-class discussion. Select previously identified students to share their strategies, in the order listed in the Activity Narrative. If one of the strategies is not mentioned, bring it up. </p>\n<p>Ask a student who used the graph to complete the table to explain how exactly they used the graph. For example: &ldquo;How did you use the graph of \\( 4x+8y=15 \\) to find \\( y \\) when \\( x \\) is 2?&rdquo; Make sure students recognize that this typically involves hovering over different points on the graph or tracing the graph to get the coordinates. </p>\n<p>Ask students to proceed with the remainder of the activity. If time permits, pause again after the second set of questions (about the weight constraint) to discuss how the strategies for completing the second table are like or unlike those for completing the first table. Alternatively, give students a minute to confer with their partner before moving on to the last question.</p>\n<h4>Support for Students with Disabilities</h4>\n<div>\n  <p><em>Representation: Internalize Comprehension. </em>Provide appropriate reading accommodations and supports to ensure student access to written directions, word problems, and other text-based content.</p>\n  <p><em>Supports accessibility for: Language; Conceptual processing</em></p>\n</div>\n<h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>Here is a situation you saw earlier: Diego bought some raisins and walnuts to make trail mix.

If students struggle to answer the last question, ask them to study the values in the table. Ask questions such as: &ldquo;If Diego bought 0.25 pound of raisins, would he meet both the cost and weight requirements?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Which combinations of raisins and walnuts would allow him to meet both requirements? How many combinations are there?&rdquo;</p>\n<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>\n<p>Invite students to share their response and reasoning for the last question. Display the graphs representing the system (either created by a student or as shown in the Student Response). Discuss with students:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>&ldquo;Can you find other combinations of raisins and walnuts, besides 0.25 pound and 1.75 pounds, that meet both cost and weight constraints?&rdquo; (No)</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;How many possible combinations of raisins and walnuts meet both constraints? How do we know?&rdquo; (One combination, because the graphs intersect only at one point.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Explain to students that the two equations written to represent the constraints form a<em> </em><strong>system of equations</strong>. We use a curly bracket to indicate a system, like this: </p>\n<p>\\( \\begin{cases}\\begin {align} 4x + 8y &amp;= 15\\\\ x+ \\hspace{2mm}y&amp;=2 \\end{align} \\end{cases} \\)</p>\n<p>Highlight that the <span>solution to the system</span> is a pair of values (in this case, pounds of raisins and walnuts) that meet both constraints. This means the pair of values is a solution to both equations. Graphing is an effective way to see the solution to both equations, if one exists.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>2.1.2: Self Check</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Following the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</strong></em><br></p><span>\n  <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n    <colgroup>\n      <col width=\"302\">\n      <col width=\"322\">\n    </colgroup>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td colspan=\"2\">\n          <p dir=\"ltr\"><span><strong>QUESTION</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A school group bought 12 tickets to visit a history museum.&nbsp;</span></p>\n          <ul>\n            <li><span>Adult tickets are $5 each.</span></li>\n            <li><span>Student tickets are $8 each.</span></li>\n          </ul>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The school paid a total of $90.

The equation 2 x minus y equals minus 5 becomes 2 times minus 4 minus open parentheses minus 3 close parentheses equal to or not equal to minus 5. Simplifying, we get minus 5 equals minus 5, which is correct. The ordered pair minus 4, minus 3 does make both equations true. Hence, it is a solution.\" class=\"img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/07834f9e3c9941aa3556e950b5eceec9f2785bee\" width=\"300\">\n<div align=\"left\" dir=\"ltr\"></div>\n<h3>Try It: Solve Systems of Linear Equations</h3>\n<div align=\"left\" dir=\"ltr\">\n  <br>\n  <p>Determine whether the ordered pair is a solution to the system</p>\n  <p>\\(\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}3x\\;+\\;y\\;=\\;0\\\\x\\;+\\;2y\\;=\\;-5\\end{array}\\right.\\)</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\\((1, -3)\\)</li>\n    <li>\\((0, 0)\\)</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n<h3>Solution</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here is how to determine whether the ordered pair is a solution to the system:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">\\((1, -3)\\) does make both equations true. \\((1, -3)\\) is a solution.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<div align=\"left\" dir=\"ltr\">\n  <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n    <colgroup>\n      <col>\n      <col>\n    </colgroup>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\\(3(1) + -3 = 0\\)</span></p>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\\(3 - 3 = 0\\)</span></p>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \\(0 = 0\\)</span></p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \\(1 + 2(-3) = -5\\)</span></p>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\\(1 - 6 = -5\\)</span></p>\n          <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \\( -5 = -5\\)</span></p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</div><br>\n<ul>\n  <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">\\((0, 0)\\) doesn&rsquo;t make both equations true. \\((0, 0)\\) is not a solution.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span>\\(3(0) + 0 = 0\\)</span></p>\n        <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \\(0 + 0 = 0\\)</span></p>\n        <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \\(0 = 0\\)</span></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \\(0 + 2(0) = -5\\)</span></p>\n        <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\\(0 + 0 = -5\\)</span></p>\n        <p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\\(0 &ne; -5\\)</span></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<div align=\"left\" dir=\"ltr\"><span><br></span></div>\n<div align=\"left\" dir=\"ltr\"></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How did you do?
