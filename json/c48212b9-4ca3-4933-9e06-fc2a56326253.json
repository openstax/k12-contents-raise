Being able to recognize detailed aspects of these expressions helps provide a better understanding that is useful when solving by factoring. </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 8.10.2: Working with Quadratic Factored Form with Leading Coefficient Other Than One </li>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> In this activity, you learned the process that is involved when attempting to factor a quadratic expression where the leading coefficient is not 1. By using a guess and check method, you were able to solve these expressions. </li>\n<li> 8.10.2: Self Check </li>\n<li> 8.10.2: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 8.10.3: Using Technology to Find Rational Factors </li>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> In this activity, you applied graphing technology to solve complicated quadratic functions that were not factorable by other means, since the zeros were non-integer rational numbers. </li>\n<li> 8.10.3: Self Check </li>\n<li> 8.10.3: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 8.10.4: Finding the Factors of Quadratic Expressions in Standard Form </li>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> In this optional activity, you learned two different methods to factor complicated quadratic equations with leading coefficients greater than 1. You learned to use one method when the leading coefficient was a perfect square and another method when it was not a perfect square. </li>\n<li> 8.10.4: Self Check </li>\n<li> 8.10.4: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 8.10.5: Solving Quadratic Equations by Any Method </li>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> In this activity, you combined all of the skills you learned in the lesson to factor quadratic equations using any method you preferred. </li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> 8.10.6: Practice </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<!--pulldown-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n<p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<p>Correct!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!--Do not edit below line.-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n</div>"
