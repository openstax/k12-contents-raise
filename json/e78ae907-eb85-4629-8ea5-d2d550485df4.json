In this lesson, they build on that understanding and construct quadratic functions to represent projectile motions. Along the way, they learn about the zeros of a function and the vertex of a graph. They also begin to consider appropriate domains for a function, given the situation it represents.</p>\n<p>Students use a linear model to describe the height of an object that is launched directly upward at a constant speed. Because of the influence of gravity, however, the object will not continue to travel at a constant rate. Eventually it will stop going higher and will start falling, so the model will have to be adjusted. They notice that this phenomenon can be represented with a quadratic function and that adding a squared term to the linear term seems to &ldquo;bend&rdquo; the graph and change its direction.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Create graphs of quadratic functions that represent a physical phenomenon and determine an appropriate domain when graphing. </li>\n  <li> Identify and interpret (orally and in writing) the meaning of the vertex of a graph and the zeros of a function represented in tables and graphs. </li>\n  <li> Write and interpret (orally and in writing) quadratic functions that represent a physical phenomenon. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li> Create quadratic functions and graphs that represent a situation. </li>\n  <li> Relate the vertex of a graph and the zeros of a function to a situation. </li>\n  <li> Know that the domain of a function can depend on the situation it represents. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>A7(A) graph quadratic functions on the coordinate plane and use the graph to identify key attributes, if possible, including \\(x\\)-intercept, \\(y\\)intercept, zeros, maximum value, minimum values, vertex, and the equation of the axis of symmetry.</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Foundational: Lesson provides foundational content necessary for students to be able to perform this TEKS in later lessons.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 7.6.1: Using Linear Functions to Describe Constant Speed </li>\n  <li> 7.6.2: The Force of Gravity Change in Quadratic Functions </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li aria-level=\"2\"> 7.6.2: Self Check </li>\n    <li aria-level=\"2\"> 7.6.2: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 7.6.3: Using Quadratic Functions to Describe Height </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li aria-level=\"2\"> 7.6.3: Self Check </li>\n    <li aria-level=\"2\"> 7.6.3: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 7.6.4: Interpreting Graphs of Quadratic Functions </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 7.6.5: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li> Graphing technology </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<p>Acquire devices that can run Desmos (recommended) or other graphing technology.
