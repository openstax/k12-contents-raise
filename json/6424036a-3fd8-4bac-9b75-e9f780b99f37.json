The \\(y\\)-intercept is (0,8).\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n  <li>Where do you see the &ndash;2 from the equation in the graph?<br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> The &ndash;2 is the slope of the line. You can see it, for example, by looking at \\((0,8)\\) and \\((1,6)\\). When \\(x\\) increases by 1, \\(y\\) decreases by 2.\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n  <li>What is the value of \\(x\\) for the \\(x\\)-intercept of the graph? How does this relate to the equation?<br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> The x-intercept is \\((4, 0)\\) so the x-value is 4. When 4 is substituted for the value of \\(x\\) in the equation, the result is 0. In other words, this is when \\(y\\) = 0. Thus, it is location where the graph of the equation crosses the x-axis and where the value of the equation equals 0. \n  </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Make sure students recall that:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> The \\(y\\)-intercept tells us where a graph intersects the \\(y\\)-axis, at which point the \\(x\\) value is 0. When a linear equation is written in the form \\(y=mx+b\\), the \\(b\\) tells us the \\(y\\)-intercept because when \\(x\\) is 0, \\(mx\\) is also 0, so \\(y=b\\) and \\((0,b)\\) is the \\(y\\)-intercept. </li>\n  <li> The \\(x\\)-intercept tells us where a graph intersects the \\(x\\)-axis, at which point the \\(y\\)-value is 0. To find where the graph intersects the \\(x\\)-axis, find the solution to \\(0=mx+b\\). </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tell students that, when written in certain forms, quadratic expressions also tell us information about their graphs, and vice versa. We'll explore these connections in this lesson and upcoming ones.</p>"
