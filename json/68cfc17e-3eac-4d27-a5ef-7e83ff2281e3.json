Analyzing graphs and communicating observations\n    about them require attention to precision. Students also apply these insights\n    to solve more challenging contextual problems. This work involves making sense\n    of the information needed to solve the problems.</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher\n  Facing) </h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<div>\n  <ul>\n    <li><span>Analyze given information about a situation\n        involving multiple constraints to determine what additional information is\n        needed to solve problems.</span></li>\n    <li>Explain (orally and in writing) how to tell if a\n      pair of values is a solution to the system, given a system of inequalities and\n      their graphs.</li>\n    <li>Practice writing systems of inequalities in two\n      variables and finding the solution sets by reasoning or by graphing.</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n<h4>Learning Targets\n  (Student Facing) </h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>Explain how to tell if a point on the boundary of the\n    graph of the solutions to a system of inequalities is a solution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential\n  Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<table border=\"1\" width=\"624\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td valign=\"top\" width=\"312\">\n        <p align=\"center\"><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td valign=\"top\" width=\"312\">\n        <p align=\"center\"><strong>Explanation\n            of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td valign=\"top\" width=\"312\">\n        <p>A3(H) graph the\n          solution set of systems of two linear inequalities in two variables on the\n          coordinate plane.</p>\n      </td>\n      <td valign=\"top\" width=\"312\">\n        <p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this\n          TEKS.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<div>\n  <h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n  <p><span>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</span><br></p>\n</div>\n<ul>\n  <li><span>2.14.1: Analyzing Graphs that Represent Linear Equations and Inequalities</span></li>\n  <li>2.14.2: Determining if Points on Boundary Lines Are Solutions to a System</li>\n  <li>2.14.2: Self Check</li>\n  <li>2.14.2: Additional Resources</li>\n  <li>2.14.3: Solving Problems to Satisfy Multiple Constraints Simultaneously</li>\n  <li>2.14.3: Self Check</li>\n  <li>2.14.3: Additional Resources</li>\n  <li>2.14.4: Identifying Graph Regions Included in a System&rsquo;s Solution</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 2.14.5: Practice.</span><br></p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<div>\n  <p>Pre-printed slips, cut from copies of the\n    blackline master of data and problem cards<br><span>Coordinate Grids</span><br></p>\n</div>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<div>\n  <ul>\n    <li>N/A</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n<div>\n  <h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n  <p>During this lesson, it is\n    important to:</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see\n      throughout the lesson.
