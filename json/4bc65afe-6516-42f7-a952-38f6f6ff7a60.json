The graph shows the equation of the line&nbsp;\\( y = 2x - 3. \\) The point&nbsp;\\( P \\)&nbsp;\\( (-2, 1) \\) is also plotted. You can use the fact that parallel lines have the same slope to find a line that is parallel to line \\(m\\) and goes through point \\( P \\) \\( (-2, 1) \\).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img alt=\"This figure has a graph of a straight line and a point on the x y-coordinate plane. The x and y-axes run from negative 8 to 8. The line goes through the points (0, negative 3), (1, negative 1), and (2, 1). The point (negative 2, 1) is plotted.

The second line will pass through \\(&nbsp;(-2, 1)&nbsp;\\) and have slope 2. To graph the line, start at \\(&nbsp;(-2, 1)&nbsp;\\) and count out the rise and run. The slope is \\( \\frac{rise}{run}=\\frac{2}{1} \\). Count out the rise, 2, and run, 1, and plot the point. You can graph the line as shown.
