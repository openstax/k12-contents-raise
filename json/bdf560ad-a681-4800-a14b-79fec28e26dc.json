This motivates a desire to represent both constraints on the same graph.</span><br></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>As students work, monitor for the different ways students try to find a pair of values that satisfies both inequalities. Some likely approaches:</li>\n  <li>Substituting different values into the inequalities until they find a pair that makes both inequalities true.</li>\n  <li>Visually estimating a point in the solution region of one graph that appears likely to be in the solution region of the other graph (for example, noticing that it is in the solution region of each inequality).</li>\n  <li>Graphing both inequalities on the same coordinate plane (either by using technology or by copying the line in one graph onto the other graph) and finding a point in the region where they overlap.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>Identify students who use these or other approaches and ask them to share during class discussion.</p>\n<h4>Launch&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>Give students a moment to read the task statement and look at the two graphs. Ask students:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>&ldquo;What are the two constraints in this situation?&rdquo; (A length constraint and a cost constraint)</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;Which graph represents which constraint? How do you know?&rdquo; (The first graph represents the length constraint. Possible explanations:<ul>\n      <li>The graph intersects the vertical and horizontal axes at approximately 9.5, which means that if the quilter bought 0 yards of one color, he will need at least 9.5 yards of the other color.</li>\n      <li>The length constraint says &ldquo;at least 9.5 yards,&rdquo; so the lengths must include values greater than 9.5, which is shown by the shaded region of the first graph.</li>\n      <li>The second graph represents the cost constraint. If the quilter bought 0 yards of the light color, he could buy up to \\(\\frac{110}{13}\\), or about 8.5, yards of the dark color fabric. This corresponds to the vertical intercept of the second graph.&nbsp;</li>\n      <li>The cost constraint says &ldquo;up to $110,&rdquo; so the lengths must be below certain limits. The solution region of the second graph shows values below a boundary.)</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 2 and provide access to graphing technology, in case it is requested.</p>\n<p>Ask students to pause briefly after they have written both inequalities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Verify that the inequalities students have written accurately represent the constraints before they proceed to the rest of the activity.</p>\n<h4>Access for Students with Disabilities</h4>\n<div>\n  <p><em>Engagement: Develop Effort and Persistence. </em>Encourage and support opportunities for peer interactions. During the time spent on the two questions in the launch, invite students to brainstorm with a partner before sharing with the whole class.

Consider discussing with students why it makes sense in this situation to disregard negative values.)</span><br></p>\n<p>Discuss the meaning of a pair of values that satisfies both inequalities. Emphasize that in this situation, it refers to the amount of fabric of each color that meets both the length and cost requirements.</p>\n<p>Explain to students that the two inequalities representing the constraints in the same situation form a system of linear inequalities. In a system of linear equations, the solutions can be represented by one or more points where the graphs of the equations intersect. The solutions to a system of inequalities are all points in the region where the graphs of the two inequalities overlap because those points represent all pairs of values that make both inequalities true.</p>\n<h4>2.13.2: Self Check&nbsp;</h4>\n<p><strong><em>Following the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<div align=\"left\">\n  <table cellpadding=\"5\">\n    <colgroup>\n      <col>\n      <col>\n    </colgroup>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td colspan=\"2\">\n          <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> A singer sold two types of tickets to a performance, seated tickets and standing-room tickets.</p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              Seated tickets cost $25.</li>\n            <li>Standing-room tickets cost $15.\n            </li>\n            <li>More than 60 tickets were sold.\n            </li>\n            <li>More than $1,200 was made from selling tickets.\n            </li>\n          </ul><br>\n          <p>Which of the following ticket combinations is possible given the situation described here?&nbsp;</p><br>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p>14 seated tickets and 55 standing-room tickets</p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p>Incorrect.
