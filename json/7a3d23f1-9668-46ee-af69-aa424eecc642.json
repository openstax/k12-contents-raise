To do so, they need to interpret statements in function notation and connect their interpretations to the graph of the function.</p>\n<p>Previously, students recognized that if a point with coordinates \\((2,20)\\) is on the graph of a function, the 2 is an input and the 20 is a corresponding output. Here, they begin to see the second value in a coordinate pair more abstractly, as \\(f(2)\\) when the input is 2, or as \\(f(4)\\) when the input is 4.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Give students 1&ndash;2 minutes of quiet think time. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>\n<p>Some students might be unfamiliar with drones. If needed, give a brief explanation of what they are.</p>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>\n<p><img alt=\"a drone flying\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/3549f9fb392a0a4dd582f0fe064c6c89e01646bb\" width=\"250\"></p>\n<br>\n<p>Here is a graph that represents function \\(f\\), which gives the height of a drone, in meters, \\(t\\) seconds after it leaves the ground.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Graph. Horizontal axis, 0 to 8, time, seconds. Vertical axis, height, meters. Starting at 0 comma 0, the graph increases linearly. From 2 to 6, it&rsquo;s horizontal. Then decreases linearly to 7 comma 0.\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/3192aada43883aac8e77e8ee8af08927d79ed818\"></p>\n<p>Decide which function value is greater.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>\\(f(0)\\) or \\(f(4)\\)</li>\n  <li>\\(f(2)\\) or \\(f(5)\\)</li>\n  <li>\\(f(3)\\) or \\(f(7)\\)</li>\n  <li>\\(f(t)\\) or \\(f(t+1)\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>\\(f(4)\\)</li>\n  <li>They are equal.</li>\n  <li>\\(f(3)\\)</li>\n  <li>It depends on the value of \\(t\\).</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Invite students to share how they compared each pair of outputs. If not mentioned in students&rsquo; explanations, point out that for each pair, what we are comparing are the vertical values of the points on the graph at different horizontal values. Even though the statements don&rsquo;t tell us the values of, say, \\(f(3)\\) and \\(f(7)\\), and the vertical axis shows no scale, we can tell from the graph that the function has a greater value when \\(t\\) is 3 than when \\(t\\) is 7.</p>\n<p>Tell students that the coordinates \\((0,f(0))\\) represent the starting point of the drone. Ask students, &ldquo;What are the coordinates of the points when the drone starts leveling off? When it starts to descend? When it lands?&rdquo; (\\((2,f(2))\\), \\((5,f(5))\\), and \\((7,f(7))\\), respectively.)</p>\n<p>Highlight that the coordinates of each point on a graph of a function are \\((x,f(x))\\).</p>\n<p>Discuss with students how they compared \\(f(t)\\) and \\(f(t+1)\\) (in the last question). Make sure students see that \\(f(t+1)\\) could be less than, equal to, or greater than \\(f(t)\\), depending on the value of \\(t\\).</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>If \\(t\\) is 2, then \\(t+1\\) is 3. From the graph, we can see that \\(f(2)\\) is equal to \\(f(3)\\) because the graph has the same vertical value when \\(t\\) is 2 and 3.</li>\n  <li>If \\(t\\) is 5, then \\(t+1\\) is 6. From the graph, we can see that \\(f(5)\\) is greater than \\(f(6)\\) because the graph has a greater vertical value when \\(t\\) is 5 than when \\(t\\) is 6.</li>\n</ul>"
