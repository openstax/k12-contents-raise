They then described each relationship in words and identified a corresponding equation. In that activity, all relationships were linear.</p>\n      <p>This activity offers new opportunities to identify and represent relationships between pairs of quantities. In each of the first two situations, the relationship is an inverse variation. (Students do not need to know the term or the concept to be able to reason about the relationships.) The last situation involves a proportional relationship. Because the given information involves three quantities (volume in gallons, in cups, and in fluid ounces), students need to reason carefully about how two of them (volume in gallons and in fluid ounces) are related.</p>\n      <p>Monitor for different ways students use to figure out and articulate how the quantities are related. For instance, students may:</p>\n      <p></p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Use broad and qualitative descriptions (&ldquo;As the base length increases, the height decreases&rdquo;).</li>\n        <li>Give specific and quantitative descriptions (&ldquo;The product of the base length and the height is always 48&rdquo;).</li>\n        <li>Use diagrams, tables, graphs, or equations to make sense of the relationships and to illustrate them.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p></p>\n      <p>Identify students using varying strategies and ask them to share during discussion later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n  <p></p>\n</div>\n<h3>Launch</h3>\n<p>Tell students that they will now describe the relationship between two quantities in some new situations.</p>\n<p>If time is limited, ask students to focus on the first two questions.</p>\n<p>With more time, there are opportunities to make this problem set more interesting. Ideas to increase student engagement are listed below:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>For students who finish the first activity early, provide graph paper to start drawing the parallelograms indicated in the length/height table. These copies can be handed out to different groups as needed.</li>\n  <li>Have students actually guess the number of beans (or other objects) in a jar. While other students go on to the next activity, let someone who already understands the topic pretty well count the results.</li>\n  <li>If possible, bringing measurement containers/liquid (and paper towels!) can add engagement for the jug problem.</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n<div><em>Action and Expression: Develop Expression and Communication.</em> Provide options for communicating understanding.

Encourage them to look at the upper rows in the table and to also look at the relationships between the values in the columns.</p>\n  <p>Some students may have trouble getting started on the question about the volume of milk or setting up a table. Ask students which units are given in the problem, or suggest the headings &ldquo;gallons,&rdquo; &ldquo;cups,&rdquo; and &ldquo;fluid ounces.&rdquo; Then, ask them to use the given information to complete a row in the table. This might involve trying a different unit to start with. (For example, if they start with \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) gallon and struggle to find the equivalent amount in cups and fluid ounces, try starting with &ldquo;4 cups&rdquo; or &ldquo;8 cups.&rdquo;) A more direct hint is to suggest finding the number of fluid ounces in 8 cups.</p>\n  <h2>Activity Synthesis</h2>\n  <div>\n    <p>Select previously identified students to share their responses and thinking. Sequence the presentation in the order of precision, starting with the broader descriptions or illustrations and ending with equations. (Remind students who use equations to specify what the variables represent.) If students write equations in different forms to describe the same relationship, record and display the equivalent equations for all to see.</p>\n    <p>If no students considered using tables to make sense of the pairs of quantities, ask how these would help and show an example. A table, for instance, can be particularly helpful for reasoning about the last two relationships.</p>\n    <p>Display the equations that can represent the three situations. Highlight that writing equations is an efficient way to capture the constraints in a situation<span>.</span></p>\n    <p>\\( b*h = 48&nbsp;\\) or \\( h = \\frac{48}{b} \\)</p>\n    <p>\\(&nbsp;a*n=300&nbsp;\\) or \\(&nbsp;a=\\frac{300}{n} \\)</p>\n    <p>\\(&nbsp;f=128g \\)<br></p>\n    <p>To help students connect the equations to prior work, ask students which quantities vary and which remain constant in each equation.
