By undoing FOIL, students can reverse the process used to multiply binomials and find the factored form of the trinomials.</p>\n<p>This lesson also introduces multiple ways to factor trinomials of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\). The simplest way is to factor out the GCF and determine what simplifies the form of the trinomial. If the form is still \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\), then students may choose from trial and error and the &ldquo;\\(ac\\)&rdquo; method. The &ldquo;\\(ac\\)&rdquo; method will work for any trinomial of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\).</p>\n<p>If a polynomial does not seem to fit the known forms for factoring, it may be possible to substitute the variable \\(u\\) for an expression, thus simplifying the trinomial into a more recognizable form. The trinomial can then be factored, and the original expression is then substituted back in for \\(u\\).</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Factor trinomials of the form \\(x^2 + bx + c\\) by undoing FOIL. </li>\n  <li> Factor trinomials of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) using trial and error to guess the binomial factors of the factored form. </li>\n  <li> Factor trinomials of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) using the &ldquo;\\(ac\\)&rdquo; method to factor any trinomial. </li>\n  <li> Factor trinomials that do not readily appear to be of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) by substituting \\(u\\)<em> f</em>or a value before factoring. </li>\n  <li> Analyze a trinomial and determine their own way of factoring. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li> Factor trinomials of the form \\(x^2 + bx + c\\). </li>\n  <li> Factor trinomials of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) using trial and error. </li>\n  <li> Factor trinomials of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) using the &ldquo;\\(ac\\)&rdquo; method. </li>\n  <li> Factor trinomials using substitution. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>A10(E) <u>factor, if possible, trinomials with real factors in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\)</u>, including perfect square trinomials of degree two; and</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Partial coverage: Lesson provides content that covers part of this TEKS.
