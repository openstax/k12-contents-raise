They write an inequality that represents the constraints in a situation, graph its solutions, and interpret points in the solution region.</p>\n  <p>Earlier, students saw that some points in the solution region might satisfy an inequality (mathematically) but might not work in the given situation because other considerations were at play. Here, they see another reason that some values that satisfy an inequality might be unfeasible in the situation-namely, that the pair of values must be whole numbers.</p>\n  <p>As students work, look for those who plot discrete points to represent the solution region and those who shade a part of the plane.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Launch</h3>\n<div>\n  <p>Arrange (or keep) students in groups of 2. Give students a few minutes of quiet time to work on the first three questions, and then time to discuss their responses before they continue with the last two questions.</p>\n  <p>Emphasize that by analyzing the different combinations of necklaces and bracelets that can be made and sold, the vendor can prepare each week by making the right amount of each piece of jewelry. This information can also be used&nbsp; to try to ensure that the vendor makes $100 in profit every week.</p>\n  <h4>Support for Students with Disabilities</h4>\n  <div>\n    <p><em></em><em>Representation: Internalize Comprehension.&nbsp;</em>To support working memory, provide students with sticky notes or mini whiteboards. Some students may need extra time to explore possible combinations for multiples of 9 and 5. Encourage them to model these combinations by drawing pictures or listing multiples of each number using the whiteboard or sticky notes.<br><em>Supports accessibility for: Memory; Organization</em><em></em></p>\n  </div>\n  <div><em><br></em></div>\n</div>\n<h3>Student Facing Statement</h3>\n<div>\n  <p>A vendor at the Saturday Market makes&nbsp;<span>$</span>9 profit on each necklace she sells and&nbsp;<span>$</span>5 profit on each bracelet.</p>\n  <p>1.

They may also respond with&nbsp;\\( x &lt; \\text{infinity} \\)&nbsp;or something similar. Both of these tacks deserve praise, but tell students that this problem really is possible using real numbers. Students may ultimately need the hint that they will need to leave the realm of linear inequalities to answer these questions.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>\n<div>\n  <p>Some students may have trouble graphing the line that delineates the solution region from non-solution region because they are used to solving for the variable&nbsp;\\( y \\), but here the variables are&nbsp;\\( b \\)&nbsp;and&nbsp;\\( n \\). Ask these students to decide which variable to solve for based on the graph that has been set up. Ask them to notice which quantity is represented by the vertical axis.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>\n<div>\n  <p>If some students plotted discrete points and some shaded the region, choose one of each and display these for all to see. Ask students why each one might be an appropriate representation of the solutions to the inequality.</p>\n  <p>Highlight that the discrete points represent the situation more accurately, because it is impossible to sell a fraction of a bracelet or 2.75 necklaces. It is, however, tedious to plot a bunch of points to show the solution region. It is much easier to shade the entire region, but with the understanding that, in this situation, only whole-number values make sense as solutions.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n</div>\n<h4>2.10.3: Self Check&nbsp;</h4>\n<p><strong><em>Following the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\"><strong>QUESTION:<br></strong>\n        <p><span lang=\"EN\">An artist is designing a\n            sculpture to be displayed hanging in the lobby of a museum.
