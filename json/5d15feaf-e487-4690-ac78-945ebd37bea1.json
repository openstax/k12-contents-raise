To prepare for that work, students review writing and graphing an equation that represents a situation.</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<div>\n  <p>If needed, explain or show additional images of grass sod and flower beds to students who might be unfamiliar with these landscaping terms.</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>\n<div>\n  <div>\n    <div>\n      <div>\n        <p>A homeowner is making plans to landscape her yard. She plans to hire professionals to install grass sod in some parts of the yard and flower beds in other parts.</p>\n        <p>Grass sod installation costs&nbsp;<span>$</span>2 per square foot and flower bed installation costs&nbsp;<span>$</span>12 per square foot. Her budget for the project is&nbsp;<span>$</span>3,000.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <div><img alt=\"Rocks in a garden\" class=\"img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/fccfcb59c9c86aab54efb19476ba951102ee2166\" width=\"600\"></div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div><span><br>1. Write an equation that represents the square feet of grass sod,&nbsp;\\( x \\), and the square feet of flower beds,&nbsp;\\( y \\), that she could afford if she used her entire budget.</span>\n</div>\n<div><span><br></span></div>\n<div><span>2. On the coordinate plane, or using a graphing calculator, sketch a graph that represents your equation. Be prepared to explain your reasoning.<br></span><br><img alt=\"Blank grid, origin O.

Discuss with students:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\"In this situation, what does a point on the line mean?\" (A combination of square feet of grass sod and square feet of flower beds that the homeowner could have if she spent her entire budget.)</li>\n    <li>\"What does the vertical intercept of the graph mean?\" (The square feet of flower beds she could have if she installs no grass sod.)</li>\n    <li>\"What does the horizontal intercept of the graph tell us?\" (The square feet of grass sod she could install if she installs no flower beds.)</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>"
