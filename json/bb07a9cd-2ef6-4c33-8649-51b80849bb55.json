Students measure the approximate\n    lengths of the humerus bone and height of their classmates to collect\n    data and create a linear model. The model is then used to approximate\n    the height of an ancient human based on the length of a found humerus\n    bone.</p>\n  <p>Making graphing technology\n    available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools\n    strategically (TEKS 1C and 1D). By collecting their own data and using a best fit\n    line to find additional information, students are modeling with\n    mathematics (TEKS 1C and 1D).</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Launch</h3>\n<div>\n  <p>Arrange students in groups of 2\n    to 4. Present the task to students and ask students to brainstorm\n    different ways that they could answer the question. After 2 minutes of\n    quiet think time, ask students to share their ideas with the class. The\n    remaining time should be used by students to collect, analyze,\n    summarize, and interpret the data.</p>\n  <h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>\n  <div>\n    <em>Speaking, Reading: MLR5 Co-Craft Questions.</em>\n    Use this routine to help students further interpret and increase\n    awareness of the language used to talk about scatter plots, best fit\n    lines, residuals and correlation coefficients. Display the first\n    sentence of this problem (\"An anthropologist finds a fossilized humerus\n    bone of an ancient human ancestor.\"), and ask students to write down\n    possible mathematical questions that could be asked about the situation.\n    Invite students to compare their questions before revealing the\n    remainder of the question. Listen for and amplify any questions\n    involving comparing bivariate data.<br>\n  </div>\n  <div><em><br></em>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h3>Student Facing Statement</h3>\n<div>\n  <div><img alt=\"Arm skeletal system\" height=\"432\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/94d8f9fd69e17df2daf533e213efd1530dcd62bf\" width=\"276\"></div>\n  <p>An anthropologist finds a fossilized humerus bone of an ancient human\n    ancestor. The humerus is an arm bone running from the shoulder to the\n    elbow. It is 24 centimeters in length. Use data from your classmates to\n    estimate the height of this ancient human.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Student Response</h3>\n<div>\n  <p>Sample response: About 123 centimeters (around 4 feet). I measured\n    the humerus and height of several classmates and created a scatter plot.\n    I used a plot of the residuals and found that a linear model seemed to\n    be appropriate. I then found the line of best fit to be about \\( y = 5.1 x + 0.2 \\), where \\( y \\) is the height in centimeters and \\( x \\) is the length of the humerus in centimeters. Using 24 centimeters for \\( x \\), I found that \\( 5.1 \\cdot 24 + 0.2 = 122.6 \\), which I rounded since this is a rough estimate.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>\n<div>\n  <p>Students may find it difficult to start to answer the question. Ask\n    students what are the variables given in the situation. Ask students if\n    there is a way we could collect information from people in the classroom\n    to help answer the question.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>\n<div>\n  <p>The purpose of this discussion is for students to communicate how they used mathematics to justify their findings.</p>\n  <p>Ask students:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\"How confident are you in your answer? What information helped\n      you determine your confidence?\" (Not very confident. Since the\n      correlation coefficient is near 0.6, there is only a moderate\n      relationship between height and humerus length. Additionally, this\n      ancient human ancestor may have a different anatomy-for example, apes\n      tend to have proportionally longer arms than humans do.)</li>\n    <li>\"How did you use mathematics to estimate the height of the ancient\n      human?\" (First, I collected data on the height and the approximate\n      length of the humerus of my classmates. I then made a scatter plot to\n      determine whether or not a linear model was appropriate, and then\n      computed a line of best fit. I substituted 24 centimeters into my line\n      of best fit and obtained my answer.)</li>\n    <li>\"Do you think that the way you measured the humerus of your\n      classmates impacted your choice of linear model? Explain your\n      reasoning.\" (Yes, I think that I probably overestimated the bone length,\n      because I was measuring from the outside and not the inside. I think\n      that my model likely overestimates height.)</li>\n  </ul>\n</div><br>"
