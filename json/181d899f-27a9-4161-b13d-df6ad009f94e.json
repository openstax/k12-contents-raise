You looked at patterns in exponents to determine the value of zero as an exponent and applied the basic rules of exponents with zero. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li><span>5.4.2: Self Check</span><br></li>\n  <ul>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 5.4.3: Exponential Change: The Growth Factor </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> In this activity, you learned to continue the exponential growth tables to the equations of the form \\(y=a\\cdot b^x\\). </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li><span>5.4.3: Self Check</span><br></li>\n  <ul>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 5.4.4: Graphing Exponential Expressions </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> In this activity, you continued working with the multiple representations of exponential functions. During this activity, you expanded upon the table that was created in 5.4.3 and represented it in a graph. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li><span>5.4.4: Self Check</span><br></li>\n  <ul>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 5.4.5: Interpret the Growth Factor of the Equation </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> In this activity, you analyzed all of the parts of an exponential equation and what they meant in the context of a problem. </li>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 5.4.6: Practice </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <!--pulldown-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n      <p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n      <p>Correct!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n      <p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!--Do not edit below line.-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n</div>\n<br>"
