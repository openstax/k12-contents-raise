In this case, only whole-number values are meaningful for both variables (number of dimes and number of nickels). Students need to consider whether decimal solutions are reasonable in the situation.</p>\n        <p>Graphing the equation involves some decisions. The axes of the blank coordinate plane are not labeled, so students need to decide which quantity goes on which axis (and to recognize that the decision affects what each point on the graph represents). Students could also choose to draw a continuous graph (a line) or a discrete graph (points at integer values of one variable or both variables).&nbsp;</p>\n        <p>As students work, notice the graphing decisions students make. Identify students who draw a discrete graph to have them share their rationales during class discussion.</p>\n        <p>Students engage in quantitative and abstract reasoning as they think about the solutions and graph of an equation in context. They practice aspects of modeling as they write an equation for a constraint, decide on representations for the model, and reflect on whether the mathematical results make sense in the given situation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <h3>Launch</h3>\n      <div class=\"body\">\n        <p>Teachers may want to bring in coins (or ask students to) and ask students to create different combinations that will lead to 85 cents. This will lead into writing these combinations as equations.</p>\n        <p>Consider keeping students in groups of 3&ndash;4.</p>\n        <h4>Support for English Language Learners</h4>\n        <div class=\"c-annotation c-annotation--ell\">\n          <em>Speaking, Reading: MLR5 Co-Craft Questions. </em>Use this routine to provide opportunities for students to analyze how different mathematical forms and symbols can represent different situations.

Dividing the first equation, which represents the relationship in cents, by 100 gives the second equation, which represents the relationship in dollars. The same combinations of nickels and dimes make both equations true.)</li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n      <h4>1.10.3 Self Check</h4>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"activities\">\n      <p><strong><em>Following the\n            activity, students will answer the following question to check their\n            understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n      <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n        <tbody>\n          <tr>\n            <td colspan=\"2\"><strong>QUESTION:</strong><br><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-7b9f8e59-7fff-0b47-dffc-79607c92ea5c\">A coin jar contains 75 cents and only contains quarters and nickels. </span>Write an equation that relates the number of quarters, \\( q \\), the number of nickels, \\( n \\), and the amount of money, in cents, in the coin jar.</td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td>Answers</td>\n            <td>Feedback</td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td>\\( 25q + 5n = 75\\)</td>\n            <td><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-135a3e6e-7fff-dc11-c1ce-f6a2b99147c5\">That&rsquo;s correct!
