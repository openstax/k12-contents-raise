They analyze and interpret given equations, write equations to represent relationships and constraints, and work to solve these equations. In doing so, students see that sometimes solutions to quadratic equations cannot be easily or precisely found by graphing or reasoning.</p>\n<p>In an earlier unit, students saw that when a function is defined by a quadratic expression in factored form, the zeros of the function could be easily identified. Here, they notice that when a quadratic equation is written as factored form = 0, solving the equation is also relatively simple. This revelation motivates upcoming work on rewriting quadratic expressions into factored form.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> Recognize the limitations of certain strategies used to solve a quadratic equation. </li>\n<li> Explain that the factored form of a quadratic expression can help us find the zeros of a quadratic function and solve a quadratic equation. </li>\n<li> Write quadratic equations and reason about their solutions in terms of a situation. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> Recognize the factored form of a quadratic expression and know when it can be useful for solving problems. </li>\n<li> Use a graph to find the solutions to a quadratic equation but also know its limitations. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4> Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n<colgroup>\n<col>\n<col>\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><p><strong>TEKS</strong></p></td>\n<td><p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><p>A8(A) solve quadratic equations having real solutions by factoring, taking square roots, completing the square, and applying the quadratic formula.</p></td>\n<td><p>Foundational: Lesson provides foundational content necessary for students to be able to perform this TEKS in later lessons.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> 8.2.1: Interpreting Equations in Context </li>\n<li> 8.2.2: Exploring Non-Graphing Strategies to Solve Quadratic Equations </li>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"2\"> 8.2.2: Self Check </li>\n<li aria-level=\"2\"> 8.2.2: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 8.2.3: Solving a Quadratic Equation Set Equal to Zero </li>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"2\"> 8.2.3: Self Check </li>\n<li aria-level=\"2\"> 8.2.3: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 8.2.4: Solving a Real-World Problem Using Quadratic Equations </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 8.2.5: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> Paper and pencil </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> None </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson.
