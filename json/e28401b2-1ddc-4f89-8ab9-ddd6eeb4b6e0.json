This lesson contains many opportunities for you to notice and make use of structure, for example, noticing that \\(1,000+200+200+200+200\\) can be expressed as \\(1,000+200 \\cdot 4\\).</p>\n<p>You will examine two types of patterns by looking at tables, noting that one type is characterized by common differences and the other by common ratios. Then you will match different representations with two contexts. This is an opportunity for you to notice structure in expressions.</p>\n<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Compare growth patterns using calculations and graphs. </li>\n  <li> Use words and expressions to describe patterns in tables of values.</li>\n  <li> Write expressions and create tables of values to represent them using descriptions of linear and exponential relationships. </li>\n  <li> Begin making connections between linear and exponential growth and the real world (especially financially). </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 5.3.1: Creating a Pictorial Representation of Exponential Growth </li>\n  <li> 5.3.2: Exploring Different Growth Patterns\n    <ul>\n      <li>5.3.2: Self Check</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>5.3.3: Compare and Contrast Two Patterns<br>\n    <ul>\n      <li>5.3.3: Self Check</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li> 5.3.4: Match Expressions and Tables with Situations\n    <ul>\n      <li>5.3.4: Self Check</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li> 5.3.5: Describe Mathematically Changes in Growth </li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 5.3.6: Practice </li>\n  <li> 5.3.7: Summary </li>\n</ul>"
