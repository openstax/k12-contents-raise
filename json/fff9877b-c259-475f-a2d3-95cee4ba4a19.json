The revenue from ticket sales needs to cover the cost of the meals and entertainment and also make a profit of at least $200 to be contributed to the school.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here is some information they have gathered:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Last year, 120 people attended. It was a success and is expected to be even bigger this year. Up to 200 people will attend.</li>\n  <li>There needs to be at least 1 chaperone for every 20 students.</li>\n  <li>The ticket price cannot exceed $20 per person.</li>\n</ul>\n<!--Text Entry Interaction Start -->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"eventShow\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-content\">\n    <p>Here are some inequalities the seniors wrote about the situation.
