In particular, the focus for this activity was on how exponential functions have different rates of change for different input intervals, which is not the case for linear functions. </li>\n</ul><li><span>5.10.2: Se</span><span>lf Check</span><br></li><ul>\n</ul>\n<li> 5.10.3: Explore Average Rates of Change in an Exponential Decay Context </li>\n<ul>\n<li> In this activity, you continued to explore average rates of change for exponential functions. This time, you focused on a previously encountered exponential decay context. </li>\n</ul><li><span>5.10.3: Self Ch</span><span>eck</span><br></li><ul>\n</ul>\n<li> 5.10.4: Average Rate of Change </li>\n<ul>\n<li> In this activity, you found the average rate of change and explored how well the average rate of change describes how something changes over time. </li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 5.10.5: Practice </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<!--pulldown-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n<p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<p>Correct!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!--Do not edit below line.-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n</div>"
