They learn that, even though the numbers are not as straightforward as in equations they have previously seen, they can still solve the equations by completing the square. The less-friendly numbers and the more elaborate equations make the computations more challenging, so students need to attend to precision and mind the steps for rearranging parts of the equations, as well as the signs of the numbers, especially negative numbers.</p>\n<p>As students work, they may need to be reminded to rewrite the equation in a different form, isolate a term to make it easier to complete the square, apply the zero product property only when a product is equal to zero, and so on. Make note of common errors or hurdles and address them during whole-class discussion.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Give students a moment to look at the list of equations and notice how they are like or unlike other equations they have seen and solved before. Invite students to share some observations. They may notice, for instance:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> \\((x&minus;3)(x+1)=5\\) does not have 0 on one side, so we cannot use the zero product property right away. </li>\n  <li> \\(x^2+\\frac{1}{2}x=\\frac{3}{16}\\) and \\(x^2+3x+\\frac{8}{4}=0\\) involve fractions. </li>\n  <li> \\(x^2+3x+\\frac{8}{4}=0\\) has an odd number for the coefficient of the linear term. </li>\n  <li> \\((7&minus;x)(3&minus;x)+3=0\\) has 0 on one side but the other side is a sum, not a product. </li>\n  <li> \\(x^2+1.6x+0.63=0\\) has decimals. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Explain to students that each equation can be solved by completing the square and using the same reasoning as when we solved simpler-looking equations earlier.</p>\n<p>Consider arranging students in groups of two. If there is not enough time for students to answer all the questions, consider asking students to look at the list of equations and to choose one they think looks easier (or more familiar) and one that looks harder (or less familiar).</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>Completing the square can be used to solve quadratic equations.</p>\n<p>Example: Solve \\(x^2+8x-2=0\\).</p>\n<p>To complete the square to solve an equation, follow these steps:</p>\n<p>Step 1<br>\n  Write the equation in the form \\(ax^2+bx=c\\).<br>\n  \\(x^2+8x=-2\\)</p>\n<p>Step 2<br>\n  Complete the square by finding \\((\\frac{b}{2})^2\\).<br>\n  \\((\\frac{b}{2})^2=(\\frac{8}{2})^2=16\\)</p>\n<p>Step 3<br>\n  Add the value to both sides of the equation.<br>\n  \\(x^2+8x+16=-2+16\\)</p>\n<p>Step 4<br>\n  Factor the perfect square trinomial and simplify the constants.<br>\n  \\((x+4)^2=14\\)</p>\n<p>Step 5<br>\n  Take the square root of each side (remember the plus-minus sign with the constant).<br>\n  \\(\\sqrt{(x+4)^2}=\\sqrt{14}\\)<br>\n  \\(x+4= \\pm \\sqrt{14}\\)</p>\n<p>Step 6<br>\n  Write two separate equations and solve each.<br>\n  \\(x + 4 = \\sqrt{14}\\) &nbsp;or&nbsp; \\(x + 4 =\\; - \\;\\sqrt{14}\\)<br>\n  \\(x = -4 + \\sqrt{14}\\) &nbsp;or&nbsp; \\(x =\\; -\\;4\\; -\\; \\sqrt{14}\\)</p>\n<p>Solve each equation by completing the square.

Encourage these students to use completing the square to solve a more familiar problem first, such as \\(x^2&minus;10x+20=4\\), and then to use the structure of the process they followed as a guide to help them solve these more challenging problems.</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Select students to share their solutions and display their work for all to see. If students found solutions that differ from each other, as time permits, invite these students to describe their thinking to the class, and encourage them to try to identify any errors and determine which solutions are correct. Discuss any common challenges or errors.</p>\n<p>Make sure students understand that the process of solving by completing the square is the same whether the numbers in the equations are integers or other rational numbers. Elicit from students a generalization of the process. For example:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Start with a quadratic expression in standard form on one side of the equal sign and a number (which could be 0) on the other side. </li>\n  <li> Take half of the coefficient of the linear term and square it. The result is the constant term that would make the quadratic expression a perfect square. </li>\n  <li> Perform the same operations to both sides of the equal sign so that the constant term that is on one side is a perfect square that makes the expression a perfect square. </li>\n  <li> Rewrite the expression (in standard form) as a squared factor. </li>\n  <li> Find both values of the factor that, when squared, give the number on the other side of the equal sign. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>To scaffold instruction, provide a blank template with the steps for students to follow as they solve equations.</p>\n<h3>9.3.2: Self Check&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>\n        <p>After solving using completing the square, what are the zeros of the quadratic equation \\(x^2+5x+ \\frac{9}{4}=0\\) ?</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x=\\frac{1}{4}\\) , \\(x=-\\frac{19}{4}\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incorrect.

For example, let's solve this equation:</p>\n<p>\\(x^2 + 5x - \\frac{75}{4}=0\\)</p>\n<p>First, we'll add \\(\\frac{75}{4}\\) to each side to make things easier on ourselves.</p>\n<p>\\(x^2+5x-\\frac{75}{4}+\\frac{75}{4}=0+\\frac{75}{4}\\)</p>\n<p class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\\(x^2+5x=\\frac{75}{4}\\)</p>\n<p>To complete the square, take \\(\\frac12\\) of the coefficient of the linear term 5, which is \\(\\frac52\\), and square it, which is \\(\\frac{25}{4}\\).
