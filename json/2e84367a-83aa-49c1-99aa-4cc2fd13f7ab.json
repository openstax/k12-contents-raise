In this lesson, you will revisit what you learned about solutions to equations in one variable and two variables. You will also continue to practice modeling relationships with equations and to make sense of equations and their solutions in context.</p>\n<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Explain what it means for a value or pair of values to be a solution to an equation.</li>\n  <li><span>Find solutions to equations by reasoning about a situation or by using algebra.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>Here are the <strong>activities </strong>that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>1.4.1: Finding the Solution to an Equation in One Variable, Part 1</li>\n  <li>1.4.2: Writing Equations to Represent Constraints</li>\n  <li>1.4.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>1.4.3: Finding the Solution to an Equation in Two Variables</li>\n  <li>1.4.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>1.4.4: Finding the Solution to an Equation in One Variable, Part 2</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>1.4.5: Practice</li>\n  <li>1.4.6: Lesson Summary</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>"
