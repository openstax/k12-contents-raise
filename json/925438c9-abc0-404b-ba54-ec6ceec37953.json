They can be used not only to find the output, but also the input.</p>\n<p>To help students see these points, discuss questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Could you use direct variation equations if you had the output and had to find the input?</li>\n<li>For example 1, how many minutes would Raoul have to use the treadmill to burn 500 calories?</li>\n<li>For example 2, how many minutes would Arnold have exercise to burn 500 calories?</li>\n<li>For example 3, how long would it take the train to go 800 miles?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tell students that equations are mathematical models. A model is a mathematical representation of a real-life situation. When people create models, they rely on the information they have, but they also make assumptions and decisions that affect the models. If the information or assumptions change, the model would also change.</p>"
