While students may notice and wonder many things about this table, the patterns are the important discussion points, rather than an attempt to find a rule for the function. Because the rule is not easy to uncover, studying the numbers ahead of time should prove helpful as students analyze the function later.</p>\n<p>This prompt gives students opportunities to see and make use of structure. The specific structure they might notice is all the \\(y\\)-values are multiples of 16 and perfect squares. Some may notice the pattern is not linear and wonder whether it is quadratic.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Have students write down their thoughts about what they notice and wonder in the table. Then, have them turn and talk with a partner. Ask pairs to share their thoughts with the class and add to a growing list. If some of the sample answers are not present, then ask questions to facilitate their addition to the class list.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>Study the table. What do you notice? What do you wonder?</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"43\">\n    <col width=\"46\">\n    <col width=\"46\">\n    <col width=\"46\">\n    <col width=\"46\">\n    <col width=\"46\">\n    <col width=\"46\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>\\(x\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>0</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>1</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>2</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>3</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>4</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>5</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>\\(y\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>0</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>16</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>64</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>144</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>256</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>400</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>\n<p>Things you may notice:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> The \\(x\\)-values increment by 1 as you move across the table. </li>\n  <li> The \\(y\\)-values increase. </li>\n  <li> All \\(y\\)-values are even and divisible by 4, 8, and 16. </li>\n  <li> The \\(y\\)-values are all perfect squares. </li>\n  <li> The successive differences between the \\(y\\)-values are growing. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Things you may wonder:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Is there a rule for these numbers? </li>\n  <li> Do the numbers represent the growth of a geometric pattern? </li>\n  <li> Do the numbers represent a quadratic relationship? </li>\n  <li> What is the next number in the table? </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Invite students to share their observations and questions. Record and display them for all to see.</p>\n<p>After all responses are recorded, tell students that they will investigate these values more closely in upcoming activities.</p>"
