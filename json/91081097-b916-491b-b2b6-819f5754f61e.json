You will be given a system that represents the\n    quantities and constraints in a situation and learn to interpret, in context,\n    the solutions to the individual equations and to the system. Ultimately, the\n    context will be used to make sense of the sum of the two equations and why it\n    shares a solution with the equations in the given system. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">When you finish\n    this lesson, you will be able to:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">Explain why\n      adding or subtracting two equations that share a solution results in a new\n      equation that also shares the same solution.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<!--[if !supportLists]-->\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Here are the <b>activities</b> that will help you reach those goals:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>2.4.1: Writing and Evaluating New Equations</span><br></li>\n<li>2.4.2: Adding Two Equations in a System</li>\n<li>2.4.2: Self Check</li>\n<li>2.4.3: Solving Systems of Linear Equations in Two Variables</li>\n<li>2.4.3: Self Check</li>\n<li>2.4.4: Solving Systems of Equations Using Real-World Examples&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">After\n    that, you&rsquo;ll <b>practice and review</b>.</span><b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">2.4.5: Practice</span></li>\n<li><span lang=\"EN\">2.4.6: Lesson Summary</span></li>\n</ul>\n<!--[if !supportLists]-->\n<div>\n</div>"
