The loss in value of the truck will therefore be $17,000, which is $3,400 per year for five years.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The truck will be worth $21,600 after the first year; $18,200 after two years; $14,800 after three years; $11,400 after four years; and $8,000 at the end of five years.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The values of the truck in the example are said to form an arithmetic sequence because they change by a constant amount each year. Each term increases or decreases by the same constant value called the common difference of the sequence. For this sequence, the common difference is &ndash;3,400.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"ARITHMETIC SEQUENCE WITH SIX TERMS WITH A COMMON DIFFERENCE OF NEGATIVE THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED, STARTING WITH A VALUE OF TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND AND ENDING WITH A VALUE OF EIGHT THOUSAND.\n\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b4ef05a451ee9ddbd41a3de6a0018926dcdbd443\" width=\"550\"></p>\n<p>The sequence below is another example of an arithmetic sequence. In this case, the common difference is 3.
