Previously, students reasoned about the solutions to an inequality in context. Here, they transition to solving an inequality without a context.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This activity offers another opportunity to point out the trouble with isolating the variable directly on the inequality statement, or with assuming that the solution set can be expressed using the same symbol as in the original inequality. (For example, if in the final step of solving students go from \\( -24x&le;-48 \\) to \\(x&le;2\\), they would end up with the wrong solution set.)</p>\n<h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>\n<div>\n  <div class=\"main\">\n    <div class=\"activities\">\n      <div class=\"activity\">\n        <ol>\n          <li>Solve this equation and check your solution: <span class=\"math\">\\(-\\frac{4(x+3)}5 = 4x-12 \\)</span>.\n          </li>\n          <li>Consider the inequality: <span class=\"math\">\\(-\\frac{4(x+3)}5 \\le 4x-12 \\)</span>.\n            <ol type=\"a\">\n              <li>Choose a couple of values less than 2 for <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( x \\)</span>.
