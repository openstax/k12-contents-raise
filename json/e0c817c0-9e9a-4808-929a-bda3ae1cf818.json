The vertex form also has a constant term: the \\(k\\) in \\(a(x&minus;h)^2+k\\). Are the two constant terms visible on the graph in the same way?\" (No. The \\(k\\) in vertex form gives us the \\(y\\)-coordinate of the vertex. The \\(c\\) in standard form gives us the y-coordinate of the \\(y\\)-intercept. That said, changing these parameters has the same effect of moving the graph up or down.) </li>\n<li> \"In both the vertex and standard form, the squared term \\(x^2\\) has a coefficient (which could be 1). Does this coefficient affect the graph in similar ways?\" (Yes, they both influence the direction of the opening of the function's graph and how wide or narrow the opening is.) </li>\n</ul>"
