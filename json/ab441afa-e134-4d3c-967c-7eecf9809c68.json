In most cases, students were given some information about the units of measurement of at least one quantity, which helped them reason about the functions being represented.</p>\n<p>In this activity, students encounter graphs without units on either of the axes. They interpret the graphs in the context of raising a flag and make a case for whether the graphs are realistic (which may depend on the units chosen for the axes). Students also see for the first time a graph that is a vertical line and think about why this graph does not represent a function.</p>\n<p>As students relate features of graphs to behaviors of quantities in a situation, they reason quantitatively and abstractly. In explaining and discussing why a graph is or is not realistic, students practice constructing logical arguments and critiquing the reasoning of others.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Show pictures of a flag ceremony and describe flag raising to students who might be unfamiliar with it. Consider sharing that, in some countries, students hold a flag-raising ceremony on a daily or weekly basis.</p>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Ask students to read the task statement and look at the graphs. Then, give students a moment of quiet time to think about the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>&ldquo;What might be reasonable units to use for the axes of the graphs?&rdquo;</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;How do we know that each graph represents a function?&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Give students a moment to share their thinking with their partner. Follow with a brief whole-class discussion.</p>\n<p>Students are likely to suggest seconds as a reasonable unit to use for time and meters or yards as a reasonable unit for height. If these units are not mentioned, ask students about them.</p>\n<p>Next, tell partners to take turns interpreting the graphs in the first question. Ask students to pause for a discussion before moving to the second question.</p>\n<p>If utilizing the extension, make sure students are given instructions on how to use graphing technology appropriately, even if it is a review. If students have not used this technology before, the teacher can still utilize the technology and show students the graphs to facilitate answering questions.</p>\n<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n<div>\n  <p>Encourage and support opportunities for peer interactions. Invite students to talk about their ideas with a partner before writing them down. Display sentence frames to support students when they explain their strategy. For example, &ldquo;I notice that . . .,&rdquo; &ldquo;I wonder . . .,&rdquo; and &ldquo;That could/couldn&rsquo;t be true because . . . .&rdquo;</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement </h4>\n<p>A flag ceremony is held at a Fourth of July event.

If time, \\(x\\), is measured in minutes, the distance in millimeters is \\(y=60x\\). </p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Explain why the equation \\(y=(365\\cdot24\\cdot3600)x\\) gives the distance the ant has traveled, in millimeters, as a function of time, \\(x\\), in years.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n  <li>Use graphing technology to graph the equation.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n  </li>\n  <ol type=\"a\">\n    <li>\\(x\\)-axis: time (years), \\(y\\)-axis: distance traveled (millimeters)\n      <br>\n      <br>\n    </li>\n    <li>Graph the equation on a coordinate grid or using graphing technology.\n      <br>\n      <br>\n    </li>\n    <li>Does the graph look like that of a function?

If the ant travels 1 millimeter a second, in one year, it would travel \\(365\\cdot24\\cdot3600\\) millimeters.

Consider asking partners to illustrate their response together&mdash;one partner explaining what is happening with the flag and the other acting out the action of the flag raiser.</p>\n<p>Discuss with students which graph is the most realistic and why. Also discuss whether using certain units of measurements would make an unrealistic graph more realistic, or vice versa. (For example, none of the graphs would be realistic if the time is measured in days or months and the height in kilometers or centimeters.)</p>\n<p>Next, solicit some explanations as to why the vertical line does not represent a function. If not mentioned in students&rsquo; explanations, bring up a key point: A vertical line can be interpreted to mean that for one particular input (3 units of time, in this case), there is an infinite number of possible outputs. Therefore, it cannot represent a function.</p>\n<h3>4.8.2: Self Check</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity. </em></strong></p>\n<div align=\"left\">\n  <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n    <colgroup>\n      <col width=\"302\">\n      <col width=\"322\">\n    </colgroup>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td colspan=\"2\">\n          <p><strong>QUESTION: </strong></p>\n          <p>Shannon is running on a flat, rocky trail that eventually rises up a steep mountain.
