Often, when a linear equation model uses real-world data, different letters are used for the variables, instead of using only x and y. The variable names remind us of what quantities are being measured.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The equation T = 1/4n + 40 is used to estimate the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, T, based on the number of cricket chirps, n, in one minute.

The T- intercept means when there are zero chirps, the temperature is 40 degrees.</span></p>\n<h4><span>Try It: Interpret Slope and y-Intercept</span></h4>\n<p><span><span></span></span></p>\n<p><span>Loreen has a calligraphy business.
