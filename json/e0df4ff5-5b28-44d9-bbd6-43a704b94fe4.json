Students will classify polynomials by number of terms and degree of exponent. Recognizing these differences will help students as they perform operations on polynomials of different types.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Review the new vocabulary defined at the start of the activity. After all the terms have been introduced, ask students to name a new polynomial of each type.</p>\n<p>Arrange students into groups of 2. Have them complete the first activity sorting different types of polynomials and then answer the questions.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>A monomial is an algebraic expression with exactly one term: \\(5x^2\\)</p>\n<p>A binomial is an algebraic expression with exactly two terms: \\(5x^2 + 6y^3\\)</p>\n<p>A trinomial is an algebraic expression with exactly three terms: \\(5x^2 + 6y^3 - 7c\\)</p>\n<p>Monomials, binomials, and trinomials are all different types of polynomials. A polynomial is a monomial or two or more monomials combined by addition or subtraction.</p>\n<p>Working with your partner, use the following Desmos activity to sort the polynomials below.

Have their partner identify which type of polynomial it is and its degree.</p>\n<p>Explain that identifying the type of polynomial and its degree will be important for determining how to perform different operations on them.</p>"
