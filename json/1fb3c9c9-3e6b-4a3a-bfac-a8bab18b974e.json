The first day it only grows by 1 square millimeter, while on the fifth day it grows by 32 square millimeters.\n    </li>\n<li> How could the average rate of change be more accurate? <br>\n<br>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> The domain used to find the average rate of change could be smaller. The average rate of change of different intervals could be compared.\n    </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>\n<h5>More Chances</h5>\n<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>"
