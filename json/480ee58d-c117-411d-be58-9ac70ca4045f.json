Students will determine how many solutions a function has based on an understanding of its factored form. They will also be able to explain the characteristics of the graph of a quadratic function with no solution.</p>\n<p>In the second activity, students work in pairs to fluently rewrite quadratic expressions in factored and standard form using the strategies learned in the unit.</p>\n<p>In the third activity, students find the specific equation in standard form of a quadratic function that has certain zeros and passes through a particular point, given a real-world situation. They will use the equation to make a prediction about the situation, given the context of the problem.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Explain why quadratic equations can have no solutions and explain why there are none. </li>\n  <li> Recognize that the number of solutions to a quadratic equation can be revealed when the equation is written as an expression in factored form equal to zero. </li>\n  <li> Write an equivalent expression in factored form given a quadratic expression of the form \\(ax^2+ bx + c\\), where \\(a\\) is not 1. </li>\n  <li> Use the intercept form of a quadratic function, \\(f(x) = a(x &minus; p)(x &minus; q)\\), to define a specific function given its zeros and a point. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Explain why quadratic equations can have no solutions and explain why there are none. </li>\n  <li> Recognize quadratic equations that have zero, one, or two solutions when they are written in factored form. </li>\n  <li> Write equivalent expressions in factored form when given quadratic expressions of the form \\(ax^2+ bx + c\\) and \\(a\\) is not 1. </li>\n  <li> Use the intercept form of a quadratic function to define a specific function given its zeros and a point. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> A8(A) solve quadratic equations having real solutions by factoring, taking square roots, completing the square, and applying the quadratic formula. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4> Required Materials</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Pencil and paper </li>\n  <li> <a href=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/8fcd6a8b33a8ac7c0566f4152c80ee50b1a9b673\" target=\"_blank\">Project 8 Handout</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Print one set of tables, found in the Project 8 Handout, for each pair of students in class. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Project Activities</h4>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Activity P8.1: Relating the Graphs of Quadratic Equations to Their Factored Form by Their Zeros </li>\n  <li> Activity P8.2: Converting Between Factored Form and Standard Form </li>\n  <li> Activity P8.3: Modeling Rocket Flight Using a Quadratic Equation </li>\n</ul>"
