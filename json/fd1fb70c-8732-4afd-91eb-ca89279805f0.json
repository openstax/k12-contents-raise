Here, they learn to use that skill to solve quadratic equations.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Consider keeping students in groups of two.</p>\n<p>Display for all to see the two solution methods in the activity statement. Ask students if the quadratic expression in the original equation is a perfect square. Then, ask them to study the methods and make sense of the steps. Afterward, discuss with students:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> \"How are the two solution methods alike?\" (They both involve making the expression on the left a perfect square. They are the steps for solving the same equation, so the solutions are the same.) </li>\n  <li> \"How are they different?\" (In the first solution, Diego first subtracted 9 from each side, and then added 25 to complete the square. In the second, Mai added 16 to 9 because that is what is needed to make 25.) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tell students that either method works, but some people prefer the first approach because moving the original constant term to the other side of the equal sign (the right side, in this case) allows them to see what constant term is needed to make a perfect square on the left side. They also find it to be less prone to errors.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>One technique for solving quadratic equations is called completing the square. Here are two examples of how Diego and Mai completed the square to solve the same equation.</p>\n<p>Diego:</p>\n<p>\\(\\begin{aligned} x^{2}+10 x+9 &amp;=0 \\\\ x^{2}+10 x &amp;=-9 \\\\ x^{2}+10 x+25 &amp;=-9+25 \\\\ x^{2}+10 x+25 &amp;=16 \\\\ (x+5)^{2} &amp;=16 \\\\ \\sqrt{(x+5)^{2}} &amp;=\\sqrt{16} \\\\ x+5 &amp;=\\pm \\;4 \\\\ \\\\ x+5=4 \\text { or } x+5 &amp;=-4 \\\\ x=-1 \\text { and } x=-9 &amp; \\end{aligned}\\)</p>\n<br>\n<p>Mai:</p>\n<p>\\(\\begin{aligned} x^{2}+10 x+9 &amp;=0 \\\\ x^{2}+10 x+9+16 &amp;=16 \\\\ x^{2}+10 x+25 &amp;=16 \\\\ (x+5)^{2} &amp;=16 \\\\ \\sqrt{(x+5)^{2}} &amp;=\\sqrt{16} \\\\ (x+5) &amp;=\\pm \\;4 \\\\ \\\\ x+5=4 \\text { and } x+5=-4 \\\\ x=-1 \\text { or } x=-9 \\end{aligned} \\)</p><br>\n<p>Study the worked examples.

Encourage students to explain how they used the worked solutions to help solve the equations on their own. After each student presents, ask if others found the same solution but completed the square in a different way. Make sure students see that the steps could vary, but the solutions should be the same if equality between the two sides of the equal sign is maintained throughout the solving process.</p>\n<p>Ask students how they could check their solutions. One way is by substituting the solutions back into the equation and seeing if the equation is true at those values of the variable. For example, to see if -4 and -2 are the right solutions to the equation \\(x^2+6x+8=0\\), we can evaluate \\((-4)^2+6(-4)+8\\) and \\((-2)^2+6(-2)+8\\) and see if each has a value of 0. Both \\(16&minus;24+8\\) and \\(4&minus;12+8\\) give 0, so the solutions are correct.</p>\n<p>For students who need more scaffolding, print out the worked solutions and have students label the steps. They can then use these steps to help them solve questions 1&ndash;5. Students may also benefit from working so that each partner takes a turn doing one step in the process.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>9.2.3: Self Check&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>\n        <p>Find the solutions to \\(x^2-10x=-9\\) by completing the square.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x=25\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incorrect.
