      "html": "<p>In this lesson, you will review exponent properties when dividing by monomials. You will also learn multiple methods to divide a polynomial by a binomial. You will master a method to determine the remainder of a division problem involving polynomials, as well as a method to determine if a binomial is a factor of a larger polynomial. You will also gain fluency in dividing polynomials as functions.</p>\n<p>Polynomials are frequently used in calculating physics problems and other real-world situations involving projectiles and the motion of objects. Mastering the polynomial operations in this unit will help you in future studies.</p>\n<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Divide monomials. </li>\n  <li> Divide a polynomial by a monomial. </li>\n  <li> Divide polynomials using long division. </li>\n  <li> Divide polynomials using synthetic division. </li>\n  <li> Divide polynomial functions. </li>\n  <li> Use the Remainder and Factor Theorems. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 6.3.1: Dividing by Monomials </li>\n  <li> 6.3.2: Dividing Polynomials Using Long Division\n    <ul>\n      <li> 6.3.2: Self Check </li>\n      <li>6.3.2: Additional Resources</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li> 6.3.3: Dividing Polynomials Using Synthetic Division\n    <ul>\n      <li> 6.3.3: Self Check </li>\n      <li>6.3.3: Additional Resources</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li> 6.3.4: Dividing Polynomial Functions and the Remainder Theorem\n    <ul>\n      <li> 6.3.4: Self Check </li>\n      <li>6.3.4: Additional Resources</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li> 6.3.5: Using the Factor Theorem </li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll<strong> practice and review</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 6.3.6: Practice </li>\n  <li> 6.3.7: Lesson Summary </li>\n</ul>"
