Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</span>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"student-summary\">\n      <div class=\"body\">\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>"
