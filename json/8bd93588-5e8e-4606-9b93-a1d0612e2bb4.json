Students will model the data set representing the flight of a helium balloon by creating a scatter plot, find the equation of a curve of best fit, and use that equation to make predictions about the balloon&rsquo;s flight.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in pairs or groups, if necessary, so they have access to Desmos. If possible, allow students to work individually so that each understands the steps necessary to make predictions using a curve of best fit.</p>\n<p>This activity starts from the beginning in Desmos, allowing students to create a table and then populate it with the data set representing the balloon&rsquo;s flight. Gauge students&rsquo; comfort with entering the data set and finding the curve of best fit. Review the steps as needed while allowing students to complete the first two questions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pause the class and be sure that students have correctly entered the data and generated a curve of best fit before moving to question 3.</p>\n<p>Allow students quiet time to think individually as they attempt question 3. Reinforce the idea that they can enter the equation \\(x = 4\\) into Desmos to help them solve the problem. After discussing the solution to question 3 as a class, allow students time to complete the remaining questions.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>A helium balloon is released and floats up before coming back down to the ground.</p>\n<p>The following data set shows the height in feet, \\(y\\), of the balloon corresponding to the number of minutes passed, \\(x\\).</p>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"131\">\n    <col width=\"178\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>\\(x_1\\) (minutes)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>\\(y_1\\) (height in feet)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>1</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>99.7</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>1.5</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>130</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>3</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>149</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>4.5</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>172</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>7</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>108</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>9</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <p>84</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>Click the + symbol in the top left and select a table.
