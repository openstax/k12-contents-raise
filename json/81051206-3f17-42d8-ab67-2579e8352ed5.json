In this lesson, they transition to linear inequalities in two variables.</p>\n<p>Previously, students learned that the solutions to an equation in two variables are all pairs of values that make the equation true, and that, when graphed, the solutions are points on a line. Here, they learn that the solutions to inequalities in two variables also involve pairs of values. When graphed, the solutions are no longer points on a single line, but comprise a region that is bounded by a line. This region consists of all points in a plane on one side of a boundary line. That boundary line is the graph of an equation related to the inequality.</p>\n<p>Students begin by noticing that the plots of solutions and non-solutions occupy different parts of a coordinate plane. Next, they think about the boundary line between the two regions and whether it is a part of the solution. Finally, students write some inequalities given graphs that represent solution regions.</p>\n<h3>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h3>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Determine the solution region to an inequality in two variables by testing the points on the line and on either side of the line, given the graph of a related equation.</span><br></li>\n<li>Explain that the solutions to a linear inequality in two variables are represented graphically as a half-plane bounded by a line.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Determine which side of the line the solutions to the inequality will fall, given a two-variable inequality and the graph of the related equation.</span><br></li>\n<li>Describe the graph that represents the solutions to a linear inequality in two variables.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h3>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>TEKS</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A3(D) graph the solution set of linear inequalities in two variables on the coordinate plane;<br></td>\n<td>Foundational: Lesson provides foundational content necessary for students to be able to perform this TEKS in later lessons.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<h3>Lesson Activities</h3>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2.10.1: Using Computation and Reasoning</li>\n<li>2.10.2: Finding Solutions to Inequalities on the Coordinate Plane<ul>\n<li>2.10.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>2.10.2: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>2.10.3: Sketching Solutions to Inequalities<ul>\n<li>2.10.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li>2.10.3: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>2.10.4: Shading Boundary Line Regions</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div><span>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 2.10.5: Practice.</span></div>\n<div><br>\n<h3>Required Materials</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Colored pencils</li>\n<li>Optional: graphing calculator</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Required Preparation</h3>\n<p>The colored pencils are optional. If used in the first activity, each student needs 2 different colors. As an alternative to 2 colors, students could just write two different symbols.<br></p>\n<h3>Lesson Vocabulary</h3>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson. Encourage students to look for these words and notice their use and meanings.</li>\n<li>Encourage students to use key vocabulary words in &ldquo;math talk&rdquo; and their written and oral explanations.</li>\n<li>Utilize a word wall. Sample cards are located here: <a href=\"https://www.doe.virginia.gov/instruction/mathematics/resources/vocab_cards/\" target=\"_blank\">Mathematics Vocabulary Word Wall Cards</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Vocabulary words that are emphasized in this lesson include:</p>\n<p><strong>Previous Vocabulary:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>inequality</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>New Vocabulary:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>linear inequality</li>\n<li>solution to a linear inequality</li>\n<li>boundary line</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Support for Building Character</h3>\n<p>Throughout this unit, find ways to encourage and support students to work on cultivating their <strong>growth mindset.</strong></p>\n<p>Here are some tips to try during this lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://characterlab.org/tips-of-the-week/can-i-or-cant-i/\" target=\"_blank\">Can I or Can&rsquo;t I?</a></li>\n<li><span><a href=\"https://characterlab.org/tips-of-the-week/cultivating-confidence/\" target=\"_blank\">Cultivating Confidence</a></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find other tips located here in the <a href=\"https://characterlab.org/playbooks/growth-mindset/\" target=\"_blank\">Playbook on Growth Mindset</a> from Character Lab.</p>\n</div>"
