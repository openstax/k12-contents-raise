You substituted a value in for \\(x\\) to determine whether the equation was true. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 8.9.2: Using Factored Form and the Zero Product Property to Solve Quadratic Equations </li>\n  <ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n    <li> In this activity, you practiced setting an equation equal to 0 before finding its factored form. Then you used the zero product property on the factored form to solve the quadratic equation. </li>\n    <li> 8.9.2: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 8.9.2: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 8.9.3: Writing an Equation to Represent a Quadratic Function with Only One Solution </li>\n  <ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n    <li> In this activity, you learned the relationship between the number of solutions found in the factored form of a quadratic function and the number of zeros on the graph of the same quadratic function. You used this relationship to make predictions about the quadratic function. </li>\n    <li> 8.9.3: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 8.9.3: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 8.9.4: Solving More Quadratic Equations </li>\n  <ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n    <li> In this activity, you continued to practice solving quadratic equations as you became more familiar with their factored form and the zero product property. </li>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> 8.9.5: Practice </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <!--pulldown-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n      <p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n      <p>Correct!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n      <p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!--Do not edit below line.-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n</div>"
