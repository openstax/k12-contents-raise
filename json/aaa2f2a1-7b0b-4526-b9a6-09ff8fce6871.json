These understandings help students develop fluency and will be helpful later in this lesson when students will need to use similar computations to solve quadratic equations.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Display one problem at a time. Give students quiet think time for each problem and ask them to give a signal when they have an answer and a strategy. Keep all problems displayed throughout the talk. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>Solve each equation mentally.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>\\(x+x=\\frac14\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(x=\\frac18\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n  <li>\\((\\frac{3}{2})^2=x\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(x=\\frac94\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\">\n  <li>\\(\\frac{3}{5}+x=\\frac95\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(x=\\frac65\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"4\">\n  <li>\\(\\frac{1}{12}+x=\\frac14\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Write down your answer in simplest form, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(x=\\frac16\\)</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Ask students to share their strategies for each problem. Record and display their responses for all to see. To involve more students in the conversation, consider asking:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> \"Who can restate __________'s reasoning in a different way?\" </li>\n  <li> \"Did anyone have the same strategy but would explain it differently?\" </li>\n  <li> \"Did anyone solve the problem in a different way?\" </li>\n  <li> \"Does anyone want to add on to __________'s strategy?\" </li>\n  <li> \"Do you agree or disagree? Why?\" </li>\n</ul>"
