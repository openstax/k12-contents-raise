This warm-up prompts students to think about how they could go about analyzing the values in the table and to articulate their reasoning.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<div>\n<h3><span>Launch</span></h3>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Display the table for all to see. Explain that the quantities in each column are related.</p>\n<p>Ask groups to try to find a relationship and pay attention to how they go about doing so. Emphasize that the goal is <em>not</em> to successfully find a relationship. It is to notice the strategies they use when attempting to figure out what the relationship might be.</p>\n<div>\n<h3><span>Student-Facing Statement</span></h3>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Here is a table of values.

Others may notice that the \\(y \\)-values are 1 less than the square numbers 1, 4, 9, 25, and 49, and that these numbers are the squares of the listed \\( x\\)-values, and from there concluded that the relationship is along the lines of: &ldquo;square \\( x\\) and subtract 1 to get \\(y \\).&rdquo; Neither of these observations is essential, but consider asking if they see any special patterns in either column that could help determine the relationship.</p>\n<p>If no one mentions plotting the pairs of values as a way to understand the relationship between \\( x\\) and \\( y\\), and if time permits, consider displaying a graph such as the one shown (or displaying a blank coordinate plane and plotting the points together).</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"A scatter plot with plotted points (1, 0), (3, 8), (5, 24), and (7, 48).\" class=\"img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom\" height=\"222\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/46a63ce8c51d3b6a788e6e015b8defeef1c0a2a9\" width=\"232\"></strong><br></p>\n<p>Ask students to keep in mind the different strategies as they work on the activities in the lesson.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"main\">\n<div class=\"activities\">\n<div class=\"body\">\n<ol>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"student-summary\">\n<div class=\"body\">\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"
