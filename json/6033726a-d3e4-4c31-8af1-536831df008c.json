The members of the choir decided to order from a printing company that charges $3 per shirt, plus a $50 fee for each color to be printed on the shirts.</p>\n<p></p><span>1. Write an equation that represents the relationship between the number of T-shirts ordered, the number of colors on the shirts, and the total cost of the order. If you use a </span><strong>variable</strong><span>, specify what it represents.</span><br>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-content\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-prompt\">\n    <p>Write your answers here:</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-ack\">\n    <p>Check your work:</p>\n    <p><span>\\( 75 \\cdot 3 + 50\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc37 \\)&nbsp;(or equivalent)&nbsp;</span><br></p>\n    <p>\\( \ud835\udc65 \\)&nbsp;represents the number of colors on the shirts.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>\\( D \\)&nbsp;represents the total cost in dollars.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<br>\n<p>2.
