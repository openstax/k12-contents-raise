If we rewrite it as a table, we can work backward to understand how \\(2^0\\) and \\(5^0\\) are both 1.</p>\n<p>Using \\(y=2^x\\) and filling in the parts we have found results in Table 1:</p>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>\\(x\\)</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>0</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>1</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>2</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>3</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>\\(y\\)</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>&nbsp;</td>\n      <td>\n        <p>2</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>4</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>8</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p>Repeating that process for \\(y=5^x\\) results in Table 2:</p>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>\\(x\\)</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>0</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>1</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>2</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>3</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>\\(y\\)</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>&nbsp;</td>\n      <td>\n        <p>5</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>25</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>125</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p>Since exponents represent repeated multiplication in both tables, additional terms are found by multiplying again by the base. What if we worked backward? If you multiply to move to the right in the table, you can divide by the common ratio to work backward. Start with the 8, and work backward to fill in the table:</p>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>\\(x\\)</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>0</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>1</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>2</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>3</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>\\(y\\)</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(2\\div2=1\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(4\\div2=2\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(8\\div2=4\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>8</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p>Repeat the process for Table 2:</p>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>\\(x\\)</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>0</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>1</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>2</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>3</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>\\(y\\)</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(5\\div5=1\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(25\\div5=5\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(125\\div5=25\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>125</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p>After you have worked backward in each table, you will see that \\(2^0\\) and \\(5^0\\) both equal 1. When 1 is the exponent, your answer is the same as the common ratio, so when you divide by the common ratio, you end up with 1 as your answer every time. This is an important rule that can save a lot of time.</p>\n<h4>Try It: Zero as an Exponent</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"Reveal1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-content\">\n    <p>Find the value of each of the following:</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-prompt\">\n    <ol>\n      <li> \\(3^0\\) </li>\n      <li> \\(1,246^0\\)</li>\n      <li>\\(\n        \\left(2\\cdot3\\cdot7\\right)^0\\)</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>Write down your answer.
