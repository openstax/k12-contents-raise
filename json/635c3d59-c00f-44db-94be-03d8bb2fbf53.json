Each time, the owner returned within minutes.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Dog with leash tied to a post.\" height=\"269\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/9a5d6fa9e01c7f7cf997ea941c0a1d3244058568\" width=\"300\"></p>\n<p>The dog&rsquo;s movement each day is described here.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Day 1: The dog walked around the entire time while waiting for its owner.</li>\n  <li>Day 2: The dog walked around for the first minute and then laid down until its owner returned.</li>\n  <li>Day 3: The dog tried to follow its owner into the store but was stopped by the leash. Then, it started walking around the post in one direction. It kept walking until its leash was completely wound up around the post. The dog stayed there until its owner returned.</li>\n  <li>Each day, the dog was 1.5 feet away from the post when the owner left.</li>\n  <li>Each day, 60 seconds after the owner left, the dog was 4 feet from the post.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your teacher will assign one of the days for you to analyze. You will sketch a graph that could represent the dog&rsquo;s distance from the post, in feet, as a function of time, in seconds, since the owner left.</p>\n<p>Then, meet with someone in your group who had Day 2&rsquo;s movement and someone who had Day 3&rsquo;s movement. Work together to explain your graphs and make changes where needed before checking your work.
