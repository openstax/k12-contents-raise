The initial balances are chosen so that the two options stay pretty close for small values of time. The intersection of their graphs is far enough from 0 that it is not easily noticed with only a few calculations. The graph for simple interest is linear. The graph for compound interest is exponential, but it is relatively flat for small values of time. As the domain values increase, students may notice that the values of the two options get closer and closer, or they may notice from the graph that the gap between the two graphs gets smaller.</p>\n<p>Look for students who make different choices for the investment option because the better option would depend on the length of investment, which is unspecified. As in the case of the genies&rsquo; offers in the opening lesson, simple interest is better if the investment term is short, but compound interest becomes increasingly more favorable as time passes. Some students may not recognize this until they graph the two functions in the last question. Identify students who decide to change their earlier choice and can defend the change. Ask them to share later.</p>\n<h4> Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Encourage students to think quietly about the questions before conferring with their partner. Provide access to graphing technology.</p>\n<h5>Support for English Language Learners</h5>\n<div>\n  <p> Use this routine to support reading comprehension of this word problem. Use the first read to orient students to the situation. Ask students to describe what the situation is about without using numbers (a family is choosing between investing money with simple or compound interest). Use the second read to identify quantities and relationships. Ask students what can be counted or measured without focusing on the values. Listen for, and amplify, the important quantities that vary in relation to each other in this situation: years of investment and amount of money. After the third read, ask students to brainstorm possible strategies to answer the questions. This helps students connect the language in the word problem and the reasoning needed to solve the problem.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h5>Support for Students with Disabilities</h5>\n<div>\n  <p>Begin the activity with concrete or familiar contexts. Activate background knowledge by asking students to recall what they know about simple interest, compound interest, and savings accounts.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>A family has $1,000 to invest and is considering two options: investing in government bonds that offer 2% simple interest, or investing in a savings account at a bank, which charges a $20 fee to open an account and pays 2% compound interest. Both options pay interest annually.</p>\n<p>Here are two tables showing what they would earn in the first couple of years if they do not invest additional amounts or withdraw any money.</p>\n<p>Bonds</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"163\">\n    <col width=\"148\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>years of investment</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>amount in dollars</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>0</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>$1,000</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>1</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>$1,020</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>2</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>$1,040</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p>Savings Account</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"163\">\n    <col width=\"148\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>years of investment</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>amount in dollars</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>0</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>$980</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>1</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>$999.60</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>2</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>$1,019.59</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Bonds: How does the investment grow with simple interest? <br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> The investment grows linearly.

Ask them to think about what might make sense for their own family or to give circumstances that would justify a choice.</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Consider surveying the class to see the choices students made. Select students who made different choices to explain their responses, starting with those who opted for the bonds. Display their reasoning and graphs for all to see. If no students consider a time frame beyond 8 or 9 years, ask students which option would be better if the money could be left alone for 20 years. Discuss questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>&ldquo;How does the fee for the savings account affect the function?&rdquo; (It reduces the account balance, at the beginning, by $20. In the equation, there is a subtraction of 20.) </li>\n  <li>&ldquo;Where can we see the fees on the graph?&rdquo; (The vertical intercept of the graph for the savings account is at 980, which is 20 less than 1,000.) </li>\n  <li>&ldquo;When might the bonds be the better investment, if ever?&rdquo; (When the investment is shorter than a decade because that is when the savings account surpasses it.) </li>\n  <li>&ldquo;When might the savings account be the better investment, if ever?&rdquo; (When it is left for more than 10 years, after the compounding effects of interest make up for the initial fees.) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Point out that the exponential function here (the balance of the savings account) has a relatively slow rate of growth. It takes it a relatively long time before it overtakes the linear function, but it eventually does.</p>\n<h4>Video: Using Tables to Compare Linear and Exponential Functions</h4>\n<p>Watch the following video to learn more about comparing linear and exponential functions:</p>\n<video controls=\"true\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" width=\"550\">\n  <source src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b2c38efd9bdabdfa5993319c5eb1d37b24042ed2\">\n  <track default=\"true\" kind=\"captions\" label=\"On\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/cde8cdd3b62ea446c6bfc2f233327ae95b83d98f\" srclang=\"en_us\">https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b2c38efd9bdabdfa5993319c5eb1d37b24042ed2\n</video>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h3>5.14.2: Self Check&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION: </strong></p>\n        <p>Using a calculator, Joanna made the following table and then made the following conjecture: \\(3x\\) is always greater than \\((1.02)^x\\).

Then select the <strong>solution </strong>button to compare your work.</p>\n<h5>Solution</h5>\n<p> Here is how to determine which table is exponential growth:</p>\n<p>When looking for exponential growth, remember that each \\(y\\)-value should be greater than the previous one. By first checking for growth, you can eliminate Table B and Table D. In Table B, each term is less than the first one, so it is not exponential growth. In Table D, the values increase and decrease, so it is not exponential growth, either.</p>\n<p>Next, check for connections between consecutive terms. In Table A, \\(2+6= 8\\) and \\(2 \\cdot 4=8\\). Since there seems to be the possibility of either a linear relationship or exponential growth, you need to check the next set of terms. Since \\(8 \\cdot 4 \\neq 14\\) and \\(8+6 =14\\), the relationship in Table A is linear, not exponential.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This means the answer should be Table C, but we should always check to confirm. If we check consecutive terms in Table C for a growth factor, we get the following: \\(\\frac {16}{4}=4\\), \\(\\frac{64}{16}=4\\), and \\(\\frac{256}{64}=4\\). This proves that the growth factor is 4 and Table C represents exponential growth.</p>"
