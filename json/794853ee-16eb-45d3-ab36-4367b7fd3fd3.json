We will begin by studying numerical examples and noticing that certain expressions are equivalent.</p>\n<p>Remember that when you want to enter a number with an exponent, use the ^ symbol. It will look like \"\\(x^2\\)\" when you want to enter \\(x^2\\). To make the ^ symbol, push shift and the numeral 6 at the same time.</p>\n<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> Explain why multiplying binomials that are a sum and a difference, \\((x + m)(x &minus; m)\\), results in a quadratic expression with no linear term. </li>\n<li> Rewrite a quadratic expression of the form \\(x^2&minus;c\\) into its factored form. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are the <strong>activities</strong> that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> 8.8.1: Evaluating Expressions Using Mental Math </li>\n<li> 8.8.2: Recognizing the Expanded Product of the Difference of Two Squares </li>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> 8.8.2: Self Check </li>\n<li> 8.8.2: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 8.8.3: Factoring Quadratic Equations Without a Linear Term </li>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> 8.8.3: Self Check </li>\n<li> 8.8.3: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 8.8.4: Determining if an Expression Can Be Rewritten in Factored Form </li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that, you'll <strong>practice and review</strong>.</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n<li> 8.8.5: Practice </li>\n<li> 8.8.6: Lesson Summary </li>\n</ul>"
