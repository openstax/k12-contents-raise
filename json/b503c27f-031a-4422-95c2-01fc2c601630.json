I graphed it, and it doesn&rsquo;t look geometric.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Do you agree with Jada or Mai? Explain your reasoning using a graph.</p>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<p>Sample response: I agree with Mai. Jada noticed that each value is multiplied by 3 to get to the next row, but the table skips terms. If the sequence were geometric, it would have to be 2, 6, 18, 54, 108. When Mai made a graph, she could see the gap in the sequence.</p>\n<p><img alt class=\"img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom\" height=\"186\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/3bba1ca82b4ae12d103f6f2c896886d49404b31d\" width=\"201\"></p>\n<p>Without knowing the missing terms, we don&rsquo;t know for sure if the sequence is arithmetic, but it could be since the three given points are all on the same line with slope 4. The missing points could be \\((3,10)\\) and \\((4,14)\\) so that the sequence would be 2, 6, 10, 14, 18.</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Invite previously selected students to share their reasoning, displaying any graphs created for all to see. If the idea of slope or average rate of change does not come up, ask students how they could have found the missing points for an arithmetic sequence just given \\((2,6)\\) and \\((5,18)\\). Draw in the slope triangle and show the computation for the average rate of change.</p>\n<h3>4.15.3: Self Check</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<colgroup>\n<col>\n<col>\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">\n<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>\n<p>Which two terms could be next in the sequence to make it arithmetic?</p>\n<p>5, 8, ____, ____</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>12.8, 7.68</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: These would be the next two terms if the sequence were geometric. The answer is 11, 14.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>11, 14</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>That&rsquo;s correct! Check yourself: The common difference from 5 to 8 is 3, so continue to add 3 to find the next two terms.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>13, 20</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: This is the result of adding 3, then 5, and then 7. The common difference remains the same in an arithmetic sequence. The answer is 11, 14.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>13, 21</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Incorrect. Let&rsquo;s try again a different way: This is the result of adding the two previous terms. This sequence does not have a common difference.
