Remember that the residual for a point in the scatter plot is the vertical distance of that point from the line of best fit.

The scatter plot and line of best fit are shown below.<br></p>\n<p><img alt=\"A SCATTER PLOT THAT SHOWS CURB WEIGHT IN HUNDREDS OF POUNDS ON THE X-AXIS AND FUEL EFFICIENCY IN MILES PER GALLON ON THE Y-AXIS.

This means that the points in the residual plot will be below the horizontal axis, then above it, and then below it again.&nbsp;</span><br></p>\n  <p><span>The residual plot has an arch shape like this:</span><br></p>\n  <p><img alt=\"A RESIDUAL PLOT THAT SHOWS FROM LEFT TO RIGHT POINTS BELOW THE HORIZONTAL AXIS, ABOVE THE HORIZONTAL AXIS, AND THEN BELOW THE HORIZONTAL AXIS.\n\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b41bf70fcf1fec0b55323d9f0376930008f37343\" width=\"450\"><br></p>\n  <p>How did you do?
