Each small photo she displays costs her $4 and each large photo costs her $10. She doesn&rsquo;t want to spend more than $200 on photos to display.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let x be the number of small photos and y be the number of large photos that Anika displays.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We know that each small photo costs $4 to display and each large photo costs $10.

Another way to verify this is by using the inequality.&nbsp;</p><p>\\( \\begin{eqnarray} 4x + 10y &le; 200 \\\\ 4(15) + 10(15) \\leq 200 \\\\60 + 150 \\leq 200\\\\210 \\nleq 200 \\end{eqnarray} \\)<br></p><p>Since $210 is not less than $200, 15 small paintings and 15 large paintings does not stay with Anika&rsquo;s budget of $200.</p><br><p>How did you do? Know that you learn more from wrong answers than from right answers! Wrong answers help us find flaws in our thinking. Take a minute to think about&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;you got the question wrong. Then you won&rsquo;t get this type of question wrong again!</p><p></p>\n</div>"
