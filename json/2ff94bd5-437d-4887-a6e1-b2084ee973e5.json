Use the answers from the activity.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<colgroup>\n<col>\n<col>\n<col>\n<col>\n<col>\n<col>\n<col>\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><p>Number of Discs</p></td>\n<td><p>3</p></td>\n<td><p>4</p></td>\n<td><p>5</p></td>\n<td><p>6</p></td>\n<td><p>7</p></td>\n<td><p>8</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><p>Number of Moves to Solve Puzzle</p></td>\n<td><p>7</p></td>\n<td><p>15</p></td>\n<td><p>31</p></td>\n<td><p>?</p></td>\n<td><p>127</p></td>\n<td><p>?</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p>The pattern was to double the previous answer and then add 1.</p>\n<p>Using this pattern, complete the table for 6 discs.</p>\n<p>\\(2(31)+1=63\\)</p>\n<p>Then use this rule to find how many moves are needed to complete the puzzle with 8 discs.</p>\n<p>There were 127 moves for 7 discs.</p>\n<p>So, double 127 and add 1: \\(2(127)+1=255\\).</p>\n<h4>Try It: Using a Table to Find the Pattern</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"Reveal1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-content\">\n<p>Now it&rsquo;s your turn. For the same game, how many moves would it take to solve the puzzle with 9 discs?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-prompt\">\n<p>In your notebook, write down your answer. Then select the <strong>Solution</strong> button to check your work. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-content\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\" data-wait-for-event=\"Reveal1\">\n<p>Your answers may vary, but here are some examples:</p>\n<p>The pattern is still the same. Double the number of moves before and add 1.</p>\n<p>With 8 discs, 255 moves were needed.</p>\n<p>Double 255, and then add 1:</p>\n<p>\\(2(255)+1=511\\)</p>\n<p>How did you do? Know that you learn more from wrong answers than from right answers! Wrong answers help us find flaws in our thinking. Take a minute to think about <em>why</em> you got the question wrong. Then you won&rsquo;t get this type of question wrong again!</p>\n</div>"
