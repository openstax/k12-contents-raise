It is a valid move, but because the original equation does not have a solution (5 times a number, <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 5x \\)</span>, cannot be equal to 5 times a smaller number, <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 5(x-3) \\)</span>), the second equation also does not have a solution (3 less than a number, <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( x-3 \\)</span>, cannot be equal to that number, <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( x \\)</span>).</li>\n          <li>D: The move made is dividing each side by <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( x \\)</span>. The second equation doesn&rsquo;t have a solution even though the original solution does. The move is problematic because it would eliminate the variable and make us miss the solution, namely <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( x=0 \\)</span>.</li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>"
