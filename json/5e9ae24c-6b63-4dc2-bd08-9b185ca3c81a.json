They also practice identifying equivalent quadratic expressions in standard and factored forms. Students are given a set of cards containing equations and graphs. They sort them into sets of three cards wherein each set contains two equivalent equations and a graph that all represent the same quadratic function. They also explain to a partner how they know the cards belong together. A sorting task gives students opportunities to analyze the different equations, graphs, and structures closely and make connections and to justify their decisions as they practice constructing logical arguments.</p>\n<p>Here are the equations and graphs for reference and planning:</p>\n<p>\\(y=x^2-1\\)</p>\n<p>\\(y=x^2-4x\\)</p>\n<p>\\(y=x^2-4x+4\\)</p>\n<p>\\(y=x^2-5x+4\\)</p>\n<p>\\(y=x(x-4)\\)</p>\n<p>\\(y=(x+1)(x-1)\\)</p>\n<p>\\(y=(x-1)(x-4)\\)</p>\n<p>\\(y=(x-2)^2\\)</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Card sort images.\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/6e1588238e3876c5d84a23d9d31b742b47a4d202\" width=\"624\"></p>\n<p>As students work, monitor how they go about making the matches. Some students may begin by studying features of the graph and then relate them to the equations. Others may work the other way around. Identify students with contrasting approaches so they can share in the discussion.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Give each group a set of pre-printed cards. Tell students to take turns sorting the cards into sets that represent the same quadratic function. The person whose turn it is to compile a set should explain how they know the cards belong together. (The person who has the last turn should also explain why the cards belong together, aside from the fact that they are the last remaining cards.) The partner should listen and ask for clarification or discuss any disagreement. Once all the cards are sorted, ask students to record their findings in the given graphic organizer.</p>\n<p>If time permits, before partners record anything, ask them to compare their sorted sets with another group of students and discuss any disagreements.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>Your teacher will give your group a set of cards. Each card contains a graph or an equation.</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Take turns with your partner to sort the cards into sets so that each set contains two equations and a graph that all represent the same quadratic function. </li>\n  <li> For each set of cards that you put together, explain to your partner how you know they belong together. </li>\n  <li> For each set that your partner puts together, listen carefully to their explanation. If you disagree, discuss your thinking and work to reach an agreement. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once all the cards are sorted and discussed, record the equivalent equations, sketch the corresponding graph, and write a brief note or explanation about why the representations were grouped together.</p>\n<p>Write down your answers, then select the solution button to compare your work.</p>\n<strong> </strong>\n<p><strong>Answers:</strong></p>\n<p>Set 1:&nbsp;<br>\n  Standard Form: \\(y=x^2-1\\) <br>\n  Factored Form: \\(y=(x+1)(x-1)\\)</p>\n<p><img height=\"168\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/82fc8ea2f2005ffe3659eb6903b2408f9f0900db\" width=\"264\"></p>\n<p>Set 2:<br>\n  Standard Form: \\(y=x^2-4x\\) <br>\n  Factored Form: \\(y=x(x-4)\\)</p>\n<p><img height=\"168\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/8d19fef8477df88c1a3420a749c54e64aff87df2\" width=\"264\"></p>\n<p>Set 3:<br>\n  Standard Form: \\(y=x^2-5x+4\\) <br>\n  Factored Form: \\(y=(x-1)(x-4)\\)</p>\n<p><img height=\"168\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/71dd23549243c8d7e836891aaec751799982e634\" width=\"264\"></p>\n<p>Set 4:<br>\n  Standard Form: \\(y=x^2-4x+4\\) <br>\n  Factored Form: \\(y=(x-2)^2\\)</p>\n<p><img height=\"192\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/b952e365f4dbda61bd3cbb0189fd5563b3a139b3\" width=\"264\"></p>\n<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>\n<p>Some students may think a factor such as \\((x-1)\\) relates to an \\(x\\)-intercept of \\((-1,0)\\). In earlier lessons, students learned that the zeros of the function give the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the \\(x\\)-intercepts. Show students the equations \\(x-1=0\\) and \\(x+1=0\\) and ask them to solve each equation and relate the solutions back to making the expression \\((x+1)(x-1)\\) equal 0. Some students may benefit from seeing the expression \\(x-1\\) written as \\(x+-1\\) to further emphasize that the expression takes the value 0 when \\(x\\) is the opposite. Students will continue this work when solving quadratic equations in the next unit.</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Invite students to share how they found pairs of equivalent equations and how they matched the equations to the graphs.</p>\n<p>Highlight these explanations:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> The \\(y\\)-intercept of the graph helps to find the equation in standard form (or vice versa). </li>\n  <li> The \\(x\\)-intercepts of the graph help find the equation in factored form (or vice versa). </li>\n  <li> The quadratic expression in factored form can be expanded to find the equivalent expression in standard form. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>7.12.4: Self Check&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table class=\"os-raise-standardtable\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n        <p>Examine the graph below.</p>\n        <p><img alt=\"GRAPH OF A PARABOLA THAT OPENS UPWARD WITH A Y-INTERCEPT OF NEGATIVE 2 AND X-INTERCEPTS OF NEGATIVE 2 AND 1.\" height=\"203\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/2a5ccb596e0b86a9c47f805dc960f21769cf705e\" width=\"213\"></p>\n        <p>Which function matches the graph?</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(f(x) = (x - 2)(x + 1)\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incorrect.
