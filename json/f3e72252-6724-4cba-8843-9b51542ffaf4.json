They recognized that the boundary between the two regions is the graph of an equation that is related to the inequality. Students did not, however, look closely at whether the boundary line itself is a part of the solution. That investigation is the focus of this activity.</p>\n  <p>Students reason with algebraic and graphical representations of inequalities in two directions. They first graph the solutions to given inequalities, and later write inequalities whose solutions could be represented by given graphs.</p>\n  <p>If many students get stuck on graphing or writing inequalities, consider moving fairly quickly through the activity and using the discussion questions in the Lesson Synthesis to help students gain clarity and focus.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Launch</h3>\n<div>\n  <p>Display the inequalities&nbsp;<span>\\( x \\ge y \\)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>\\( x &gt; y \\)</span>&nbsp;for all to see. Then, ask students to consider whether the following coordinate pairs are solutions to each inequality.</p>\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n    <li><span>\\( (5,4) \\)</span></li>\n    <li><span>\\( (5,4.9) \\)</span></li>\n    <li><span>\\( (5,5) \\)</span></li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>Make sure students understand why all three coordinate pairs are solutions to&nbsp;<span>\\( x \\ge y \\)</span>, but only&nbsp;<span>\\( (5,4) \\)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>\\( (5,4.9) \\)</span>&nbsp;are solutions to&nbsp;<span>\\( x &gt; y \\)</span>. Display two graphs, each representing one of these inequalities.</p>\n  <div><img alt=\"Pair of inequality graphs.\" height=\"197\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/d58d2074b2f6768d7c2a4518e293bab0610710ec\" width=\"428\"></div>\n  <p>Ask students to predict which graph represents which inequality. Consider polling the class on their predictions.</p>\n  <p>Explain that the solid line is a way to say that all the points on that line (\\( x=y \\)) are solutions, and the dashed line is a way to say otherwise. (This is similar to how we use solid and open circles to represent the boundary values of a one-variable inequality on a number line.)</p>\n  <p>Because the solutions to&nbsp;\\( x&gt;y \\)&nbsp;do not include coordinates where&nbsp;\\( x \\)&nbsp;and&nbsp;\\( y \\)&nbsp;are equal, the graph of&nbsp;\\( x=y \\)&nbsp;is drawn with a dashed line. The solutions to&nbsp;\\( x\\geq y \\)&nbsp;do include coordinates where&nbsp;\\( x \\)&nbsp;and&nbsp;\\( y \\)&nbsp;are equal, so the graph of&nbsp;\\( x=y \\)&nbsp;is drawn with a solid line.</p>\n  <p>Tell students they will now sketch the solutions of some other inequalities and think about whether or not the boundary line is included in the solutions.</p>\n  <h4>Support for Students with Disabilities</h4>\n  <div><em>Representation: Develop Language and Symbols.</em>&nbsp;Create a display of the four inequality symbols&nbsp;\\( &lt; \\),&nbsp;\\( \\leq \\),&nbsp;\\( &gt; \\), and&nbsp;\\( \\geq \\).

Suggest that they write the coordinates of several points on the line and look for a pattern. For example, some points on the vertical line are&nbsp;\\( (3,\\text-2), (3, 0), (3,4) \\), and&nbsp;\\( (3,6) \\). Noticing that the&nbsp;\\( x \\)-value is always 3, regardless of the&nbsp;\\( y \\)-value, may help remind students that the equation is&nbsp;\\( x=3 \\).</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<div>\n  <p>Select students to share their sketched graphs for the first set of questions and the inequalities they wrote for the second set of questions.
