Each graph represents a function relating time and temperature. No scales are shown on the coordinate axes, so students need to look for and make use of the structure of the graphs in determining how each one is like or unlike the others.</p>\n<p>In making comparisons, students have a reason to use language precisely, especially recently learned terms that describe features of graphs.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 2&ndash;4. Display the graphs for all to see. Give students 1 minute of quiet time to think individually and then time to share their thinking with their small group. In their small groups, ask each student to share their reasoning as to why a particular item does not belong, and together, find at least one reason each item doesn&rsquo;t belong.</p>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>\n<p>Which graph doesn&rsquo;t belong?</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" type=\"A\">\n  <li><img alt=\"A graph, origin O. Horizontal axis is labeled time. Vertical axis is labeled temperature. A horizontal line is drawn on the graph.\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/7fcc408d19ce617913af3f3a46004e8be13c59c8\"></li>\n  <li><img alt=\"A graph, origin O. Horizontal axis is labeled time. Vertical axis is labeled temperature. The curve is shaped like a U and opens downward.\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/606a0a2d55d7374fa8f1b0e9ab75c7aebf4d265a\"></li>\n  <li><img alt=\"A graph.&nbsp;\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/e156a5a2e26bfc91852646cd52127b9a70cffb28\"></li>\n  <li><img alt=\"A graph.&nbsp;\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/5e0fb5bbd55da0fe98c9b0965ec33a557b9d36d0\"></li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<p>Compare your answer:</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" type=\"A\">\n  <li>doesn&rsquo;t belong because:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n  <li>It is the only graph that has no maximum or minimum.</li>\n  <li>It is the only situation in which the temperature does not change.</li>\n</ul>\n<li>doesn&rsquo;t belong because:</li>\n<ul>\n  <li>It is the only graph that has one maximum.</li>\n  <li>It is the only graph that shows the temperature rising and then falling (but not rising again).</li>\n</ul>\n<li>doesn&rsquo;t belong because:</li>\n<ul>\n  <li>It is the only graph that has horizontal intercepts.</li>\n  <li>It is the only graph that has one minimum.</li>\n  <li>It is the only graph that shows negative output values or negative temperatures.</li>\n  <li>It is the only graph that shows temperature falling and then rising (but not falling again).</li>\n</ul>\n<li>doesn&rsquo;t belong because:</li>\n<ul>\n  <li>It is the only graph that has several maxima and minima.</li>\n  <li>It is the only graph where the temperature rises and falls several times.</li>\n  <li>This graph shows a repeating pattern.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Ask each group to share one reason why a particular item does not belong. Record and display the responses for all to see. Encourage students to use relevant mathematical vocabulary in their explanations, and ask students to explain the meaning of any terminology that they do use, such as &ldquo;intercepts,&rdquo; &ldquo;minimum,&rdquo; or &ldquo;linear functions.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>After each response, ask the class if they agree or disagree. Since there is no single correct answer to the question asking which one does not belong, attend to students&rsquo; explanations and ensure the reasons given are correct. Also, press students on unsubstantiated claims. For example, if they claim that the vertical intercept of graph C is different from all the others, ask them how they know (as none of the vertical axes have a scale).</p>"
