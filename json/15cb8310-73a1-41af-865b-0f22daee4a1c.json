He can represent the constraints with equations and then use graphs of equations to make sense of constraints and identify values that satisfy them.</p>\n<p>As you proceed through this section, you will learn to recognize moves that transform one equation into an equivalent equation. You will use these moves to manipulate equations to solve for a certain variable. You will also learn how the form and parts of a linear equation in two variables are related to the features of its graph.</p>\n<p>This section includes 6 lessons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Equivalent Equations</li>\n<li>Explaining Steps for Rewriting Equations</li>\n<li>Which Variable to Solve For? (Part1)</li>\n<li>Which Variable to Solve For? (Part 2)</li>\n<li>Connecting Equations to Graphs (Part 1)</li>\n<li>Connecting Equations to Graphs (Part 2)</li>\n</ul>"
