He can use expressions, equations, and inequalities to represent the constraints to make sure he stays in budget.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the first few lessons, you will learn how to use expressions, equations, and inequalities to represent constraints or limitations on quantities. You will see that graphs of equations can help make sense of constraints and identify values to solve them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This section includes 5 lessons:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exploring Expressions and Equations</li>\n<li>Writing Equations to Model Relationships (Part 1)</li>\n<li>Writing Equations to Model Relationships (Part 2)</li>\n<li>Equations and Their Solutions</li>\n<li>Equations and Their Graphs</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>"
