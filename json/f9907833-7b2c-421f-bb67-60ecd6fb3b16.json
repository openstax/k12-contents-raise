You then determined the domain and range when you were given more information about the graphs. </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 4.12.2: Self Check </li>\n<li> 4.12.3: Finding Domain and Range Using a Graph </li>\n<ul>\n<li> In this activity, you used a graph to determine the domain and range using maximum and minimum values. You also determined the value of the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-intercepts. </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 4.12.3: Self Check </li>\n<li> 4.12.4: Real-World Domain and Range </li>\n<ul>\n<li> In this activity, you looked at graphs representing real-world situations that were both discrete and continuous functions. You then determined the domain and range of each type of function. For continuous functions, you wrote the domain and range as inequalities. </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 4.12.4: Self Check </li>\n<li> 4.12.5: Graph of a Function and the Domain and Range Connection </li>\n<ul>\n<li> In this activity, you examined a graph and determined if a value was in the range. You then identified the range and also determined if there is a solution to the graph. </li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 4.12.6: Practice </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<!--pulldown-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n<p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<p>Correct!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!--Do not edit below line.-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n</div>"
