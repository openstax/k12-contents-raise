If not, completing these resources can help you get a better understanding of these concepts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Distinguish linear patterns from nonlinear patterns based on scatter plots.</li>\n<li>Identify positive and negative trends in a scatter plot.</li>\n<li>Interpret slopes and y-intercepts of graphs of linear equations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are struggling, be sure to reach out to your teacher for additional help. Nobody is good at problems like this the first try. Keep at it and it will get easier.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p>\n<p><br></p>"
