If not, completing these resources can help you get a better understanding of these concepts:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Simplify radicals. </li>\n  <li> Factor perfect square trinomials. </li>\n  <li> Use vertex form to name the transformations made to \\(y=x^2\\). </li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are still struggling, be sure to reach out to your teacher for additional help. Nobody is good at problems like this the first try. Keep at it and it will get easier.</p>"
