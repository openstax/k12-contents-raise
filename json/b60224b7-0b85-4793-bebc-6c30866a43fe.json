Mr. Das is studying methods of producing stronger batteries with longer life. He can use functions to study the energy inputs and outputs.</p>\n<p>In this section, you will learn that a sequence is a type of function in which the input variable is the position (always an integer), and the output variable is the term in that position. You will learn how to write sequences using function notation and how to find the value of the nth term.</p>\n<p>This section includes 5 lessons:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    4.13 Sequences</li>\n  <li>\n    4.14 Introducing Geometric Sequences\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    4.15 Different Types of Sequences\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    4.16 Sequences Are Functions\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    4.17 The nth Term of an Arithmetic Sequence</li>\n</ul>"
