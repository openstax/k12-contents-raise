In this activity, they begin to explore average rates of change in an exponential growth function. In particular, the focus for this activity is on how exponential functions have different rates of change for different input intervals, which was not the case for linear functions.</p>\n<p>In the next activity, they investigate average rates of growth in a decay function. In both cases, they revisit contexts from earlier lessons.</p>\n<h4> Student Activity</h4>\n<p>Here is a table and a graph that show the number of coffee shops worldwide that a company had in its first 10 years, between 1987 and 1997.

The average rate of change of the 10-year period is almost 7 times greater than that of the first 3 years and more than 3 times greater than the first 6 years.

This is 60 times greater than the average rate of change over the first 3 years and almost 10 times greater than the average rate of change over the first 10 years of the time period. The number of stores continued to grow at an increasing rate from 1997 to 2007.\n</ol>\n<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>\n<p>If students struggle with a rate of change that is not constant like the slope they saw in linear relationships, ask if they can draw a straight line connecting all the points on the graph in question 3. Spend time on the graph in the synthesis so the lines can help them see why the rate of change varies with an exponential function.</p>\n<h4> Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>For the third question, make sure students see that when they calculated the average rate of change for each of the three time periods, they were in effect finding the slope of the line that goes through two points that represent the starting year and the ending year. Display a graph like the one shown here to help illustrate this point:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"11 points on coordinate plane. Lines connect first point to fourth, seventh, and eleventh points. Horizontal axis from 0 to 10, time in years. Vertical axis from 0 to 1500, number of coffee shops.\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/69e0f30cf89cfc35f420c63da1e7be40107ad268\"></p>\n<p>The line that connects the points for 1987 and 1990 fits the data for that period fairly well, so the slope of that line (the average rate of change between those two points) describes the growth in those three years fairly accurately. In contrast, the line that connects the points for 1987 and 1997 does not at all fit the data, so the slope of that line does not paint an accurate picture of how the company was growing that decade.</p>\n<p>Here are some questions for discussion:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>&ldquo;Would the average rate of change between 1994 and 1997 accurately depict how the company was growing in the last three years in the data?&rdquo; (Yes, because the average rate of change from 1994 to 1997 is 329 shops per year since \\(\\frac{1412&minus;425}{10&minus;7}=329\\). The actual number of shops increased by 252, 338, and then 397 from 1994 to 1997, respectively.) </li>\n  <li>&ldquo;Is there a single period of time where the average rate of change would accurately summarize how the company was growing from 1987 to 1997?&rdquo; (No, since the number of shops is increasing at an increasing rate, an average of two values is not enough to summarize the growth of the company.) </li>\n</ol>\n<h5> Support for English Language Learners</h5>\n<div>\n  <p>Use this routine to amplify mathematical uses of language to communicate how the rate of change differs during each specified time period. Encourage students to demonstrate mathematical thinking and problem solving by referencing two points on the graph in their explanation. Press for further detail by asking, &ldquo;How can you use the graph to determine which time period is represented best by the rate of change?&rdquo; This will help students understand how the rate of change differs in exponential functions through a whole-class discussion.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h4> Video: Analyzing Average Rate of Change of an Exponential Function</h4>\n<p>Watch the following video to learn more about the average rate of change of exponential functions:</p>\n<video controls=\"true\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" width=\"550\">\n  <source src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/f012f2931d956078be6f22f90b24f63f50921333\">\n  <track default=\"true\" kind=\"captions\" label=\"On\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/f92dfb251ff3725fb06898b80dae14782cba7df4\" srclang=\"en_us\">https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/f012f2931d956078be6f22f90b24f63f50921333\n</video>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h3>5.10.2: Self Check&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION: </strong></p>\n        <p>Suppose a population of cells starts at 500 and triples every day.
