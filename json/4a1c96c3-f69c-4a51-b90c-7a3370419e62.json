While students are not explicitly asked to find the area of geometric patterns in this lesson, the expressions that they write for the number of small squares in the patterns are effectively formulas for area (in terms of the number of small squares).</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of two. Ask both partners in each group to write the area expressions for Figure A, complete the first column of the table, and discuss their responses. Then, ask one partner to write the expressions for Figure B and the other partner to write the expressions for Figure C.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>Figure A is a large square. Figure B is a large square with a smaller square removed. Figure C is composed of two large squares with one smaller square added.</p>\n<p>Figure A</p>\n<p><img alt=\"A square.\" height=\"96\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/d28af56f9faeb2db1a12d7156f3528814ed815e4\" width=\"96\"></p>\n<p>Figure B</p>\n<p><img alt=\"A square with a 1 by 1 square removed from the lower left interior.\" height=\"96\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/c3cfac891ace1f56f136f8b22a4de52ec5fbcbce\" width=\"96\"></p>\n<p>Figure C</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Two large squares connected on the right side to a one by one smaller square.\" height=\"96\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/1aee0b31bb1dccc91cbffadcad11bc90255ad88c\" width=\"163\"></p>\n<p>Write an expression to represent the area of each shaded figure when the side length of the large square is as shown in the first column.</p>\n<p>Copy and complete the table.

Include all equivalent expressions. Students may notice that all the expressions have a variable or a term that is squared. Explain that all of the expressions are quadratic expressions. Some expressions may seem familiar (for example, the expressions representing the area of Figure A) and others may seem quite foreign, but we know that each of them represents the area of a figure given a particular side length of the square.</p>"
