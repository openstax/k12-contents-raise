Students have studied exponents and their properties in grade 8 and encountered negative exponents at that time. The goal here is to review the fact that for integer exponents \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) and a non-zero base \\(b\\),&nbsp;this property holds: \\(b^m\\cdot b^n=b^{m+n}\\).</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>How would you rewrite each of the following as an equivalent expression with a single exponent?</p>\n<ol>\n  <li> \\(2^4\\cdot 2^0\\)<br><br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> \\(2^4\\)\n  </li><br>\n  <li> \\(2^4\\cdot 2^{-1}\\)<br><br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> \\(2^3\\)\n  </li><br>\n  <li> \\(2^4\\cdot 2^{-3}\\)<br><br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> \\(2^1\\)\n  </li><br>\n  <li> \\(2^4\\cdot 2^{-4}\\)<br>\n    <strong>Answer:</strong> \\(2^0\\)\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Review, if needed, the conventions that \\(2^0=1\\) and \\(2^{-1}=\\frac12\\), emphasizing that these conventions guarantee that \\(2^a\\cdot 2^b=2^{a+b}\\) for any two integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).&nbsp;</p>"
