They analyze the visual patterns and represent them using tables of values, expressions, and graphs.</p>\n<p>The chosen quadratic pattern enables students to easily see the &ldquo;squaring&rdquo; of one quantity: visually, in the way the dots are arranged, and numerically, in the values in the table (1, 4, 9, etc.). They also notice that when the points representing the relationship are plotted, they form a curve. The term &ldquo;quadratic&rdquo; will be introduced in the next activity.</p>\n<p>Students reason repeatedly about the number of dots at different step numbers and then generalize their observations with variable expressions. They look for and make use of structure to extend the visual patterns. If students opt to use a spreadsheet or graphing technology, they practice choosing appropriate tools strategically.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Some students may choose to use a spreadsheet tool to study the pattern and subsequently to use graphing technology to plot the data. Make these tools accessible, in case they are requested.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>Pattern 1</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Pattern. Step 0,1 dot. Step 1, 3 dots, 2 by 2 with upper left dot removed.

The points representing the second pattern do not lie on a line. They &ldquo;curve&rdquo; upward because the number of dots added at each step increases from step to step.\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Invite students to describe how they see the number of dots change in each pattern. Focus the discussion on the connections between students&rsquo; descriptions, the changes in the table, and the graphs. Make sure these points are uncovered in the discussion:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> For the first pattern, each successive step adds two dots. The growth is constant. The points on the graph form a straight line. </li>\n  <li> For the second pattern, the number of dots that is added changes (and grows) at each step. As a result, the number of dots for the second pattern curves upward when graphed. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Highlight that, in the second pattern, the expression for the number of dots at Step \\(n\\) can be expressed as \\(n^2\\), which can be read as &ldquo;\\(n\\) squared.&rdquo; Point out that the &ldquo;squaring&rdquo; is also evident in the visual pattern.</p>\n<h3>7.2.2: Self Check</h3>\n<p><strong><em>After the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"302\">\n    <col width=\"322\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\">\n        <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>\n        <p><img height=\"116\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/90fb987a737979a109a5022cbec5896a09182c17\" width=\"374\"></p>\n        <p>How many squares will be in Step 5?</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>20</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Incorrect.
