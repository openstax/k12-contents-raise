This means that they could sketch a rough graph that goes through a particular vertex and determine the direction of the opening. The work here reinforces and builds on that earlier observation. Students identify two additional points that are on the graph and use them to help sketch a curve. They also reason about whether the vertex represents the minimum or maximum of the function by analyzing the relative values of the coordinate pairs on either side of the vertex.</p>\n<p>There are multiple opportunities for students to look for and make use of structure here.</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> Given the coordinates of the vertex and of one other point, they may reason that the graph opens up or down by comparing the \\(y\\)-values of the two points. For example, if the vertex is \\((4,10)\\) and one point is \\((0,18)\\), they may conclude that the vertex must be the minimum of the graph simply because the other known point has a greater \\(y\\)-value. </li>\n  <li> After identifying the coordinates of one point on the graph, students may use the symmetry of the graph, the axis of symmetry, of a quadratic function to quickly find the coordinates of a second point. </li>\n  <li> When making sense of Priya's reasoning in the last question, they might notice that in the expression defining \\(p\\), the \\(-(x&minus;4)^2\\) portion has a value of 0 at the vertex (when \\(x\\) is 4), because \\(-(4&minus;4)^2\\) is \\(0^2\\) or 0. For other values of \\(x\\), \\((x&minus;4)^2\\) will always be positive because squaring a number always gives a positive result. But because of the negative coefficient, \\(-(x&minus;4)^2\\) will always be negative or less than 0. This means that for all values of \\(x\\) other than 4, the value of \\(p\\) would be less than \\(p(4)\\). </li>\n</ul>\n<p>As the focus here is on graphing a function by identifying points on the graph and by using structure, technology is not an appropriate tool.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Display the two equations defining \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) for all to see. Give students a moment to think about how the equations are alike and how they are different. Invite students to share their comments.</p>\n<p>If not mentioned by students, ask: \"Where are the vertices of the graphs located?\" (All of the equations have an \\((x&minus;4)^2\\) in them and a 10 constant term. This means that the vertex for each graph is at the same location, at \\((4,10)\\).)</p>\n<p>Remind students that, earlier in the unit, we learned that the vertex of a graph represents the maximum or the minimum value of a function. Ask students:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> \"How can we tell if the vertex of the graph of \\(p\\) represents the maximum or the minimum?\" (If the graph opens upward, the vertex is the minimum. If it opens downward, it is the maximum.) </li>\n  <li> \"How can we tell if the graph of \\(p\\) opens upward or downward?\" (In an earlier lesson, we saw that when a quadratic function is expressed in the form of \\(y=a(x&minus;h)^2+k\\) and the coefficient \\(a\\) is negative, the graph opens downward. This means the vertex represents the maximum of the function. Or we could plot some coordinate pairs to help us visualize the graph.) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>If no students mentioned finding additional points on each graph to determine whether the graph opens up or down, ask them about it.</p>\n<p>Because this activity is designed to be completed without technology, ask students to put away any devices.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>Examine these two equations that define quadratic functions.</p>\n<p>\\(p(x)= -(x&minus;4)^2+10\\)</p>\n<p>\\(q(x)=\\frac {1}{2}(x&minus;4)^2+10\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>The graph of \\(p\\) passes through \\((0,-6)\\) and \\((4,10)\\), as shown on the coordinate plane.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img height=\"404\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/70b01f6147ee71f3375b8b75b04e230921ad040c\" width=\"428\"></p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" type=\"a\">\n  <li> Find the coordinates of another point on the graph of \\(p\\).

Substituting 2 for \\(x\\), we have: \\(q(2)=\\frac {1}{2}(2&minus;4)^2+10\\), which is 12, so \\((2,12)\\) is one point on the graph.

Without telling students a specific value to use, encourage them to choose an \\(x\\)-value that is simple to evaluate and would help them sketch the graph.</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Invite students to share their graphs and how they went about finding the coordinates of one other point on the graph of \\(p\\) and two other points on the graph of \\(q\\). Highlight explanations that make use of the symmetry of the graph to identify an additional point on the graph once one point (aside from the vertex) is known.</p>\n<p>Then, select students to explain their analysis of Pilar's reasoning. Make sure students see that the vertex of the graph of \\(p\\) cannot be the minimum value of the function (and thus cannot have an upward-opening graph) because there are other values of \\(p\\) that are less than 10. If the vertex was the minimum, no other values of \\(p\\) would be less than at \\(p(4)\\).</p>\n<p>Likewise, once we see that \\((0,-6)\\) is on the graph of \\(p\\) and its \\(y\\)-value is less than that of the vertex, we can reason that the vertex \\((4,10)\\) represents the maximum of the function and the graph would open downward.</p>\n<p>Consider showing a table such as these to clarify the input-output relationship in each function.</p>\n<p>Function \\(p\\)</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"148\">\n    <col width=\"67\">\n    <col width=\"67\">\n    <col width=\"67\">\n    <col width=\"67\">\n    <col width=\"67\">\n    <col width=\"67\">\n    <col width=\"67\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(0\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(1\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(2\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(3\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(4\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(5\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(6\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(-(x&minus;4)^2+10\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(-6\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(1\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(6\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(9\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(10\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(9\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(6\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p>Function \\(q\\)</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"148\">\n    <col width=\"67\">\n    <col width=\"67\">\n    <col width=\"67\">\n    <col width=\"67\">\n    <col width=\"67\">\n    <col width=\"67\">\n    <col width=\"67\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(0\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(1\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(2\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(3\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(4\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(5\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(6\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(\\frac {1}{2}(x&minus;4)^2+10\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(18\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(14 \\frac {1}{2}\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(12\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(10 \\frac {1}{2}\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(10\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(10 \\frac {1}{2}\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(12\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p>If time permits, discuss with students how we can also determine whether the vertex is the maximum or minimum by studying the structure of the squared term in the vertex form.

For example, we can tell that the function \\(p\\) given by \\(p(x)=(x-3)^2+1\\) has a vertex at \\((3,1)\\).</p>\n<p><img height=\"147\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/06ea9e2b84d0ec1d445d1a7db4cf7f8177977f4a\" width=\"247\"></p>\n<p>We also noticed that, when the squared expression \\((x-3)^2\\) has a positive coefficient, the graph opens upward. This means that the vertex \\((3,1)\\) represents the minimum function value.</p>\n<p>But why does the function \\(p\\) take on its minimum value when \\(x\\) is 3?</p>\n<p>Here is one way to explain it: When \\(x=3\\), the squared term \\((x-3)^2\\) equals 0, as \\((3-3)^2=0^2=0\\). When \\(x\\) is any other value besides 3, the squared term \\((x-3)^2\\) is a positive number greater than 0. (Squaring any number results in a positive number.) This means that the output when \\(x \\neq 3\\) will always be greater than the output when \\(x=3\\), so the function \\(p\\) has a minimum value at \\(x=3\\).</p>\n<p>This table shows some values of the function for some values of \\(x\\). Notice that the output is the least when \\(x=3\\) and it increases both as \\(x\\) increases and as it decreases.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"107\">\n    <col width=\"73\">\n    <col width=\"73\">\n    <col width=\"73\">\n    <col width=\"73\">\n    <col width=\"73\">\n    <col width=\"73\">\n    <col width=\"73\">\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(x\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(0\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(1\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(2\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(3\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(4\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(5\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(6\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\((x-3)^2+1\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(10\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(5\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(2\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(1\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(2\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(5\\)</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>\\(10\\)</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<p>The squared term sometimes has a negative coefficient, for instance: \\(h(x)=-2(x+4)^2\\). The \\(x\\) value that makes \\((x+4)^2\\) equal 0 is -4, because \\((-4+4)^2=0^2=0\\). Any other \\(x\\) value makes \\((x+4)^2\\) greater than 0. But when \\((x+4)^2\\) is multiplied by a negative number (-2), the resulting expression, \\(-2(x+4)^2\\), ends up being negative. This means that the output when \\(x-4\\) will always be less than the output when \\(x=-4\\), so the function \\(h\\) has its maximum value when \\(x=-4\\).</p>\n<p><img height=\"138\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/9eaa01d884ff6269f7f491469cb0d2a68ba299a6\" width=\"215\"></p>\n<p>Remember that we can find the \\(y\\)-intercept of the graph representing any function we have seen.

Keep in mind, the \\(y\\)-coordinate will remain at 61. To find the \\(x\\)-coordinate, we need to determine how far apart horizontally the vertex and the other point are located from each other. There are 8 units from -3 to 5, so the new point will also be 8 units from -3 but to the left. Thus, the \\(x\\)-coordinate will be at -11. So, there is another point at \\((-11, 61)\\).</p>"
