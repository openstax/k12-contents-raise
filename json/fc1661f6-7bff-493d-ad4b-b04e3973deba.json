Explain your reasoning.<br>\n  <strong>Answer:</strong> For example: Between 150 cm and 180 cm. The rebound factors are \\(\\frac15\\), \\(\\frac16\\), and 0 (this last measurement is probably not reliable because it could have been a very small bounce height, which would be difficult to measure). Because \\(\\frac15\\) of 150 is 30 and \\(\\frac16\\) of 180 is 30, the ball was probably dropped from between 150 cm and 180 cm.\n</p>\n<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>\n<h5>More Chances</h5>\n<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>"
