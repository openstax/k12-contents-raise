You also explored the value that is at the boundary of an inequality and consider whether it is or isn't a solution to an inequality.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>2.7.2: Identifying Constraints in Inequalities<ul>\n<li>In this activity, you were prompted to interpret several inequalities that represent the constraints in a situation. To explain what the letters in the inequalities mean in the given context, you could not simply match the numbers in the verbal descriptions and those in the inequalities. You worked to attend carefully to the symbols and any operations, and reason both quantitatively and abstractly.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>2.7.2: Self Check </li>\n<li>2.7.3: Writing Inequalities to Represent Constraints<ul>\n<li>Previously, you interpreted given inequalities and made sense of them in terms of a situation. In this activity, you wrote inequalities to represent the constraints in a situation. You identified key quantities and relationships, and thought about ways to represent them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>2.7.3: Self Check </li>\n<li>2.7.4: Writing More Inequalities</li>\n<li>In this activity, you wrote inequalities to represent the number of pounds of grapes that a person could buy in a given situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2.7.5: Practice</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In </h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<!--Q1-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n<p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<p>Correct!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!----------------- Must be included at the bottom of page for dropdown to work ------------>\n<!--Do not edit below line.-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n</div>"
