After assessing the form of the polynomial, and with no other context, students will select an appropriate strategy for factoring the polynomial. They will then implement that strategy by factoring the polynomial down to its fully factored form, where all the factors are prime.</p>\n<p>Additionally, students will analyze an expression to determine if it is prime or fully factored, or if it can be factored further.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Analyze a polynomial by its form, select an appropriate strategy for factoring, and correctly factor the polynomial down to its prime factors. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li> Recognize and use the appropriate method to factor a polynomial completely. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>A10(D) rewrite polynomial expressions of degree one and degree two in equivalent forms using the distributive property;</p>\n        <p>A10(E) factor, if possible, trinomials with real factors in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\), including perfect square trinomials of degree two; and</p>\n        <p>A10(F) decide if a binomial can be written as the difference of two squares and, if possible, use the structure of a difference of two squares to rewrite the binomial.</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n        <p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n        <p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 6.7.1: Factoring Strategies for Polynomials </li>\n  <li> 6.7.2: Reviewing General Strategies to Factor a Polynomial </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> 6.7.2: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 6.7.2: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 6.7.3: Implementing General Strategies for Factoring </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> 6.7.3: Self Check </li>\n    <li> 6.7.3: Additional Resources </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 6.7.4: Is the Polynomial Completely Factored? </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 6.7.5: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>Pencil and paper </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li>None </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson.
