Show your reasoning.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The vertex is at \\((-7,-11)\\).</p>\n<p>\\(f(x)=-(x^2+14x+60)\\)</p>\n<p>\\(f(x)=-(x^2+14x+49+11)\\)</p>\n<p>\\(f(x)=-((x+7)^2+11)\\)</p>\n<p>\\(f(x)=-(x+7)^2&minus;11\\)</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n  <li>Does the \\(y\\)-coordinate of the vertex correspond to a maximum or a minimum value of the function? Explain how you know.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A maximum value. The squared term has a coefficient of -1. The squared term will be 0 when \\(x\\) is -7. For all other values of \\(x\\), the squared term will be subtracted from -11, resulting in outputs that are less than -11.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>If the vertex isn't asked for and the \"value of the maximum or minimum\" is asked for, the maximum or minimum value occurs at the \\(y\\)-value of the vertex because that is the value of the coordinate that represents the vertical height of the point.</p>\n<h3>Response to Student Thinking</h3>\n<h5>Press Pause</h5>\n<p>If students struggle to transform quadratic expressions into vertex form, and it is emphasized in your standards, take a few minutes from the next lesson to highlight examples of misconceptions from student work and use practice problems for additional opportunities to practice.</p>"
