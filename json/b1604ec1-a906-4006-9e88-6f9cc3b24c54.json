Give students a moment of quiet time to work on the first two questions and then time to discuss their responses with their partner before moving on the last two questions.</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Student Facing Statement</h4>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<p>Rewrite each quotient as a sum or a difference. </p>\n</div><div class=\"editor-indent\"><div class=\"body\"><span>a. \\( \\dfrac {4x-10}{2} \\)</span></div><div class=\"body\"><span>b. \\( \\dfrac {1 - 50x}{-2} \\)</span></div><div class=\"body\"><span>c. \\( \\dfrac {5(x+10)}{25} \\)</span></div><div class=\"body\"><span>d. \\( \\dfrac {- \\frac15 x + 5}{2} \\)</span></div></div><div class=\"body\"><ol>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<div class=\"editor-indent\"><div class=\"body\"><span>a. \\( 2x - 5 \\)</span></div><div class=\"body\"><span>b. \\( - \\frac12 + 25x \\)</span></div><div class=\"body\"><span>c. \\( \\frac15 x + 2 \\)</span></div><div class=\"body\"><span>d. \\( - \\frac {1}{10}x + \\frac52 \\)</span></div></div><div class=\"body\"><ol>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<p>Expect some students to give <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 2x-10 \\)</span> or <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 4x-5 \\)</span> as an answer to the first question. To illustrate why these are incorrect, take an example like <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( \\frac{4+6}{2} \\)</span>. Explain that we know that 10 divided by 2 is 5, but if we divide only the 4 or only the 6 by 2, we won&rsquo;t get 5. Alternatively, remind students that fraction bars can be interpreted as division, so each expression can be rewritten as, say, <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( (4x-10) \\div 2 \\)</span>, and we can apply the distributive property.</p>\n<p>The signs of the numbers in the second expression might be a source of confusion. Students might be unsure if the expression should be <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\(&nbsp; - \\frac12 -25x \\)</span>, <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( \\frac12 + 25x \\)</span>, or another expression. Encourage students to substitute a number into the original expression and then try it in each potential answer. To explain why <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( - \\frac12 + 25x \\)</span> is correct, appeal to the distributive property again.</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<p>Invite students to share their equivalent expressions and how they reasoned about them. Display their expressions for all to see. Make sure students see that rewriting the expressions as sums or differences involves distributing the division (or applying the distributive property of division). </p>\n<p>If not mentioned in students&rsquo; explanations, point out each division could be thought of in terms of multiplication. For example, <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( \\frac {4x-10}{2} \\)</span> is equivalent to <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( \\frac12 (4x-10) \\)</span>&nbsp;because dividing by a number (in this case, 2) gives the same result as multiplying by the reciprocal of that number (in this case, <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( \\frac12 \\)</span>). Applying the distributive property of multiplication to <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( \\frac12 (4x-10) \\)</span> enables us to rewrite this product as a difference.</p></div>\n<div class=\"student-summary\">\n<div class=\"body\">\n</div>\n</div>\n"
