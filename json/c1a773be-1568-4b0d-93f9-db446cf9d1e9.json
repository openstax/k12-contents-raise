Both characters (Priya and Andre) took similar steps to solve the related equation, which gave them the same boundary value. But they took different paths to decide the direction of the inequality symbol.</p>\n  <p dir=\"ltr\">One solution path involves testing a value on both sides of the boundary value, and another involves analyzing the structure of the inequality. The former is more familiar given previous work. The latter is less familiar and thus encourages students to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.</p>\n  <h4>Launch</h4>\n  <p dir=\"ltr\">In a class discussion, reintroduce the inequality \\(-\\frac12x + 6 &lt; 4x - 3\\) from Activity 2.8.6. Remind students there are several methods that can be used to solve the inequality. Ask students for suggestions for the first step in solving. Discuss possible first steps, including adding \\(\\frac12x\\) to both sides and multiplying both sides by 2. Ask students to identify any other possible first steps. Reinforce that as long as both sides of the inequality are treated equally, multiple methods are possible, and the solution found will be the same.</p>\n  <p dir=\"ltr\">Arrange students in groups of 2. Give students a few minutes of quiet time to make sense of what Andre and Priya have done, and then time to discuss their thinking with their partner. Pause for a class discussion before students move to the second set of questions and try to solve inequalities using Andre&rsquo;s and Priya&rsquo;s methods.</p>\n  <p dir=\"ltr\">Select students to share their analyses of Andre&rsquo;s and Priya&rsquo;s work. Make sure students can follow Priya&rsquo;s reasoning and understand how Priya decided on \\(x&lt;3\\) by focusing her comparison on \\(4x+3\\) and \\(18-x\\).</p>\n  <h4 dir=\"ltr\">Support for Students with Disabilities</h4>\n  <div>\n    <p dir=\"ltr\"><em>R</em><em>epresentation: Develop Language and Symbols. </em>Display or provide copies of Priya&rsquo;s work and Andre&rsquo;s work on separate displays. Write Priya&rsquo;s and Andre&rsquo;s descriptive phrases (as given on the student-facing materials) in contrasting colors/texts so students can more easily sort and process information.

Encourage these students to check their work by substituting numbers into the original inequality.</p>\n  <h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n  <p dir=\"ltr\">Students should recognize that the solution set for each inequality should be the same regardless of the reasoning method used.</p>\n  <p dir=\"ltr\">Select as many students as time permits to share how they used a strategy similar to Priya&rsquo;s to determine the solution set of each inequality. There may be more than one way to reason structurally about a solution set. Invite students who reason in different ways to share their thinking.

At the appropriate time, invite students to create a visual display showing the two inequalities they selected to solve. Students should consider how to display their work so that another student can interpret what they see. Encourage students to add notes or details to their displays to help communicate their thinking. Begin the whole-class discussion by selecting and arranging 2&ndash;4 displays for all to see. Give students 2&ndash;3 minutes of quiet think time to interpret the displays before inviting the authors to present their work.</p>\n    <p><em>Design Principle(s): Optimize output; Cultivate conversation</em></p>\n  </div>\n  <h4><br></h4>\n  <h4>2.9.3: Self Check <br></h4>\n  <p dir=\"ltr\">Following the activity, students will answer the following question to check their understanding of the concepts explored in the activity.</p>\n  <div align=\"left\" dir=\"ltr\">\n    <table>\n      <colgroup>\n        <col width=\"302\">\n        <col width=\"322\">\n      </colgroup>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td colspan=\"2\">\n            <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>QUESTION:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">Solve the following inequality by solving the related equation and reasoning what the answer may be given the situation.</p>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">\\(\\frac13p&lt;4\\)</p><br>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>\n          </td>\n          <td>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>\n            <p dir=\"ltr\">\\(p &gt; 12\\); The solution to the related equation is \\(p = 12\\).
