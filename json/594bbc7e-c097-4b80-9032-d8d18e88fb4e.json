In this lesson, they explore that connection further.</p>\n<p>Prior to this point, students have not looked closely at how the addition and subtraction symbols in the factors affect the \\(x\\)-intercepts. They also have not considered how or why the connection works, or whether it is a reliable way to determine the \\(x\\)-intercepts. In this lesson, they verify their observations by evaluating the expressions at certain \\(x\\)-values and seeing if they produce an output of 0.</p>\n<p>Students also explore what the factored form can tell us about the vertex and the \\(y\\)-intercept of a graph representing a quadratic function.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Create graphs of quadratic functions that are in factored form. </li>\n<li> Given a quadratic function in factored form, explain how to determine the vertex and \\(y\\)-intercept of its graph. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li> Graph a quadratic function given in factored form. </li>\n<li> Find the vertex and \\(y\\)-intercept of the graph of a quadratic function in factored form without graphing it first. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<colgroup>\n<col>\n<col>\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><p><strong>TEKS</strong></p></td>\n<td><p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><p>A7(A) <u>graph quadratic functions on the coordinate plane and use the graph to identify key attributes, if possible, including \\(x\\)-intercept, \\(y\\)-intercept, zeros, </u>maximum value, minimum values, <u>vertex</u>, and the equation of the axis of symmetry;</p></td>\n<td><p>Partial coverage: Lesson provides content that covers part of this TEKS.
