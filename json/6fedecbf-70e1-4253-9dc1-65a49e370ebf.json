In this lesson, students used data from a table to construct equations representing exponential growth and decay. They used these equations to answer questions given the context of the situation.</p>\n<p>To help students, review the following points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> We looked at some situations where negative values (exponents) representing units of times are meaningful. In those cases, a value of &ndash;1 might represent 1 year before a particular time when an estimate or census occurred. </li>\n<li> Choosing the appropriate labels and tick marks on the axes is important for correctly displaying a graph. Make sure you select intervals that can help differentiate among points but still allow for the display of every point in the data. </li>\n<li> When trying to compare values that are in decimal form and scientific notation, first convert all the values into one form or the other. </li>\n<li> Values written in scientific notation can be used to solve problems in context just like values in decimal form. </li>\n</ul>"
