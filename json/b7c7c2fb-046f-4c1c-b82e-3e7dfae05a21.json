In particular, they study the effect of \\(b\\)&nbsp;on the shape of the graph. To observe how \\(b\\)&nbsp;impacts the shape of the graph when \\(b&gt;1\\) and when \\( 0&lt;b&lt;1\\), they simultaneously examine several functions of this form, all of which have the same value of \\(a\\).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Narrow contexts are used in these lessons to encourage greater attention to the growth factors of the different functions, rather than on interpreting the quantities in context. Since students are focusing mainly on understanding how varying \\(b\\)&nbsp;impacts the graph, they are looking at the structure of an exponential function and its graph. Connecting exponential functions to real-world situations helps students understand why it is important to learn about this type of function.</p>\n<p>One of the activities in this lesson works best when each student has access to devices that can run a Desmos applet because students will benefit from seeing the relationship in a dynamic way.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Describe (orally and in writing) the effect of changing \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) on a graph that represents \\(f(x)=a \\cdot b^x\\). </li>\n  <li> Use equations and graphs to compare exponential functions. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4> Learning Targets (Student Facing)&nbsp;</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li> Describe the effect of changing \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) on a graph that represents \\(f(x)=a \\cdot b^x\\). </li>\n  <li> Use equations and graphs to compare exponential functions. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)&nbsp;</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>A9(D) graph exponential functions that model growth and decay and identify key features, including \\(y\\)-intercept and asymptote, in mathematical and real-world problems; and</p>\n        <p>A3(E) determine the effects on the graph of the parent function \\(f(x) = x\\) when \\(f(x)\\) is replaced by \\(af(x)\\), \\(f(x) + d\\), \\(f(x - c)\\), \\(f(bx)\\) for specific values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\);</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n        <p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4> Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 5.12.1: Modeling Exponential Decay </li>\n  <li> 5.12.2: Equations and Their Graphs <ul>\n      <li> 5.12.2: Self Check</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li> 5.12.2: Additional Resources</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li> 5.12.3: Graphs Representing Exponential Decay <ul>\n      <li> 5.12.3: Self Check</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li> 5.12.2: Additional Resources</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li> 5.12.4: Possible Equation for a Function on a Graph </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in 5.12.5: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<p>Graphing technology</p>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<p>Acquire devices that can run Desmos (recommended) or other graphing technology.
