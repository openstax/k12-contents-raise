Some of his family members would like a second serving, so he went back to the same food stand and bought another 2 cups of hot cocoa and 4 pretzels for $11.20.</p>\n<p>Here is a system of equations that represents the quantities and constraints in this situation.</p>\n<p>\\( \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{c l} 5c + 4p = 18.40\\\\ 2c + 4p = 11.20 \\end{array}\\right. \\)<br></p>\n<p><span>1. What does the solution to the system, \\( (c, p) \\), represent in this situation?</span><br></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-prompt\">\n<p>Enter your answer here:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-ack\">\n<p>Compare your answer:</p>\n<p>The values of \\(c\\)&nbsp;and \\(p\\)&nbsp;represent the price of a cup of hot cocoa and the price of a pretzel that Marlon bought. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!--Question 2 -->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-content\">2. If we add the second equation to the first equation, we have a new equation: \\(&nbsp;7c + 8p = 29.60&nbsp;\\).\n    <p>Explain why the same \\(&nbsp;(c, p)&nbsp;\\) pair that is a solution to the two original equations is also a solution to this new equation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-prompt\">\n<p>Enter your answer here:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-ack\">\n<p>Compare your answer to the sample explanations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The new equation shows the total number of cups of hot cocoa and total number of pretzels on one side, and the total amount Marlon spent on the other side. The price of each cup of hot cocoa and the price of each pretzel haven&rsquo;t changed.</li><br>\n<li>\\(2c + 4p\\)&nbsp;and 11.20 are equal, so adding \\(2c + 4p\\)&nbsp;to one side of an equation and adding 11.20 to the other side means adding equal amounts to the two sides of an equation. This keeps the two sides equal. The same values of \\(p\\)&nbsp;and \\(c\\)&nbsp;that make the original equations true haven&rsquo;t changed.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!--Question 3-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-content\">3. Does the equation \\(&nbsp;7c + 8p = 29.60&nbsp;\\) help us solve the original system? If you think so, explain how it helps. If you don&rsquo;t think so, explain why not and what would help us solve the system.\n    <p><span>Enter your answer here:</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-input-ack\">\n<p>Compare your answer:</p>\n<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t help. Sample reasoning: It doesn&rsquo;t eliminate a variable. What would help is subtracting the second equation from the first to get \\(3c = 7.20\\). Then we can find \\(c\\) and solve for \\(p\\).&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4>Video: Solving Systems of Equations Using Real-World Examples</h4>\n<p>Watch the following video to learn more about when addition is useful for solving systems of equations.
