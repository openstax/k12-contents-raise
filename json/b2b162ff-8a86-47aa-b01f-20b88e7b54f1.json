Find the constant of variation.</li>\n<li>Now, write the equation if Jesse travels d miles with a car that uses 30 miles per gallon of gas.</li>\n<li>If Las Vegas is 285 miles away, how many gallons of gas are needed to get there?</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Student Response</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Use the equation for direct variation \\( y=kx \\). So, \\( d=kg \\).</li>\n<li>Use the equation for direct variation \\( y=kx \\). So, 150=k(5). The constant of variation is \\( k=30 \\).</li>\n<li>\\( d=30g \\)</li>\n<li>Substitute 285 miles in for \\( d \\) in the equation. So, \\( 285=30g \\) and \\( g=9.5 \\).</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Response to Student Thinking</h3>\n<h4>More Chances</h4>\n<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.<br>\n</p>"
