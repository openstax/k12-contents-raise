In this lesson, students develop this work more formally, while continuing to use the idea of function as the focusing lens.</p>\n<p>Students use mathematical terms such as &ldquo;intercept,&rdquo; &ldquo;maximum,&rdquo; and &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; in their graphical analyses, and they relate features of graphs to features of the functions represented. For instance, they look at an interval in which a graph shows a positive slope and interpret that to mean an interval where the function&rsquo;s values are increasing. Students also use statements in function notation, such as \\(h(0)\\) and \\(h(t)=0\\), to talk about key features of a graph.</p>\n<p>By now, students are familiar with the idea of intercepts. Note that in these materials, the terms &ldquo;horizontal intercept&rdquo; and &ldquo;vertical intercept&rdquo; are used to refer to intercepts more generally, especially when a function is defined using variables other than \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). If needed, clarify these terms for students who may be accustomed to using only \\(x\\)-intercept and \\(y\\)-intercept.</p>\n<p>As students look for connections across representations of functions and relate them to quantities in situations, they practice making sense of problems and reasoning quantitatively and abstractly. Using mathematical terms and notation to describe features of graphs and features of functions calls for attention to precision.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Analyze connections between statements that use function notation and features of graphs and describe (orally and in writing) these connections.</li>\n<li>Interpret key features of a graph&mdash;the intercepts, maximums, minimums, and the intervals when the function is increasing or decreasing&mdash;in terms of a situation.</li>\n<li>Understand and be able to use the terms &ldquo;horizontal intercept,&rdquo; &ldquo;vertical intercept,&rdquo; &ldquo;maximum,&rdquo; and &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; when talking about graphs of functions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4> Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify important features of graphs of functions and explain what they mean in the situations represented.</li>\n<li>Explain and apply the terms &ldquo;horizontal intercept,&rdquo; &ldquo;vertical intercept,&rdquo; &ldquo;maximum,&rdquo; and &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; when talking about functions and their graphs.</li>\n<li>Identify important features of linear functions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<colgroup>\n<col>\n<col>\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>A3(C) graph linear functions on the coordinate plane and identify key features, including \\(x\\) intercept, \\(y\\)-intercept, zeros, and slope, in mathematical and real-world problems;</p>\n<br>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</p>\n<br>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br>\n<h4>Lesson Activities</h4>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4.6.1: Interpreting Statements in Function Notation</li>\n<li>4.6.2: Analyzing Graphs of Functions\n    <ul>\n<li>4.6.2: Self Check</li>\n<li>4.6.2: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>4.6.3: Connecting Graphical and Verbal Representations of a Function</li>\n<ul>\n<li>4.6.3: Self Check</li>\n<li>4.6.3: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n<li>4.6.4: Key Features of Linear Functions</li>\n<ul>\n<li>4.6.4: Self Check</li>\n<li>4.6.4: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n<li>4.6.5: Interpreting Graphs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also complete a series of problems in the 4.6.6: Practice.</p>\n<h4>Required Materials</h4>\n<p>None</p>\n<h4>Required Preparation</h4>\n<p>None</p>\n<h4>Lesson Vocabulary</h4>\n<p>During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson.
