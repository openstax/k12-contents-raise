The scatter plot below shows the distance from &ldquo;Go&rdquo; to a property (in number of spaces moving from &ldquo;Go&rdquo; in a clockwise direction) and the price of the properties on the Monopoly board. The equation of the line is \\(P = 8x + 40\\), where \\(P\\) represents the price (in Monopoly dollars) and \\(x\\) represents the distance (in number of spaces).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img alt=\"A SCATTER PLOT THAT SHOWS DISTANCE FROM GO IN NUMBER OF SPACES ON THE X-AXIS AND PRICE OF PROPERTY IN MONOPOLY DOLLARS ON THE Y-AXIS.

This means that for every space from &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; the price of the property increases $8.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Notice this gives an estimate. The most expensive property is 39 spaces from &ldquo;Go&rdquo; and costs $400. The model would give the price to be \\(y=8(39)+40\\) or $352.</p>\n<p>The model gives a difference of $48 between the estimated price using the model and the actual price.</p>\n<h4>Try It: Using Linear Models</h4>\n<p><img alt=\"A SCATTER PLOT THAT SHOWS MEAN TEMPERATURE IN JULY IN DEGREES FAHRENHEIT ON THE X-AXIS AND MEAN RAINFALL PER YEAR IN INCHES ON THE Y-AXIS.
