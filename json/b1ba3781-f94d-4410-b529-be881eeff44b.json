For that function, they should take turns identifying the following features on the graph and interpreting them in terms of the situation:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>vertical intercept</li>\n  <li>horizontal intercept</li>\n  <li>maximum</li>\n  <li>minimum</li>\n  <li>intervals where the function is increasing</li>\n  <li>intervals where the function is decreasing</li>\n  <li>intervals where the function is staying constant</li>\n  <li>solution or solutions to \\(b(t)=3.5\\) or \\(d(t)=3.5\\)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, discuss questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>&ldquo;How can you tell that a point on the graph is a maximum, a minimum, or neither?&rdquo; (Look around it, left and right, to see whether the given point is higher than all the other points, lower than all the others, or neither.)</li>\n  <li>&ldquo;How many intercepts can the graph of a function have?&rdquo; (An unlimited number on the horizontal axis, but only one on the vertical axis.)</li>\n</ul>"
