This warm-up prompts students to interpret and make sense of some equations in context, familiarizing them with the quantities and relationships. Later in the lesson, students will dig deeper into what the parameters and graphs of the equations reveal. </p>\n</div>\n<h3>Launch</h3>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Give students a couple of minutes of quiet work time and then another minute to share their response with their partner. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<p>Jada has <span>$</span>20 to spend on games and rides at a carnival. Games cost <span>$</span>1 each, and rides are <span>$</span>2 each.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Which equation represents the relationship between the number of games, <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( x \\)</span>, and the number of rides, <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( y \\)</span>, that Jada could do if she spends all her money?</p>\n<div class=\"imgrid\">\n<div class=\"g--row g--row-1\">\n<div class=\"g--col-1 g--column g--content g--one-third g--row-1\">\n<p>A: <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( x + y = 20 \\)</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"g--col-2 g--column g--content g--one-third g--row-1\">\n<p>B: <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 2x + y = 20 \\)</span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"g--col-3 g--column g--content g--one-third g--row-1\">\n<p>C: <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( x + 2y = 20 \\)</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain what each of the other two equations could mean in this situation.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<h3>Student Response</h3>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<ol>\n<li>Equation C</li>\n<li>Sample responses:\n                        <ul>\n<li>A: Jada spends <span>$</span>20 on games and rides, which are <span>$</span>1 each.</li>\n<li>A: The combined number of games and rides that Jada enjoys is 20.</li>\n<li>B: Jada spends <span>$</span>20 on games and rides, where games are <span>$</span>2 each and rides are <span>$</span>1 each.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<p>Invite students to share their interpretations of the equations.</p>\n<p>Most students are likely to associate the 20 in the equation with the <span>$</span>20 that Jada has, but some students may interpret it to mean the combined number of games and rides Jada enjoys. (This is especially natural to do for <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( x+y=20 \\)</span>.) If this interpretation comes up, acknowledge that it is valid. </p>\n</div><br></div><div class=\"student-summary\"><div class=\"body\"><div class=\"imgrid\"><div class=\"g--row g--row-1\"><div class=\"g--col-2 g--column g--content g--half g--row-1\">\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"
