Give students quiet time to think individually. Select students to share their responses and how they reasoned about the side length and area of each square.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity</h4>\n<p>Here are some squares whose vertices are on a grid.</p>\n<p><img height=\"144\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/700b7d8bfe426c8ce18db3445ff0e69c45963d39\" width=\"468\"></p>\n<p>Find the area and the side length of each square.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>What is the area of Graph A?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 9<br>\n  9 square units</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n  <li>What is the side length of Graph A?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 3<br>\n  3 units</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\">\n  <li>What is the area of Graph B?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 2<br>\n  2 square units</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"4\">\n  <li>What is the side length of Graph B?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) units</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"5\">\n  <li>What is the area of Graph C?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 10<br>\n  10 square units</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"6\">\n  <li>What is the side length of Graph C?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \\(\\sqrt{10}\\) units</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Invite students to share their solutions. It is not essential to discuss how students found the area. What is important is that students recall that we can use the square root notation \\(\\sqrt{9}\\) to refer to the side length of a square with area 9 square units and that \\(\\sqrt{9}=3\\). When the area is 2 or 10 square units, the square root of each number is not a whole number or a fraction, but we can write \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{10}\\) rather than writing their decimal approximations.</p>\n<p>Remind students that any positive number has two square roots because there are two numbers (one positive and one negative) that, when squared, give that number. Also remind students that the \\(\\sqrt{\\;\\;}\\) symbol refers only to the positive square root of a number. In this context, if \\(s\\) is the side length of a square and \\(A\\) its area, we can describe the relationship between the two quantities as \\(s=\\sqrt{A}\\) because only positive side lengths make sense.</p>"
