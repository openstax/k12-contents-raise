For instance, they may reason that:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>When the middle child is 12, the youngest child is 7, and substituting <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( m=12 \\)</span> and <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( y=7 \\)</span> to <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 2m-2y \\)</span> gives <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 2(12) - 2(7) \\)</span> or <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 24 - 14 \\)</span>, which is 10.

Record and display the equations for all to see. Along the way, consider organizing them into categories (numerical equations, equations in one variable, and equations in two variables).</p>\n  <p>Solicit from students some thoughts on the following questions. (It is not necessary to resolve the questions at the moment.)</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>&ldquo;Consider the equations you wrote for each situation. Are they all equivalent? Why or why not?&rdquo;</li>\n    <li>&ldquo;What do you think it means for two equations to be equivalent?&rdquo;</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Some students might say that each equation accurately represents the same relationship between the ages, so the equations must be equivalent. Those who wrote variable equations might say that the equations are equivalent because the same value for the variable makes each equation true. </p>\n  <p>After students have had a chance to consider these questions, prompt them to complete the remaining questions.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>\n<div class=\"body\">\n  <p>1.

All of the equations in the last question are equivalent because they have 3 as the solution and they all have no other solutions.\n          </li>\n          <li>Suppose we start with a true equation, where the two sides are equal. If we perform the same operation to both sides of the equation and get a new equation where the two sides are also equal, we can say that the two equations are equivalent. For instance:\n            <ul>\n              <li>Subtracting 6 from both sides of <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 3a + 6 = 15 \\)</span>&nbsp;gives <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 3a=9 \\)</span>. If <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 3a+6 \\)</span> and 15 are equal, then the expressions or numbers we get by subtracting 6 from each one are also equal. We can conclude that <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 3a+6=15 \\)</span> and <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 3a=9 \\)</span> are equivalent.</li>\n              <li>Dividing both sides of <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 3a + 6 = 15 \\)</span> by 3 gives <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( a + 2 = 5 \\)</span>. If <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 3a+6 \\)</span> is equal to 15, the result of dividing <span class=\"math math-repaired\">\\( 3a+6 \\)</span> by 3 is equal to dividing 15 by 3.
