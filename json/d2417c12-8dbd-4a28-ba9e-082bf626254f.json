You looked at which operations were equivalent and which ones were inverses of each other. </li>\n  </ul>\n  <li> 5.2.2: The nth Root <ul>\n      <li> In this activity, you analyzed what happens to negative numbers when they are raised to an odd and even power. You were also introduced to new vocabulary such as radical, index, and radicand and discovered how they are related to perfect squares and square roots. </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><span>5.2.2: Self Check</span><br></li>\n  <li> 5.2.3: Radicals and Rational Exponents <ul>\n      <li> In this activity, you extended radicals and root indices even further by looking at rational exponents. You rewrote expressions from radical form to rational exponent form. </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><span>5.2.3: Self Check</span><br></li>\n  <li> 5.2.4: Properties of Exponents with Rationals </li>\n  <ul>\n    <li> In this activity, you applied the properties of exponents to expressions with rational exponents. You were able to practice using the same properties of exponents from an earlier lesson. </li>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> 5.2.5: Practice </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-content-id=\"f29c2c62-ffbd-457f-a812-d965e737d93d\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <!--pulldown-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-content-id=\"2f217a1b-739e-4f9f-ad28-c365dc187023\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n      <p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n      <p>Correct!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n      <p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!--Do not edit below line.-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n</div>"
