Discuss questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>&ldquo;What are some ways for comparing a quadratic growth function and an exponential growth function?&rdquo; (By comparing their values in a table, by graphing the equations representing them, or by comparing the growth factors as the input increases.) </li>\n  <li>&ldquo;When we compared \\(n^2\\) and \\(2^n\\), we saw the value of \\(2^n\\) become greater than \\(n^2\\) at \\(n=5\\). When we compared \\(6x^2\\) and \\(3^x\\), we saw \\(3^x\\) overtaking \\(6x^2\\) by the time \\(x\\) reaches \\(5\\). If we compare, say, \\(1,000x^2\\) and \\(2^x\\), will the exponential still overtake the quadratic? If so, at what \\(x\\)-value do you think it would happen? If not, why not?&rdquo; (Yes. It would probably happen when \\(x\\) is between \\(15\\) and \\(20\\).)</li>\n</ul>"
