Which of the following could define function \\(g\\)? Explain your reasoning.</p>\n<p>Equation A: \\(g(x)=20 \\cdot (1.5)^x\\)</p>\n<p>Equation B: \\(g(x)=20 \\cdot (2.5)^x\\)</p>\n<p>Equation C: \\(g(x)=10 \\cdot (3.5)^x\\)</p>\n<p>Equation D: \\(g(x)=20 \\cdot (4.5)^x\\)</p>\n<p> <strong>Answer:</strong></p>\n<p>Equation B. The graph of \\(g\\)&nbsp;has the same \\(y\\)-intercept as the graph of \\(h\\), which is 20. It grows more quickly than \\(f\\)&nbsp;but more slowly than \\(h\\),&nbsp;so the growth factor must be greater than 2 but less than 4.</p>\n<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>\n<h5> More Chances</h5>\n<p>The warm-up in Lesson 13 provides an opportunity to discuss the ideas in this cool-down. Use the information you get about student thinking from this cool-down to guide the synthesis of the warm-up in Lesson 13.</p>"
