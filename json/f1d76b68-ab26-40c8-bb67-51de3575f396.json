You will use a table of values to study the relationship between price and revenue, write an equation to define the function, and consider what the graph of the function tells us about the situation being modeled.</p>\n<p>When you finish this lesson, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Choose a domain that makes sense in a revenue situation. </li>\n<li> Model revenue with quadratic functions and graphs. </li>\n<li> Relate the vertex of a graph and the zeros of a function to a revenue situation. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are the activities that will help you reach those goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 7.7.1: Comparing Graphs of Functions </li>\n<li> 7.7.2: Modeling Real-World Data with Quadratic Functions </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 7.7.2: Self Check </li>\n<li> 7.7.2: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 7.7.3: The Domain, Vertex, and Zero of Quadratic Functions </li>\n<ul>\n<li> 7.7.3: Self Check </li>\n<li> 7.7.3: Additional Resources </li>\n</ul>\n<li> 7.7.4: Relate the Domain of a Function to Its Graph </li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll practice and review.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> 7.7.5: Practice </li>\n<li> 7.7.6: Lesson Summary </li>\n</ul>"
