To reverse this process, many of the same skills are needed.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example.</p>\n<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>\n<p>Write \\(x^2+16x +63\\) in factored form.</p>\n<p>To do this, we must think about how you converted from factored form into standard form. First, check if the leading coefficient (for the quadratic term) is 1. If so, then:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> To find the coefficient of the middle term, 16, we added two numbers together from the diagram. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-indent\">\n  <li> To find the last term or constant, 63, we multiplied two numbers together from the diagram. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, which numbers, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), have a sum of 16 and a product of 63?</p>\n<p><img alt=\" DIAGRAM THAT SHOWS A PLUS B AND A TIMES B WITH ARROWS GOING TO 16 AND 63 IN THE QUADRATIC EXPRESSION, X-SQUARED PLUS 16X PLUS 63.\" height=\"147\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/864bde4e5cff9d5f8e6acdf306622f0e768223e7\" width=\"200\"></p>\n<p>The positive factors of 63 include:</p>\n<p>1, 63<br>\n  3, 21<br>\n  7, 9</p>\n<p>With some reasoning, we find that 7 and 9 are the numbers we want.</p>\n<p>So, the factored form of \\(x^2+16x +63\\) is \\((x + 7)(x + 9)\\).</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at another example.</p>\n<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>\n<p>Write \\(x^2&minus;10x +16\\) in factored form.</p>\n<p>The sign of the middle term is negative, but we follow the same process since the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is 1.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s rewrite the expression as \\(x^2+ -10x +16\\).</p>\n<p>Which numbers have a sum of &ndash;10 and a product of 16?</p>\n<p>The factors of 16 include:</p>\n<p>1, 16<br>&ndash;1, &ndash;16<br>\n  2, 8<br>&ndash;2, &ndash;8<br>\n  4, 4<br>&ndash;4, &ndash;4</p>\n<p>The numbers we need are &ndash;2 and &ndash;8 because they have a product of 16 and a sum of &ndash;10.</p>\n<p>So, the factored form is \\((x + (-2))(x + (-8))\\). This can be rewritten as \\((x &minus; 2)(x &minus; 8)\\).</p>\n<h4>Try It: Rewriting Quadratic Expressions in Standard Form</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta\" data-button-text=\"Solution\" data-fire-event=\"Reveal1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-content\">\n    <p>Find the factored form of each expression.</p>\n    <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n      <li>\\(x^2+9x +18\\)</li>\n    </ol>\n    <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n      <li>\\(x^2&minus;12x +35\\)</li>\n    </ol>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-cta-prompt\">\n    <p>Write down your answers, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-content\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\" data-wait-for-event=\"Reveal1\">\n  <p>Here is how to rewrite quadratic equations in standard form into factored form:</p>\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n    <li>\\((x + 6)(x + 3)\\); Since the coefficients of the \\(x\\)-terms are both 1, think of two numbers that have a sum of 9 and a product of 18.</li>\n  </ol>\n  <ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n    <li>\\((x &minus; 5)(x &minus; 7)\\); Since the coefficients of the \\(x\\)-terms are both 1, think of two numbers that have a sum of &ndash;12 and a product of 35.</li>\n  </ol>\n</div>"
