In this activity, they review the\n    meaning of a solution to an equation in two variables. </p>\n</div>\n<h3>Launch</h3>\n<div>\n  <p>Arrange students\n    in groups of 2&ndash;3. Without giving away the equation, present the\n    scenario and ask students whether they are familiar with this kind of\n    situation. Then encourage students to use Desmos to model the scenario\n    with an equation.</p>\n  <p>As students\n    work, quietly ask one or two students if they would be willing to share\n    their reasoning with the class. After they share out, discuss why the\n    values in problems 1a and 1c do not satisfy the equation (or appear on\n    the graph).</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Student-Facing Statement</h3>\n<div>\n  <p>One gram of protein contains 4 calories. One gram of fat contains 9 calories. A snack has 60 calories from <span>\\( p \\)</span> grams of protein and <span>\\( f \\)</span> grams of fat.</p>\n  <p>The equation <span>\\( 4p+9f = 60 \\)</span> represents the relationship between these quantities. </p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      Determine\n      if each pair of values could be the number of grams of protein and fat\n      in the snack. Be prepared to explain your reasoning.\n      <ol>\n        <li>5 grams of protein and 2 grams of fat\n        </li>\n        <li>10.5 grams of protein and 2 grams of fat\n        </li>\n        <li>8 grams of protein and 4 grams of fat\n        </li>\n      </ol>\n    </li>\n    <li>If there are 6 grams of fat in the snack, how many grams of protein are there? Show your reasoning.\n    </li>\n    <li>In this situation, what does a solution to the equation <span>\\( 4p+9f = 60 \\)</span> tell us? Give an example of a solution.\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n</div>\n<h4>Video: Working Through the Equation</h4>\n<p>Watch\n  the following video to learn more about how to determine a solution to this particular equation: \\( 4p+ 9f = 60\\).</p>\n<video controls=\"true\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\">\n  <source src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/ce9b7554a5f6c2231ff7bae0a6c1e09f8ad55e39\">\n  <track default=\"true\" kind=\"captions\" label=\"On\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/92159e35ce10b76ecda963022a98325d7722afac \" srclang=\"en_us\">https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/ce9b7554a5f6c2231ff7bae0a6c1e09f8ad55e39\n</video>\n<p></p><br>\n<h3><span>Student Response</span></h3>\n<div>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Answers:<ol>\n        <li><span>No</span></li>\n        <li><span>Yes&nbsp;</span></li>\n        <li><span>No</span></li>\n      </ol>\n    </li>\n    <li>1.5 grams. Sample reasoning: <span>\\( 4p + 9(6) = 60 \\)</span>, so <span>\\( p \\)</span> must be 1.5 for the equation to be true.</li>\n    <li>Sample\n      response: It means a pair of grams of protein and fat in the snack that\n      add up to 60 calories. An example: 6 grams of protein and 4 grams of\n      fat.</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p></p>\n</div>\n<h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>\n<div>\n  <p>The goal of the discussion is to make sure students\n    understand that a solution to an equation in two variables is any pair\n    of values that, when substituted into the equation and evaluated, make\n    the equation true. Discuss questions such as:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>&ldquo;In this situation, what does it mean when we say that \\( p=12 \\) and \\( f=1.5 \\) are <em>not</em>\n      solutions to the equation?&rdquo; (They are not a combination of protein and\n      fat that would produce 60 calories. Substituting them for the variables\n      in the equation leads to a false equation of \\( 61.5=60 \\).) </li>\n    <li>&ldquo;How did you find out the grams of protein in\n      the snack given that there are 6 grams of fat?&rdquo; (Substitute 6 for \\( f \\) and solve the equation.)</li>\n    <li>&ldquo;Can you find another combination that is a solution?&rdquo;</li>\n    <li>&ldquo;How many possible combinations of grams of\n      protein and fat (or \\( p \\) and \\( f \\)) would add up to 60 calories?&rdquo;\n      (many solutions) </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>As a segue to the next lesson, solicit some ideas on\n    how we know that there are many solutions to the equation. If no one\n    mentions using a graph, bring it up and tell students that they will\n    explore the graphs of two-variable equations next.</p>\n  <p><br></p>\n  <h2>1.4.3: Self Check <br></h2>\n  <div>\n    <div>\n      <div>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <p><strong><em>Following the activity, students will\n                  answer the following question to check their understanding of the\n                  concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n            <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n              <tbody>\n                <tr>\n                  <td colspan=\"2\"><strong>QUESTION:</strong><br><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5ec63dc8-7fff-7cd2-6ea8-ea66455955bb\">Which of the following is a solution \\((x, y)\\) to \\( 2x + 3y = 7\\)?</span></td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td><strong>Answers</strong></td>\n                  <td><strong>Feedback</strong></td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-c8e818e0-7fff-db92-aa7f-4d2c5f336f95\">\\((2, 1)\\)</span></td>\n                  <td>That&rsquo;s correct!
