They also practice interpreting the language related to maximum and minimum values of functions.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Ask students to describe some situations in which people use the words \"minimum\" and \"maximum.\" For example, we might say there is a minimum age for voting or for getting a driver's license, or that roads and highways have maximum speed limits.</p>\n<p>Then, ask students what the words \"minimum\" and \"maximum\" mean more generally. We might think of a minimum as the least, the least possible, or the least allowable value, and a maximum as the greatest, the greatest possible, or the greatest allowable value.</p>\n<h4>Student Activity&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>Examine the graph that represents the function, \\(f\\), defined by \\(f(x)=(x&minus;4)^2+1\\).</p>\n<p><img height=\"291\" src=\"https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4246a818d67db1e72a333d627b6aa12064c74adc\" width=\"300\"></p>\n<p>Use this graph to answer questions 1 and 2.</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li>\\(f(1)\\) can be expressed in words as \"the value of \\(f\\) when \\(x\\) is 1.\" Find or compute:</li>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" type=\"a\">\n  <li> the value of \\(f\\) when \\(x\\) is 1</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 10</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\" type=\"a\">\n  <li>\\( f(3)\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 2</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"3\" type=\"a\">\n  <li> \\(f(10)\\)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 37</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\">\n  <li>Can you find an \\(x\\)-value that would make \\(f(x)\\):</li>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" type=\"a\">\n  <li>Less than 1?</li>\n</ol>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Yes </li>\n  <li> No </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> No<br>\n  From the graph, it seems that 1 is the least value of \\(f\\), and that occurs when \\(x=4\\).

All other \\(x\\)-values produce outputs that are less than 7.&nbsp;</p>\n<ol class=\"os-raise-noindent\" start=\"2\" type=\"a\">\n  <li>Less than -10,000?</li>\n</ol>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Yes </li>\n  <li> No </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes&nbsp;<br>\n  There are lots of \\(x\\)-values that produce an output less than -10,000. For example, both -200 and 200 would make \\(g(x)\\) greater than -10,000.</p>\n<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>\n<p>Some students may struggle to relate the \\(y\\)-coordinates of the points on a graph with the outputs of a function. Earlier in the course, students learned that the graph of a function \\(f\\) is the graph of the equation \\(y=f(x)\\). Consider having students label the coordinates of points on each graph and then complete the statements, such as, \"The point \\((3,2)\\) on the graph means \\(2=f(3)\\).\" Another approach would be to have students organize the points on the graphs into tables with headers \\(x\\) and \\(f(x)\\) and \\(x\\) and \\(g(x)\\).</p>\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Discuss with students:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> \"Why does \\(f\\) not have a maximum value?\" (We can always use larger values of \\(x\\) in both the positive and negative directions to get greater and greater values of \\(f\\).) </li>\n  <li> \"Why does \\(g\\) not have a minimum value?\" (We can always find an input that makes the value of \\(g\\) less and less.) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Emphasize that we can find an input that makes the value of \\(f\\) as great as we want and that makes \\(g\\) as small as we want.</p>\n<p>Remind students that:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> A maximum value of a function is a value of a function that is greater than or equal to all the other values. It corresponds to the highest \\(y\\)-value on the graph of the function.&nbsp; </li>\n  <li> A minimum value of a function is a value of a function that is less than or equal to all the other values. It corresponds to the lowest point on the graph of the function. </li>\n  <li> For quadratic functions, there is only one maximum or minimum value. </li>\n</ul>"
