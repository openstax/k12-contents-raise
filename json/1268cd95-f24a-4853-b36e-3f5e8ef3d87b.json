By solving these quadratic equations, they can determine how long it would take for a burst of water to travel up from a jet and back down to the surface of the water.</p>\n<p>In this section, you will continue to model real-world problems using quadratic equations. You will see that writing and solving quadratic equations enables you to find input values that produce certain output values. You will solve quadratic equations in their factored form using the zero product property. You will also rewrite quadratic equations from their standard form into their factored form so that you can find their zeros, or solutions.</p>\n<p>This section includes eight lessons:</p>\n<ul class=\"os-raise-noindent\">\n  <li> Solving Quadratic Equations by Reasoning </li>\n  <li> Solving Quadratic Equations with the Zero Product Property </li>\n  <li> How Many Solutions? </li>\n  <li> Rewriting Quadratic Expressions in Factored Form (Part 1) </li>\n  <li> Rewriting Quadratic Expressions in Factored Form (Part 2) </li>\n  <li> Rewriting Quadratic Expressions in Factored Form (Part 3) </li>\n  <li> Solving Quadratic Equations by Using Factored Form </li>\n  <li> Rewriting Quadratic Expressions in Factored Form (Part 4) </li>\n</ul>"
