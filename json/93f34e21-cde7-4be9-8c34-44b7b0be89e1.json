In the first activity, students analyze points on a graph to identify their meaning in context. In the second activity, students identify slopes and intercepts from graphs and match equations to graphs. Finally, students create their own scenarios to match a linear equation.</p>\n<h3>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h3>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Analyze the relationship among linear equations, graphs, and verbal descriptions.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n    Identify slopes and intercepts from a graph.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Identify an equation that matches a graph.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Create a real-world scenario from a graph.\n\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n    A2(C) write linear equations in two variables given a table of values, a graph, and a verbal description</li>\n<li>A3(A) determine the slope of a line given a table of values, a graph, two points on the line, and an equation written in various forms, including y = mx + b, Ax + By = C, and y - y1 = m(x - x1)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>A3(C) graph linear functions on the coordinate plane and identify key features, including x-intercept, y-intercept, zeros, and slope, in mathematical and real-world problems</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Required Materials</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n    Preprinted slips with graphs and equations\n\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Required Preparation</h3>\n<p>N/A</p>\n<br><br>\n<h3>Project Activities</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n\n\n    Activity P.1: Notice and Wonder: Sugar and Flour&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Activity P.2: Matching Matching</li>\n</ul>"
