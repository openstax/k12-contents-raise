The work here prepares students for the next activity, where they begin to think about why the values that simultaneously satisfy two equations in a system also satisfy the equation that is a sum of those two equations.</p>\n<h4>Launch</h4>\n<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. For the last question, ask each partner to come up with a new equation.</p>\n<h4>Student-Facing Statement</h4>\n<p>Look at the following equation: \\( 50 + 1 = 51 \\).</p>\n<p>1. Perform each of the following operations and answer these questions: What does each resulting equation look like? Is it still a true equation?</p>\n<div class=\"editor-indent\">\n<p>a.Add 12 to each side of the equation.<br><span>b.</span><span>Add \\(&nbsp;10 + 2&nbsp;\\) to the left side of the equation and 12 to the right side.<br></span><span>c.</span><span>Add the equation \\(&nbsp;4 + 3 = 7&nbsp;\\) to the equation \\(&nbsp;50 + 1 = 51&nbsp;\\).</span></p>\n</div>\n<p>2.

Write a new equation that, when added to \\(&nbsp;50 + 1 = 51&nbsp;\\), gives a sum that is a false equation.</p>\n<h4>Student Response</h4>\n<p>Look at the following equation: \\(&nbsp;50 + 1 = 51&nbsp;\\).</p>\n<p>1. Perform each of the following operations and answer these questions: What does each resulting equation look like? Is it still a true equation?</p>\n<div class=\"editor-indent\">\n<p>a.\\( 50 + 1 + 12 = 51 + 12\\), or \\(63 = 63 \\) (or equivalent).

Sample responses:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\\(&nbsp;8 + 2 = 10\\). Added to the original equation gives: <br>\\(&nbsp;50 + 1 + 8 + 2 = 51 + 10\\), or \\(51 + 10 = 61\\), or \\(61 = 61&nbsp;\\).<br><br></li>\n<li>\\( a + a = 2a \\). Added to the original equation gives:<br>\\(&nbsp;50 + 1 + a + a = 51 + 2a&nbsp;\\), or \\(&nbsp;51 + 2a = 51 + 2a&nbsp;\\).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>3. Sample responses:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\\(&nbsp;3 + 2 = 7&nbsp;\\). Added to the original equation gives: <br>\\(&nbsp;50 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 51 + 7&nbsp;\\), or \\(&nbsp;56 = 58&nbsp;\\), which is false.<br><br></li>\n<li>\\(&nbsp;a + 2 = a&nbsp;\\). Added to the original equation gives:<br>\\(&nbsp;50 + 1 + a + 2 = 51 + a&nbsp;\\), or \\(&nbsp;53 + a = 51 + a&nbsp;\\), which is false.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>\n<p>Ask students to share their responses to the first three questions. Discuss questions such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>&ldquo;Why do you think the resulting equations remain true even after we add numbers or expressions that look different to each side?&rdquo; (The numbers being added to the two sides are always equal amounts, even though they are written in a different form.)</li>\n<li>&ldquo;Suppose we subtract 12 from the left side of \\(&nbsp;50 + 1= 51&nbsp;\\) and subtract \\(&nbsp;5 + 7&nbsp;\\) from the right side. Would the resulting equation still be true?&rdquo; (Yes. \\(&nbsp;50 + 1 &minus; 12&nbsp;\\) is \\(&nbsp;39&nbsp;\\), and \\(&nbsp;51 &minus; (5 + 7)&nbsp;\\) is also \\(&nbsp;39&nbsp;\\). The same amount, 12, is subtracted from both sides.)</li>\n<li>&ldquo;Here is another equation: \\(&nbsp;50 + 1 = 60&nbsp;\\). Suppose we subtract 12 from the left side of that equation and \\(&nbsp;5 + 7&nbsp;\\) from the right side. Would the resulting equation still be true? Why or why not?&rdquo; (No. The given equation is a false statement. Subtracting the same amount from both sides will keep it false.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Invite students to share their equations for the last two questions. Display the equations for all to see. If no one shares an equation that uses a variable, give an example or two (as shown in the Student Responses).</p>\n<p>Make sure students understand that adding (or subtracting) the same amount to each side of a true equation keeps the two sides equal, resulting in an equation that is also true. Adding (or subtracting) different amounts to each side of a true equation, however, makes the two sides unequal and thus produces a false equation.</p>"
