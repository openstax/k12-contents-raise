You determined whether a given graph could represent a specific system of equations using your knowledge of horizontal and vertical lines and the slopes and intercepts of those lines.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>2.2.2: Checking Solutions in Systems <ul>\n      <li>In this activity, you solved different systems of equations using any method available and then checked your solution by substituting the values found back into the original equations to verify their accuracy.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>2.2.2: Self Check </li>\n  <li>2.2.3: Solving Equations Using Substitution<ul>\n      <li>In this activity, you used the substitution method to solve systems of equations. By isolating a variable in one of the equations, you found an equivalent expression that was substituted into the second equation. Using this method, the solution to one variable was found. This value was then substituted back into the first equation to find the value of the remaining unknown variable.2.2.3: Self Check</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>2.2.4: Solving More Equations<ul>\n      <li>In this activity, you continued to solve systems of equations using substitution, but you went a step further by showing your reasoning for each step in the process.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>2.2.5: Practice</li>\n</ul><br>\n<h4>Checking In&nbsp;</h4><br>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-content-id=\"21bced15-28e5-42c4-a18a-83402c204025\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n  <!--Q1-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-content-id=\"3e45c9ed-0b8c-4213-83fd-e8503a1c6c43\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n      <p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n      <p>Correct!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n      <p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!----------------- Must be included at the bottom of page for dropdown to work ------------>\n  <!--Do not edit below line.-->\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n    <!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n  </div>\n</div>"
