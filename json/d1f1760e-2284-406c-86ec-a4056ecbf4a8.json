You noticed and wondered many things about the images, the relationship between the number of people and the maximum noise level, interpreting the line of best fit, and general information about scatter plots.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>3.1.2: Creating a Scatter Plot Using Data<ul>\n<li>In this activity, you created a scatter plot from data given in context to interpret the slope and vertical intercept of the linear model and to use the linear model to make predictions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>3.1.2: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li>3.1.3: Interpreting the Slope and Vertical Intercept of a Linear Model&nbsp;<ul>\n<li>In this activity, you interpreted in context the slope and vertical intercept of a linear model given a scatter plot and the equation for a linear model that fit the data well. The linear model was also used to interpolate and extrapolate information about the data in context.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>3.1.3: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li>3.1.4: Interpreting the Slope and Vertical Intercept of a Scatter Plot<ul>\n<li>In this activity, you interpreted the slope (rate of change) and the intercept (constant term) of a linear model in the context of the data. You were given scatter plots for different pairs of variables and the equation of a line of best fit. Then you used the line of best fit and its equation to describe the meaning of the vertical intercept and slope.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>3.1.4: Self Check&nbsp;</li>\n<li>3.1.5: Using an Equation for a Fit Line&nbsp;<ul>\n<li>In this activity, you considered that we have to look at axes and demonstrate the usefulness of using an equation for a fit line, rather than sketching on a graph, to determine if the slope and \\(y\\)-intercept make sense for the linear model in the context of the problem.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>3.1.6: Practice</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Checking In&nbsp;</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<!--Q1-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n<p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<p>Correct!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!----------------- Must be included at the bottom of page for dropdown to work ------------>\n<!--Do not edit below line.-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n</div>"
