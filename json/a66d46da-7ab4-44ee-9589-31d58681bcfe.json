In the past few lessons, students worked with decontextualized quadratic functions. In this lesson, they transfer what they learned about the graphs to make sense of quadratic functions that model concrete contexts.</p>\n<p>Students interpret equations and graphs of quadratic functions in terms of the situations they represent. They use their analyses to solve problems and to compare quadratic functions given in different representations. Along the way, they practice reasoning quantitatively and abstractly.</p>\n<h4>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h4>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Interpret (orally and in writing) the graph and equation representing a function in terms of the context. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li> Explain how a quadratic equation and its graph relate to a situation. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h4>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n  <colgroup>\n    <col>\n    <col>\n  </colgroup>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>TEKS</strong></p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p><strong>Explanation of Coverage</strong></p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        <p>A7(A) graph quadratic functions on the coordinate plane and <u>use the graph to identify key attributes, if possible, including x-intercept, y-intercept, zeros, maximum value, minimum values, vertex</u>, and the equation of the axis of symmetry.</p>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <p>Partial coverage: Lesson provides content that covers part of this TEKS.
