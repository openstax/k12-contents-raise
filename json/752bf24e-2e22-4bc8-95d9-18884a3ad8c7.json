Here, they transition to solving systems algebraically&mdash;by substitution&mdash;and to reasoning about systems without context.</p>\n<p>The lesson activates and builds on what students have learned in grade 8 about solving by substitution. Students see that a system can be solved by replacing a variable with a number or with an expression and that various substitutions can be done to solve the same system. They also begin to build an awareness of the kinds of systems that are conducive to being solved by substitution.</p>\n<p>Students practice looking for and making use of structure as they identify the variables or expressions to substitute and ways to perform substitutions efficiently.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h3>\n<p>Students will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Recognize that a system can be efficiently solved by substitution if one variable is already isolated or can easily be isolated.</li>\n<li>Recognize that there are multiple ways to perform substitution to solve a system of equations.</li>\n<li>Solve systems of linear equations by substituting a variable with a number or an expression and check solutions by substituting them back into the equations.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Solve systems of equations by substituting a variable or an expression.</li>\n<li>Identify more than one way to perform substitution and decide how to substitute based on how the given equations are written.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h3>\n<strong>\n\n<div align=\"left\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col>\n<col>\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">TEKS</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Explanation of Coverage</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A.5(C) solve systems of two linear equations with two variables for mathematical and real-world problems.</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Full coverage: Lesson provides content that covers all parts of this TEKS.</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n</strong>\n<h3><span><br></span></h3>\n<h3><span>Lesson Activities</span></h3>\n<p>Here are the instructional activities for the lesson:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2.2.1: Finding Connections between Graphs and Equations</li>\n<li>2.2.2: Checking Solutions in Systems<ul>\n<li>2.2.2: Self Check</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>2.2.2: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>2.2.3: Solving Equations Using Substitution<ul>\n<li>2.2.3: Self Check</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>2.2.3: Additional Resources</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>2.2.4: Solving More Equations</li>\n</ul>\n\n<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-b8b3face-7fff-b8d3-31be-40bad0d709f7\">Students will also complete a series of problems in the 2.2.5: Practice.</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"preparation\"><br></div>\n<h3>Required Materials</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Graphing technology</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"preparation\"><br>\n<h3>Required Preparation</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Access to graphing technology available for students.</p>\n<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-97c5e2ad-7fff-039c-0d89-b4b2b8ded6eb\">\n<h3>Lesson Vocabulary</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During this lesson, it is important to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-97c5e2ad-7fff-039c-0d89-b4b2b8ded6eb\"><span>Familiarize students with the vocabulary words they will see throughout the lesson.
