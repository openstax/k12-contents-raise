They then generalized that process and learned that it is possible, and sometimes preferable, to solve for the variable before substituting known values or performing calculations.&nbsp;</div>\n  <div class=\"preparation\"><span><br></span></div>\n  <div class=\"preparation\"><span>In this lesson, they practice solving for the variable first and obtaining an expression that defines it in terms of the others. They see that doing so allows them to solve problems more efficiently.</span></div>\n  <div class=\"preparation\"><span><br></span></div>\n  <div class=\"preparation\"><span>Spreadsheets and other computer programs can help illustrate the benefits of isolating a variable. Students see that once a variable of interest is isolated and expressed in terms of all the other variables, a computer program can use that expression (even if it seems complicated) and speedily calculate its value when the other variables take on different values. The interactive model is a powerful way to test different assumptions in a situation.</span></div>\n  <div class=\"preparation\">\n    <h3>Learning Goals (Teacher Facing)</h3>\n    <p>Students will:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Practice writing equations in two or more variables and solving for a particular variable.</li>\n      <li>Solve for a variable by performing acceptable operations, including when the values of other quantities in a multi-variable equation are not known.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Learning Targets (Student Facing)</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Solve an equation for one of the variables.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</h3>\n    <div><br>\n      <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n        <caption></caption>\n        <thead>\n          <tr>\n            <th scope=\"col\">TEKS</th>\n            <th scope=\"col\">Explanation of Coverage<br></th>\n          </tr>\n        </thead>\n        <tbody>\n          <tr>\n            <td><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-4b60ea2a-7fff-7813-c1e0-6b8eade46a68\">A12(E)</span> <u>solve</u> mathematic and scientific formulas, and other <u>literal equations, for a specified variable</u></td>\n            <td><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-2189ad7b-7fff-b580-b900-8891ba3e4acd\">Partial coverage: Lesson provides content that covers part of this TEKS.
