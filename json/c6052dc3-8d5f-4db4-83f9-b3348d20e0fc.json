Explain how you know. <br>\n<br>\n<strong>Answer: </strong>\\(b\\)&nbsp;is greater than 2. Sample responses:\n        <ul>\n<li> The graph of \\(g\\) starts off being below the graph of&nbsp;\\(f\\), but later it surpasses the graph of&nbsp;\\(f\\). Since&nbsp;\\(g\\)&nbsp;grows more quickly than&nbsp;\\(f\\),&nbsp;the growth factor \\(b\\) for&nbsp;\\(g\\)&nbsp;must be greater than the growth factor for&nbsp;\\(f\\),&nbsp;which is 2. </li>\n<li> The growth factor from the first point \\((0,3)\\) to the second point \\((1,12)\\) is 4 because \\(\\frac{12}{3}=4\\), and 4 is greater than 2.<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Write an equation that defines \\(g\\). Explain your answer. <br>\n<br>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> \\(g(x)=3 \\cdot 4^x\\) because the initial value is 3 and the \\(y\\)-value is multiplied by 4 when the \\(x\\)-value increases by 1, so the growth factor is 4. <br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\\(f\\) and \\(g\\) represent the number, in thousands, of social media followers of two organizations as a function of years since 2010. What does the intersection of \\(f\\) and&nbsp;\\(g\\)&nbsp;mean in this context?&nbsp; <br>\n<br>\n<strong>Answer:</strong> It represents the time, in years since 2010, when the two organizations have the same number of followers.\n    </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>\n<h5> More Chances</h5>\n<p>Students will have more opportunities to understand the mathematical ideas in this cool-down, so there is no need to slow down or add additional work to the next lessons. Instead, use the results of this cool-down to provide guidance for what to look for and emphasize over the next several lessons to support students in advancing their current understanding.</p>"
