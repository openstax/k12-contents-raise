A local bookstore is looking for someone to help sort books and will pay <span>$</span>12.20 an hour. To get to and from the bookstore on a work day, however, Jada would have to spend <span>$</span>7.15 on bus fare. </p>\n    <ol>\n      <li>Write an equation that represents Jada&rsquo;s take-home earnings in dollars, <span>\\( E \\)</span>, if she works at the bookstore for <span>\\( h \\)</span> hours in one day.\n      </li>\n      <li>One day, Jada takes home <span>$</span>90.45 after working <span>\\( h \\)</span> hours and after paying the bus fare. Write an equation to represent this situation.\n      </li>\n      <li>Is 4 a solution to the last equation you wrote? What about 7?\n        <ul>\n          <li>If so, be prepared to explain how you know one or both of them are solutions.</li>\n          <li>If not, be prepared to explain why they are not solutions. Then, find the solution.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>In this situation, what does the solution to the equation tell us?\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n  </div>\n  <h3>Student Response</h3>\n  <div>\n    <ol>\n      <li><span>\\( E= 12.20h - 7.15 \\)</span></li>\n      <li>\n        <span>\\( 90.45 = 12.20h - 7.15 \\)</span> (or equivalent)\n      </li>\n      <li>Neither 4 nor 7 is a solution. Sample reasoning:\n        <ul>\n          <li>Substituting 4 into the equation gives <span>\\( 90.45 = 12.20(4) - 7.15 \\)</span> or <span>\\( 90.45 = 41.65 \\)</span>, which is not a true statement.</li>\n          <li>Substituting 7 into the equation gives <span>\\( 90.45 = 78.25 \\)</span>, which is also false.</li>\n          <li>The solution is 8. Substituting 8 into the equation gives <span>\\( 90.45=90.45 \\)</span>, which is true.</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>It tells us the number of hours that Jada worked that allowed her to take home <span>$</span>90.45 after paying for her bus fare.</li>\n    </ol>\n  </div>\n  <h3>Student-Facing Extension</h3>\n  <h4>Are you ready for more?</h4>\n  <div>\n    <p>Jada has a second option to earn money: she could help some neighbors with errands and computer work for <span>$</span>11 an hour. After reconsidering her schedule, Jada realizes that she has about 9 hours available to work one day of the weekend.</p>\n    <p>Which option should she choose&mdash;sorting books at the bookstore or helping her neighbors? Explain your reasoning.</p>\n  </div>\n  <h3>Extension Student Response</h3>\n  <div>\n    <p>Students could argue either way, depending on their assumptions.&nbsp;</p>\n    Sample responses:\n    <ul>\n      <li>Jada should work at the bookstore because she would earn more there. Her pay would be <span>$</span>109.80, and after subtracting <span>$</span>7.15 for the bus fare, she would still earn <span>$</span>102.65. She would earn <span>$</span>99 from the other option.</li>\n      <li>Jada should\n        help her neighbors. Working 9 hours at the bookstore would mean a few\n        more dollars than working 9 hours helping her neighbors, but it would\n        also mean losing some personal time because of the travel involved.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n  <h3>Anticipated Misconceptions</h3>\n  <div>\n    <p>If students\n      struggle to write equations in the first question, ask them how they\n      might find out Jada&rsquo;s earnings if she works 1 hour, 2 hours, 5 hours,\n      and so on. Then, ask them to generalize the computation process for <span>\\( h \\)</span> hours.</p>\n  </div>\n  <h3>Activity Synthesis</h3>\n  <div>\n    <p>Ask a student to share the equation that represents Jada earning <span>$</span>90.45. Make sure students understand why <span>\\( 90.45 = 12.20h - 7.15 \\)</span> describes that constraint. </p>\n    <p>Next, invite\n      students to share how they knew if 4 and 7 are or are not solutions to\n      the equation. Highlight that substituting those values into the equation\n      and evaluating them lead to false equations. </p>\n    <p>Then, select\n      students using different strategies to share how they found the\n      solution. Some students might notice that the solution must be greater\n      than 7 (because when <span>\\( h=7 \\)</span>, the expression <span>\\( 12.20h-7.15 \\)</span> has a value less than 90.45) and start by checking if <span>\\( h=8 \\)</span> is a solution. If no students mention this, ask them about it. </p>\n    <p>Make sure\n      students understand what the solution means in context. Emphasize that 8\n      is the number of hours that meets all the constraints in the situation.\n      Jada gets paid <span>$</span>12.20 an hour, pays <span>$</span>7.15 in bus fare, and takes home <span>$</span>90.45. For all of these to be true, she must have worked 8 hours.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <h2>1.4.2: Self-Check</h2>\n    <p><strong><em>Following the activity, students will\n          answer the following question to check their understanding of the\n          concepts explored in the activity.</em></strong></p>\n    <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td colspan=\"2\"><strong>QUESTION:</strong><br>Jada found a third job option and was offered a position working at a\n            camp for $10.50 per hour.
