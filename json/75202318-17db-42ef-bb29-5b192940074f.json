You completed mathematical statements and found the value of variables by reading the information from a graph.</li>\n</ul>\n<li>4.6.2: Analyzing Graphs of Functions</li>\n<ul>\n<li>In this activity, you looked at the graphs of two different real-life functions. You identified key features such as minimum and maximum, \\(x\\)-intercepts and \\(y\\)-intercepts, and what they mean in a real-life situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<li>4.6.2: Self Check</li>\n<li>4.6.3: Connecting Graphical and Verbal Representations of a Function</li>\n<ul>\n<li>In this activity, you continued working with graphs, function notation, and real-life situations. You interpreted statements about a real-life graph and connected them to the function notation that represented them.</li>\n</ul>\n<li>4.6.3: Self Check</li>\n<li>4.6.4: Key Features of Linear Functions</li>\n<ul>\n<li>In this activity, you recognized the \\(x\\)-intercepts, zeros, slope, and \\(y\\)-intercepts of linear functions.</li>\n</ul>\n<li>4.6.4: Self Check</li>\n<li>4.6.5: Interpreting Graphs</li>\n<ul>\n<li>In this activity, you examined specific points and key features on the graph and interpreted their meaning verbally and algebraically.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>After these activities, you completed the following <strong>practice</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4.6.6: Practice</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Checking In</h4>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset\" data-button-text=\"Submit\" data-fire-learning-opportunity-event=\"eventnameY\" data-fire-success-event=\"eventnameX\" data-retry-limit=\"1\" data-schema-version=\"1.0\">\n<!--pulldown-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem\" data-problem-type=\"dropdown\" data-solution data-solution-options='[\"1 - I&rsquo;m totally lost!\", \"2 - I could use some more help.\", \"3 - I mostly understand.\", \"4 - I can do it.\",\"5 - I&rsquo;ve got this!\"]'>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-problem-content\">\n<p>On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel about the learning goals of this lesson? </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<p>Correct!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve answered 3 or less, be sure to reach out to your teacher before starting the next lesson.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!--Do not edit below line.-->\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-correct-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n<div class=\"os-raise-ib-pset-encourage-response\">\n<!-- INSERT ANY VALID HTML HERE -->\n</div>\n</div>"
