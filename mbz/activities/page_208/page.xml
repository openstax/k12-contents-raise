    <name>Unit 6, Section B Overview: Factoring Polynomials</name>
    <intro/>
    <introformat>1</introformat>
    <content>&lt;p&gt;Ozzy Gamez and Juan Quezada opened Plant Shop Chicago, a place where people can come to find unique indoor plants and enjoy nature. To make sure their business runs smoothly, they must keep track of costs and revenue. Polynomials can be used to represent cost and revenue, and understanding how to work with polynomials can help Ozzy and Juan make decisions, such as how much to charge for their products to maximize profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, you will learn to factor expressions and polynomials. In the first lesson of this section, you will learn to find the GCF, greatest common factor, of expressions, as you have previously learned using numbers. You will learn to factor using the GCF and the &amp;ldquo;reverse&amp;rdquo; of the Distributive Property. In the next three lessons of the unit, you will learn multiple ways to factor trinomials and special products. In the last lesson of the unit, you will look for patterns and assess the form of polynomials to select an appropriate strategy for factoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section includes 4 lessons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Greatest Common Factor and Factor by Grouping &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Factor Trinomials &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Factor Special Products &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; General Strategy for Factoring Polynomials &lt;/li&gt;
