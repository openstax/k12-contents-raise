    <content>&lt;p&gt;The arc of the water shot by SafeRain jets and fountains can be modeled using quadratic equations. Knowing the exact height and distance the water will travel is integral to accurately design their beautiful water displays. SafeRain coordinates the shapes of the water arcs with precise timing to create impressive works of art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, you will explore problems that are not easily solved by previously learned strategies. By using the given context of a problem and extrapolating missing measurements, you will construct quadratic equations to model these problems. You will also interpret the meaning of the solutions to these equations given the context of the problem. Through continued exploration of these quadratic equations, you will learn that a precise solution cannot always be determined by graphing or reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section includes two lessons:&lt;/p&gt;
