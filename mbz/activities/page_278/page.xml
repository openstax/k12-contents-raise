    <content>&lt;p&gt;Juan David Crespo and the SafeRain Technical Department use their knowledge of quadratic equations to calculate the path of the water shot by their jets and fountains. By solving these quadratic equations, they can determine how long it would take for a burst of water to travel up from a jet and back down to the surface of the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, you will continue to model real-world problems using quadratic equations. You will see that writing and solving quadratic equations enables you to find input values that produce certain output values. You will solve quadratic equations in their factored form using the zero product property. You will also rewrite quadratic equations from their standard form into their factored form so that you can find their zeros, or solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section includes eight lessons:&lt;/p&gt;
