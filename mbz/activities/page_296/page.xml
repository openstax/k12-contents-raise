    <content>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, to solve a real-world problem, you need to work backward to find the information you need. You may have a complete data set, such as a set of distances traveled by a water arc or the height of targets for the water to hit. It is possible to use this information to create a quadratic model to represent the situation. This model can then be used to make predictions about how the water might behave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, you will continue translating quadratic equations between their factored form, standard form, intercept form, and solutions. You will analyze related quadratic functions that share the same zeros, or solutions, and axis of symmetry. You will use graphing technology to analyze data sets to identify a curve of best fit. This curve will be used to make accurate predictions about a situation given its real-world context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section includes two lessons:&lt;/p&gt;
