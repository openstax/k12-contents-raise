NARRATOR: Nafy Flatley founded
a company called TERANGA

00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:05.372 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:58%
to bring healthy drinks
and snacks

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:08.975 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:70%
that are inspired by her
native Senegal to the world.

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.578 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:63%
Teranga means hospitality
in Wolof,

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:13.613 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:53%
the national language
of Senegal.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.550 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:70%
It is more than just a word.
Teranga is a way of life.

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:20.220 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:73%
It is about accepting others,
welcoming them,

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:22.255 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:70%
and treating them as family.

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:24.991 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:63%
How does TERANGA
come up with snack mixes?

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.761 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:68%
It's not as simple as
just combining ingredients.

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:30.196 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:70%
They have a lot to consider,
such as:

00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:32.198 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:78%
What ingredients they will use?

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:34.501 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:53%
How much does
each ingredient cost?

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:37.103 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:78%
What are the nutritional values
of each ingredient?

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.006 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:55%
How much does
each ingredient weigh?

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:43.042 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:63%
Some nuts and dried fruit
are cheaper than others,

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:46.312 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:73%
and every ingredient has
different nutritional values.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.282 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:73%
So figuring out the right mix
isn't easy.

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:51.851 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:48%
How can TERANGA
satisfy every goal?

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:55.288 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:78%
If they can translate each goal
into a linear inequality,

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:56.689 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:68%
then they can use some math

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:59.092 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:55%
to find mixes
that meet their goals.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.629 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:68%
So let's say each bag
needs the following things.

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:04.898 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:43%
Contains almonds,
dried apricots,

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:06.599 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:45%
and dried bananas.

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.768 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:70%
Costs less than ten dollars.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:10.236 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:43%
Weighs one pound.

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:13.606 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:65%
Has less than 500 calories
per serving.

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:17.410 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:80%
Has between ten and twenty grams
of protein per serving.

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:18.678 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:65%
These are the constraints,

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:22.916 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:73%
and each one can be expressed
as a linear inequality.

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:25.051 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:50%
By using these
linear inequalities,

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:27.887 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:60%
TERANGA's team can know
exactly what combination

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:30.190 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:45%
of fruits and nuts
to put into a mix

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:31.891 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:70%
that will not only be tasty,

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.894 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:68%
but will also be nutritious
and affordable.

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:38.598 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:65%
Oh, and the mix will make
the company a nice profit.

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:41.367 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:73%
Without math,
TERANGA might create products

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:43.937 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:55%
that are too expensive
and not as healthy.

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:46.039 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:43%
Math and TERANGA,

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:48.942 align:middle line:95% position:50% size:75%
two things that make the world
a better place.
