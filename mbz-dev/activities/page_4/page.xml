    <content>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;About&lt;/h4&gt;This course is based on materials created by &lt;a href="https://illustrativemathematics.org/"&gt;Illustrative Mathematics&lt;/a&gt; (IM) and &lt;a href="https://openstax.org/"&gt;OpenStax&lt;/a&gt;, as well as structure and elements created by Wisewire.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="main"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="main"&gt;Each unit contains between 10 and 25 lessons, which include printable lesson plans as well as online resources to support student learning. Each unit has a diagnostic assessment for the beginning of the unit and an end-of-unit assessment. In addition to lessons and assessments, modeling prompts are provided to be used throughout the year.&lt;br&gt;The time estimates in these materials refer to instructional time. Each lesson plan is designed to fit within a class period that is at least 45 minutes long. Some lessons contain optional activities that provide additional scaffolding or practice for teachers to use at their discretion.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="main"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="main"&gt;Because the course includes media and digital interactive tools, students should have access to a device that can access their view of the course. It is recommended that if students are to access the materials on a digital device, they keep a carefully organized notebook so that they can go back to their work later.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="main"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="main"&gt;Teachers can access the teacher materials in a browser. A classroom with a digital projector is recommended.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="main"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="main"&gt;Many activities are written in a card sort, matching, or info gap format that requires teachers to provide students with a set of cards or slips of paper that have been photocopied and cut up ahead of time. Teachers might stock up on two sizes of resealable plastic bags: sandwich size and gallon size. For a given activity, one set of cards can go in each small bag, and then the small bags for one class can be placed in a large bag. If these are labeled and stored in an organized manner, it can facilitate preparing ahead of time and re-using card sets between classes. Additionally, if possible, it is often helpful to print the slips for different parts of an activity on different color paper. This helps facilitate quickly sorting the cards between classes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="main"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="main"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For additional information, see &lt;a href="@@PLUGINFILE@@/About%20the%20Curriculum.docx"&gt;this document&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
