&lt;h4&gt;About&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These materials were created by Illustrative Mathematics. They were piloted and revised in the 2018-2019 school year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Units contain between 10 and 25 lesson plans. Each unit has a diagnostic assessment for the beginning of the unit (&lt;em&gt;Check Your Readiness&lt;/em&gt;) and an end-of-unit assessment. Longer units also have a mid-unit assessment. In addition to lesson and assessments, modeling prompts are provided to be used throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time estimates in these materials refer to instructional time. Each lesson plan is designed to fit within a class period that is at least 45 minutes long. Some lessons contain optional activities that provide additional scaffolding or practice for teachers to use at their discretion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways students can interact with these materials. Students can work solely with printed workbooks or pdfs. Alternatively, if all students have access to an appropriate device, students can look at the task statements on that device and write their responses in a notebook or the print companion for the digital materials. It is recommended that if students are to access the materials this way, they keep the notebook carefully organized so that they can go back to their work later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers can access the teacher materials either in print or in a browser. A classroom with a digital projector is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many activities are written in a card sort, matching, or info gap format that requires teachers to provide students with a set of cards or slips of paper that have been photocopied and cut up ahead of time. Teachers might stock up on two sizes of resealable plastic bags: sandwich size and gallon size. For a given activity, one set of cards can go in each small bag, and then the small bags for one class can be placed in a large bag. If these are labeled and stored in an organized manner, it can facilitate preparing ahead of time and re-using card sets between classes. Additionally, if possible, it is often helpful to print the slips for different parts of an activity on different color paper. This helps facilitate quickly sorting the cards between classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Design Principles&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Developing Conceptual Understanding and Procedural Fluency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each unit begins with a pre-assessment that helps teachers gauge what students know about both prerequisite and upcoming concepts and skills, so that teachers can gauge where students are and make adjustments accordingly. The initial lesson in a unit is designed to activate prior knowledge and provide an entry point to new concepts, so that students at different levels of both mathematical and English language proficiency can engage productively in the work. As the unit progresses, students are systematically introduced to representations, contexts, concepts, language and notation. As their learning progresses, they make connections between different representations and strategies, consolidating their conceptual understanding, and see and understand more efficient methods of solving problems, supporting the shift towards procedural fluency. Practice problems, when assigned in a distributed manner, give students ongoing practice, which also supports developing procedural proficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Applying Mathematics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students have opportunities to make connections to real-world contexts throughout the materials. Frequently, carefully-chosen anchor contexts are used to motivate new mathematical concepts, and students have many opportunities to make connections between contexts and the concepts they are learning. Many units include a real-world application lesson at the end. In some cases, students spend more time developing mathematical concepts before tackling more complex application problems, and the focus is on mathematical contexts. Additionally, a set of mathematical modeling prompts provide students opportunities to engage in authentic, grade-level appropriate mathematical modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Use of Digital Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These curriculum materials empower high school teachers and students to become fluent users of widely-accessible mathematical digital tools to produce representations to support their understanding, solve problems, and communicate their reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital tools are included when they are required by the standard being addressed and when they make better learning possible. For example, when a student can use a graphing calculator instead of graphing by hand, use a spreadsheet instead of repeating calculations, or create dynamic geometry drawings instead of making multiple hand-drawn sketches, they can attend to the structure of the mathematics or the meaning of the representation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons are written with three anticipated levels of digital interaction: some activities &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; digital tools, some activities &lt;em&gt;suggest&lt;/em&gt; digital tools, and some activities &lt;em&gt;allow&lt;/em&gt; digital tools. In a few cases, activities may prohibit digital tools if they interfere with concept development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases, instead of being given a pre-made applet to explore, students have access to a suite of linked applications, such as graphing tools, synthetic and analytic geometry tools, and spreadsheets. Students (and teachers) are taught how to use the tools, but not always told when to use them, and student choice in problem-solving approach is valued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When appropriate, pre-made applets may be included to allow for students to practice many iterations of a skill with error checking, to shorten the amount of time it takes students to create a representation, or to help students see many examples of a relationship in a short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Five Practices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selected activities are structured using Five Practices for Orchestrating Productive Mathematical Discussions (Smith &amp; Stein, 2011), also described in Principles to Actions: Ensuring Mathematical Success for All (NCTM, 2014), and Intentional Talk: How to Structure and Lead Productive Mathematical Discussions (Kazemi &amp; Hintz, 2014). These activities include a presentation of a task or problem (may be print or other media) where student approaches are anticipated ahead of time. Students first engage in independent think-time followed by partner or small-group work on the problem. The teacher circulates as students are working and notes groups using different approaches. Groups or individuals are selected in a specific, recommended sequence to share their approach with the class, and finally the teacher leads a whole-class discussion to make connections and highlight important ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Task Purposes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide experience with a new context. Activities that give all students experience with a new context ensure that students are ready to make sense of the concrete before encountering the abstract. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Introduce a new concept and associated language. Activities that introduce a new concept and associated language build on what students already know and ask them to notice or put words to something new. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Introduce a new representation. Activities that introduce a new representation often present the new representation of a familiar idea first and ask students to interpret it. Where appropriate, new representations are connected to familiar representations or extended from familiar representations. Students are then given clear instructions on how to create such a representation as a tool for understanding or for solving problems. For subsequent activities and lessons, students are given opportunities to practice using these representations and to choose which representation to use for a particular problem.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Formalize a definition of a term for an idea previously encountered informally. Activities that formalize a definition take a concept that students have already encountered through examples, and give it a more general definition. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Identify and resolve common mistakes and misconceptions that people make. Activities that give students a chance to identify and resolve common mistakes and misconceptions usually present some incorrect work and ask students to identify it as such and explain what is incorrect about it. Students deepen their understanding of key mathematical concepts as they analyze and critique the reasoning of others.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Practice using mathematical language. Activities that provide an opportunity to practice using mathematical language are focused on that as the primary goal rather than having a primarily mathematical learning goal. They are intended to give students a reason to use mathematical language to communicate. These frequently use the Info Gap instructional routine.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Work toward mastery of a concept or procedure. Activities where students work toward mastery are included for topics where experience shows students often need some additional time to work with the ideas. Often these activities are marked as optional because no new mathematics is covered, so if a teacher were to skip them, no new topics would be missed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Provide an opportunity to apply mathematics to a modeling or other application problem. Activities that provide an opportunity to apply mathematics to a modeling or other application problem are most often found toward the end of a unit. Their purpose is to give students experience using mathematics to reason about a problem or situation that one might encounter naturally outside of a mathematics classroom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A note about standards alignments: &lt;/em&gt;There are three kinds of alignments to standards in these materials: building on, addressing, and building towards. Oftentimes a particular standard requires weeks, months, or years to achieve, in many cases building on work in prior grade levels. When an activity reflects the work of prior grades but is being used to bridge to a grade-level standard, alignments are indicated as "building on." When an activity is laying the foundation for a grade-level standard but has not yet reached the level of the standard, the alignment is indicated as "building towards." When a task is focused on the grade-level work, the alignment is indicated as "addressing."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A note about mathematical diagrams: &lt;/em&gt;Everything in a mathematical diagram has a mathematical meaning. Students are sense makers looking for connections. The mathematical diagrams provided in activities were designed to include only components with mathematical meaning. For example, while it is not uncommon to see arrows on the ends of a graph of a function, the arrows add no mathematical meaning to the graph. Arrows are typically used to imply a sense of direction, but a graph of a function is representation of all the points that make the function true, so there is no direction to imply. It is also possible for students to infer meaning that isn't there, such as assuming the arrows mean the function continues forever in a specific direction. While this idea works for linear functions, it does not work with functions whose graphs curve or are periodic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is a Problem-Based Curriculum?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Students Should Know and Be Able to Do&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ultimate purpose is to impact student learning and achievement. First, we define the attitudes and beliefs about mathematics and mathematics learning we want to cultivate in students, and what mathematics students should know and be able to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Attitudes and Beliefs We Want to Cultivate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people think that mathematical knowledge and skills exclusively belong to "math people." Yet research shows that students who believe that hard work is more important than innate talent learn more mathematics.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; We want students to believe anyone can do mathematics and that persevering at mathematics will result in understanding and success. In the words of the NRC report Adding It Up, we want students to develop a "productive disposition-[the] habitual inclination to see mathematics as sensible, useful, and worthwhile, coupled with a belief in diligence and one's own efficacy."&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Uttal, D.H. (1997). Beliefs about genetic influences on mathematics achievement: a cross-cultural comparison. &lt;em&gt;Genetica&lt;/em&gt;, 99(2-3), 165-172. doi.org/10.1023/A:1018318822120&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; National Research Council. (2001). &lt;em&gt;Adding it up: Helping children learn mathematics&lt;/em&gt;. J.Kilpatrick, J. Swafford, and B.Findell (Eds.). Mathematics Learning Study Committee, Center for Education, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education. Washington, DC: National Academy Press. doi.org/10.17226/9822&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conceptual understanding&lt;/em&gt;: Students need to understand the why behind the how in mathematics. Concepts build on experience with concrete contexts. Students should access these concepts from a number of perspectives in order to see math as more than a set of disconnected procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Procedural fluency&lt;/em&gt;: We view procedural fluency as solving problems expected by the standards with speed, accuracy, and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Application&lt;/em&gt;: Application means applying mathematical or statistical concepts and skills to a novel mathematical or real-world context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three aspects of mathematical proficiency are interconnected: procedural fluency is supported by understanding, and deep understanding often requires procedural fluency. In order to be successful in applying mathematics, students must both understand and be able to do the mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Mathematical Practices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a mathematics class, students should not just learn &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; mathematics, they should &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; mathematics. This can be defined as engaging in the mathematical practices: making sense of problems, reasoning abstractly and quantitatively, making arguments and critiquing the reasoning of others, modeling with mathematics, making appropriate use of tools, attending to precision in their use of language, looking for and making use of structure, and expressing regularity in repeated reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What Teaching and Learning Should Look Like&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How teachers should teach depends on what we want students to learn. To understand what teachers need to know and be able to do, we need to understand how students develop the different (but intertwined) strands of mathematical proficiency, and what kind of instructional moves support that development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Principles for Mathematics Teaching and Learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Active learning is best&lt;/em&gt;: Students learn best and retain what they learn better by solving problems. Often, mathematics instruction is shaped by the belief that if teachers tell students how to solve problems and then students practice, students will learn how to do mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="2 pictures of teacher roles" height="259" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/im-ims-export/WEnrAh5d9JYcjqMYY4my82sB" width="619" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decades of research tells us that the traditional model of instruction is flawed. Traditional instructional methods may get short-term results with procedural skills, but students tend to forget the procedural skills and do not develop problem solving skills, deep conceptual understanding, or a mental framework for how ideas fit together. They also don't develop strategies for tackling non-routine problems, including a propensity for engaging in productive struggle to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to learn mathematics, students should spend time in math class &lt;em&gt;doing mathematics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Students learn mathematics as a result of solving problems. Mathematical ideas are the outcomes of the problem-solving experience rather than the elements that must be taught before problem solving."&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students should take an active role, both individually and in groups, to see what they can figure out before having things explained to them or being told what to do. Teachers play a critical role in mediating student learning, but that role looks different than simply showing, telling, and correcting. The teacher's role is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;to ensure students understand the context and what is being asked&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;ask questions to advance students' thinking in productive ways&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;help students share their work and understand others' work through orchestrating productive discussions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;synthesize the learning with students at the end of activities and lessons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="4 Pictures of different teacher roles" height="406" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/im-ims-export/TKRNZgaH1h3eoGnBc23ceszu" width="780" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teachers should build on what students know&lt;/em&gt;: New mathematical ideas are built on what students already know about mathematics and the world, and as they learn new ideas, students need to make connections between them.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; In order to do this, teachers need to understand what knowledge students bring to the classroom and monitor what they do and do not understand as they are learning. Teachers must themselves know how the mathematical ideas connect in order to mediate students' learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good instruction starts with explicit learning goals&lt;/em&gt;: Learning goals must be clear not only to teachers, but also to students, and they must influence the activities in which students participate. Without a clear understanding of what students should be learning, activities in the classroom, implemented haphazardly, have little impact on advancing students' understanding. Strategic negotiation of whole-class discussion on the part of the teacher during an activity synthesis is crucial to making the intended learning goals explicit. Teachers need to have a clear idea of the destination for the day, week, month, and year, and select and sequence instructional activities (or use well-sequenced materials) that will get the class to their destinations. If you are going to a party, you need to know the address and also plan a route to get there; driving around aimlessly will not get you where you need to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Different learning goals require different instructional moves&lt;/em&gt;: The kind of instruction that is appropriate at any given time depends on the learning goals of a particular lesson. Lessons and activities can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduce students to a new topic of study and invite them to the mathematics.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Study new concepts and procedures deeply.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Integrate and connect representations, concepts, and procedures.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Work towards mastery.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Apply mathematics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lessons should be designed based on what the intended learning outcomes are. This means that teachers should have a toolbox of instructional moves that they can use as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each and every student should have access to the mathematical work&lt;/em&gt;: With proper structures, accommodations, and supports, all students can learn mathematics. Teachers' instructional toolboxes should include knowledge of and skill in implementing supports for different learners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Hiebert, J., et. al. (1996). Problem solving as a basis for reform in curriculum and instruction: the case of mathematics. &lt;em&gt;Educational Researcher&lt;/em&gt; 25(4), 12-21. doi.org/10.3102/0013189X025004012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; National Research Council. (2001). &lt;em&gt;Adding it up: Helping children learn mathematics&lt;/em&gt;. J.Kilpatrick, J. Swafford, and B.Findell (Eds.). Mathematics Learning Study Committee, Center for Education, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education. Washington, DC: National Academy Press. doi.org/10.17226/9822&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Critical Practices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intentional planning&lt;/em&gt;: Because different learning goals require different instructional moves, teachers need to be able to plan their instruction appropriately. While a high-quality curriculum does reduce the burden for teachers to create or curate lessons and tasks, it does not reduce the need to spend deliberate time planning lessons and tasks. Instead, teachers' planning time can shift to high-leverage practices (practices that teachers without a high-quality curriculum often report wishing they had more time for): reading and understanding the high-quality curriculum materials; identifying connections to prior and upcoming work; diagnosing students' readiness to do the work; leveraging instructional routines to address different student needs and differentiate instruction; anticipating student responses that will be important to move the learning forward; planning questions and prompts that will help students attend to, make sense of, and learn from each other's work; planning supports and extensions to give as many students as possible access to the main mathematical goals; figuring out timing, pacing, and opportunities for practice; preparing necessary supplies; and the never-ending task of giving feedback on student work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Establishing norms&lt;/em&gt;: Norms around doing math together and sharing understandings play an important role in the success of a problem-based curriculum. For example, students must feel safe taking risks, listen to each other, disagree respectfully, and honor equal air time when working together in groups. Establishing norms helps teachers cultivate a community of learners where making thinking visible is both expected and valued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Building a shared understanding of a small set of instructional routines&lt;/em&gt;: Instructional routines allow the students and teacher to become familiar with the classroom choreography and what they are expected to do. This means that they can pay less attention to what they are supposed to do and more attention to the mathematics to be learned. Routines can provide a structure that helps strengthen students' skills in communicating their mathematical ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using high quality curriculum&lt;/em&gt;: A growing body of evidence suggests that using a high-quality, coherent curriculum can have a significant impact on student learning.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Creating a coherent, effective instructional sequence from the ground up takes significant time, effort, and expertise. Teaching is already a full-time job, and adding curriculum development on top of that means teachers are overloaded or shortchanging their students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ongoing formative assessment&lt;/em&gt;: Teachers should know what mathematics their students come into the classroom already understanding, and use that information to plan their lessons. As students work on problems, teachers should ask questions to better understand students' thinking, and use expected student responses and potential misconceptions to build on students' mathematical understanding during the lesson. Teachers should monitor what their students have learned at the end of the lesson and use this information to provide feedback and plan further instruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Steiner, D. (2017). Curriculum research: What we know and where we need to go. &lt;em&gt;Standards Work&lt;/em&gt;. Retrieved from https://standardswork.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/sw-curriculum-research-report-fnl.pdf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A Typical IM Lesson&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note about optional activities: A relatively small number of activities throughout the course have been marked "optional." Some common reasons an activity might be optional include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The activity addresses a concept or skill that is below grade level, but we know that it is common for students to need a chance to focus on it before encountering grade-level material. If the pre-unit diagnostic assessment (&lt;em&gt;Check Your Readiness&lt;/em&gt;) indicates that students don't need this review, an activity like this can be safely skipped.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The activity addresses a concept or skill that goes beyond the requirements of a standard. The activity is nice to do if there is time, but students won't miss anything important if the activity is skipped.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The activity provides an opportunity for additional practice on a concept or skill that we know many students (but not necessarily all students) need. Teachers should use their judgment about whether class time is needed for such an activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical lesson has four phases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;a warm-up&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;one or more instructional activities&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;the lesson synthesis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;a cool-down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Warm-Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first event in every lesson is a warm-up. A warm-up either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;helps students get ready for the day's lesson, or&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;gives students an opportunity to strengthen their number sense or procedural fluency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A warm-up that helps students get ready for today's lesson might serve to remind them of a context they have seen before, get them thinking about where the previous lesson left off, or preview a calculation that will happen in the lesson so that the calculation doesn't get in the way of learning new mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A warm-up that is meant to strengthen number sense or procedural fluency asks students to do mental arithmetic, or reason numerically or algebraically. It gives them a chance to make deeper connections or become more flexible in their thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructional routines frequently used in warm-ups are Number Talks, Notice and Wonder, and Which One Doesn't Belong. In addition to the mathematical purposes, these routines serve the additional purpose of strengthening students' skills in listening and speaking about mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once students and teachers become used to the routine, warm-ups should take 5-10 minutes. If warm-ups frequently take much longer than that, the teacher should work on concrete moves to more efficiently accomplish the goal of the warm-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year, consider establishing a small, discreet hand signal students can display to indicate they have an answer they can support with reasoning. This signal could be a thumbs up, or students could show the number of fingers that indicate the number of responses they have for the problem. This is a quick way to see if students have had enough time to think about the problem and keep them from being distracted or rushed by classmates' raised hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Classroom Activities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the warm-up, lessons consist of a sequence of one or more classroom activities. The activities are the heart of the mathematical experience and make up the majority of the time spent in class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An activity can serve one or more of many purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide experience with a new context.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Introduce a new concept and associated language.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Introduce a new representation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Formalize a definition of a term for an idea previously encountered informally.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Identify and resolve common mistakes and misconceptions that people make.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Practice using mathematical language.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Work toward mastery of a concept or procedure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Provide an opportunity to apply mathematics to a modeling or other application problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of each activity is described in its activity narrative. Read more about how activities serve these different purposes in the section on design principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Lesson Synthesis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the activities for the day are done, students should take time to synthesize what they have learned. This portion of class should take 5-10 minutes before students start working on the cool-down. Each lesson includes a lesson synthesis section that assists the teacher with ways to help students incorporate new insights gained during the activities into their big-picture understanding. Teachers can use this time in any number of ways, including posing questions verbally and calling on volunteers to respond, asking students to respond to prompts in a written journal, asking students to add on to a graphic organizer or concept map, or adding a new component to a persistent display like a word wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cool-Down&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each lesson includes a cool-down task to be given to students at the end of the lesson. Students are meant to work on the cool-down for about 5 minutes independently and turn it in. The cool-down serves as a brief formative assessment to determine whether students understood the lesson. Students' responses to the cool-down can be used to make adjustments to further instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Guidance for Accelerating Students in Mathematics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Each Lesson and Unit Tells a Story&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of each course is told in 7 or 8 units. Each unit has a narrative that describes the mathematical work that will unfold in that unit. Each lesson in the unit also has a narrative. Lesson Narratives explain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A description of the mathematical content of the lesson and its place in the learning sequence.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The meaning of any new terms introduced in the lesson.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How the mathematical practices come into play, as appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activities within lessons also have a narrative, which explain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The mathematical purpose of the activity and its place in the learning sequence.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What students are doing during the activity.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What teacher needs to look for while students are working on an activity to orchestrate an effective synthesis.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Connections to the mathematical practices when appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Launch - Work - Synthesize&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each classroom activity has three phases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Launch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the launch, the teacher makes sure that students understand the context (if there is one) and &lt;em&gt;what the problem is asking them to do&lt;/em&gt;. This is not the same as making sure the students know &lt;em&gt;how to do the problem&lt;/em&gt;-part of the work that students should be doing for themselves is figuring out how to solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Student Work Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launch for an activity frequently includes suggestions for grouping students. This gives students the opportunity to work individually, with a partner, or in small groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Activity Synthesis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the activity synthesis, the teacher orchestrates some time for students to synthesize what they have learned. This time is used to ensure that all students have an opportunity to understand the mathematical goal of the activity and situate the new learning within students' previous understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Practice Problems&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each lesson includes an associated set of practice problems. Teachers may decide to assign practice problems for homework or for extra practice in class. They may decide to collect and score it or to provide students with answers ahead of time for self-assessment. It is up to teachers to decide which problems to assign (including assigning none at all).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practice problem set associated with each lesson includes a few questions about the contents of that lesson, plus additional problems that review material from earlier in the unit and previous units. Distributed practice (revisiting the same content over time) is more effective than massed practice (a large amount of practice on one topic, but all at once). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Are You Ready For More?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select classroom activities include an opportunity for differentiation for students ready for more of a challenge. We think of them as the "mathematical dessert" to follow the "mathematical entrée" of a classroom activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every extension problem is made available to all students with the heading "Are You Ready for More?" These problems go deeper into grade-level mathematics and often make connections between the topic at hand and other concepts. Some of these problems extend the work of the associated activity, but some of them involve work from prior grades, prior units in the course, or reflect work that is related to the K-12 curriculum but a type of problem not required by the standards. They are not routine or procedural, and they are not just "the same thing again but with harder numbers."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are intended to be used on an opt-in basis by students if they finish the main class activity early or want to do more mathematics on their own. It is not expected that an entire class engages in &lt;em&gt;Are You Ready for More? &lt;/em&gt;problems, and it is not expected that any student works on all of them. &lt;em&gt;Are You Ready for More?&lt;/em&gt; problems may also be good fodder for a Problem of the Week or similar structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Instructional Routines&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind of instruction appropriate in any particular lesson depends on the learning goals of that lesson. Some lessons may be devoted to developing a concept, others to mastering a procedural skill, yet others to applying mathematics to a real-world problem. These aspects of mathematical proficiency are interwoven. These materials include a small set of activity structures and reference a small, high-leverage set of teacher moves that become more and more familiar to teachers and students as the year progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first instance of each routine in a course includes more detailed guidance for how to successfully conduct the routine. Subsequent instances include more abbreviated guidance, so as not to unnecessarily inflate the word count of the teacher guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Routines&lt;/em&gt; indicate required or suggested applications of technology, appearing repeatedly throughout the curriculum. Activities using the routines are flagged for the teacher, which is helpful for lesson planning and for focusing the work of professional development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the instructional routines, known as Mathematical Language Routines (MLR), were developed by the Stanford University UL/SCALE team. The purpose of each MLR is described here, but you can read more about supports for students with emerging English language proficiency in the Supporting English Language Learners section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please access &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XqHcZsfQoHwWrhn77V3sj_jOL4www2TR9u0IKEfQB4U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;this sheet [link]&lt;/a&gt; to see all locations of each routine in the curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Analyze It&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyze It indicates activities where students have an opportunity to use statistical tools to calculate and display numeric statistics and produce visual representations of one- and two-variable data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Anticipate, Monitor, Select, Sequence, Connect&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What: These are the &lt;em&gt;5 Practices for Orchestrating Productive Mathematical Discussions&lt;/em&gt; (Smith and Stein, 2011). In this curriculum, much of the work of anticipating, sequencing, and connecting is handled by the materials in the activity narrative, launch, and synthesis sections. Teachers need to prepare for and conduct whole-class discussions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where: Many classroom activities lend themselves to this structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why: In a problem-based curriculum, many activities can be described as "do math and talk about it," but the 5 Practices lend more structure to these activities so that they more reliably result in students making connections and learning new mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Aspects of Mathematical Modeling&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What: In activities tagged with this routine, students engage in scaled-back modeling scenarios, for which students only need to engage in a part of a full modeling cycle. For example, they may be selecting quantities of interest in a situation or choosing a model from a list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why: Mathematical modeling is often new territory for both students and teachers. Opportunities to develop discrete skills in the supported environment of a classroom lesson make success more likely when students engage in more open-ended modeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Card Sort&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What: A Card Sort uses cards or slips of paper that can be manipulated and moved around (or the same functionality enacted with a computer interface). It can be done individually or in groups of 2-4. Students put things into categories or groups based on shared characteristics or connections. This routine can be combined with Take Turns, such that each time a student sorts a card into a category or makes a match, they are expected to explain the rationale while the group listens for understanding. The first few times students engage in these activities, the teacher should demonstrate how the activity is expected to go. Once students are familiar with these structures, less set-up will be necessary. While students are working, the teacher can ask students to restate their question more clearly or paraphrase what their partner said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where: Classroom Activities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why: A Card Sort provides opportunities to attend to mathematical connections using representations that are already created, instead of expending time and effort generating representations. It gives students opportunities to analyze representations, statements, and structures closely and make connections (MP2, MP7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Extend It&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extend It indicates activities where students have an opportunity to use a spreadsheet to produce a sequence of numbers to see patterns and make predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Fit It&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fit It indicates activities where students have an opportunity to use a table of points to produce a graph to see patterns and make predictions. Also when appropriate, find a function that best fits the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Graph It&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graph It indicates activities where students have an opportunity to use graphing technology to visualize a graph representing one or more functions with known parameters and use the tool to find features like intersection points, intercepts, and maximums or minimums. Additionally, they may use sliders for exploring the effect of changing parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Math Talk&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What: In these warm-ups, one problem is displayed at a time. Students are given a few moments to quietly think and give a signal when they have an answer and a strategy. The teacher selects students to share different strategies for each problem, asking, "Who thought about it a different way?" Their explanations are recorded for all to see. Students might be pressed to provide more details about why they decided to approach a problem a certain way. It may not be possible to share every possible strategy in the given time-the teacher may only gather two or three distinctive strategies per problem. Problems are purposefully chosen to elicit different approaches, often in a way that builds from one problem to the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why: Math Talks build fluency by encouraging students to think about the numbers, shapes, or algebraic expressions and rely on what they know about structure, patterns, and properties of operations to mentally solve a problem. While participating in these activities, students need to be precise in their word choice and use of language (MP6). Additionally a Math Talk often provides opportunities to notice and make use of structure (MP7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;MLR1: Stronger and Clearer Each Time&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;To provide a structured and interactive opportunity for students to revise and refine both their ideas and their verbal and written output. This routine provides a purpose for student conversation as well as fortifies output. The main idea is to have students think or write individually about a response, use a structured pairing strategy to have multiple opportunities to refine and clarify the response through conversation, and then finally revise their original written response. Throughout this process, students should be pressed for details, and encouraged to press each other for details.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;MLR2: Collect and Display&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;To capture students' oral words and phrases into a stable, collective reference. The intent of this routine is to stabilize the fleeting language that students use during partner, small-group, or whole-class activities in order for student's own output to be used as a reference in developing their mathematical language. The teacher listens for, and scribes, the student output using written words, diagrams and pictures; this collected output can be organized, revoiced, or explicitly connected to other language in a display for all students to use. This routine provides feedback for students in a way that increases accessibility while simultaneously supporting meta-awareness of language.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;MLR3: Clarify, Critique, Correct&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give students a piece of mathematical writing that is not their own to analyze, reflect on, and develop. The intent is to prompt student reflection with an incorrect, incomplete, or ambiguous written argument or explanation, and for students to improve upon the written work by correcting errors and clarifying meaning. This routine fortifies output and engages students in meta-awareness. Teachers can demonstrate with meta-think-alouds and press for details when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;MLR4: Information Gap Cards&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What: Students conduct a dialog in a specific way. In an Info Gap, one partner gets a problem card with a math question that doesn't have enough given information, and the other partner gets a data card with information relevant to the problem card. Students ask each other questions like "What information do you need?" and are expected to explain what they will do with the information. The first few times students engage in these activities, the teacher should demonstrate, with a partner, how the discussion is expected to go. Once students are familiar with these structures, less set-up will be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why: This activity structure is designed to strengthen the opportunities and supports for high-quality mathematical conversations. Mathematical language is learned by using mathematical language for real and engaging purposes. These activities were designed such that students &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to communicate in order to bridge information gaps. During effective discussions, students should be supported to do the following: pose and answer questions, clarify what is asked and happening in a problem, build common understandings, and share experiences relevant to the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Diagram. information gap procedure. Problem Card Student. Data card student." class="h-max-height--16-lines" height="863" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/im-ims-export/Tz9cxDemwfQMYcWsKGwdpBfU" width="1074" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;MLR5: Co-Craft Questions&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To allow students to get inside of a context before feeling pressure to produce answers, and to create space for students to produce the language of mathematical questions themselves. Through this routine, students are able to use conversation skills as well as develop meta-awareness of the language used in mathematical questions and problems. Teachers should push for clarity and revoice oral responses as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;MLR6: Three Reads&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;To ensure that students know what they are being asked to do, and to create an opportunity for students to reflect on the ways mathematical questions are presented. This routine supports reading comprehension of problems and meta-awareness of mathematical language. It also supports negotiating information in a text with a partner in mathematical conversation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;MLR7: Compare and Connect&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;To foster students' meta-awareness as they identify, compare, and contrast different mathematical approaches, representations, and language. Teachers should demonstrate thinking out loud (e.g., exploring why we one might do or say it this way, questioning an idea, wondering how an idea compares or connects to other ideas or language), and students should be prompted to reflect and respond. This routine supports meta-cognitive and meta-linguistic awareness, and also supports mathematical conversation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;MLR8: Discussion Supports&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;To support rich discussions about mathematical ideas, representations, contexts, and strategies. The examples provided can be combined and used together with any of the other routines. They include multi-modal strategies for helping students comprehend complex language and ideas, and can be used to make classroom communication accessible, to foster meta-awareness of language, and to demonstrate strategies students can use to enhance their own communication and construction of ideas.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Notice and Wonder&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What: This routine can appear as a warm-up or in the launch or synthesis of a classroom activity. Students are shown some media or a mathematical representation. The prompt to students is "What do you notice? What do you wonder?" Students are given a few minutes to think of things they notice and things they wonder, and share them with a partner. Then, the teacher asks several students to share things they noticed and things they wondered; these are recorded by the teacher for all to see. Sometimes, the teacher steers the conversation to wondering about something mathematical that the class is about to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where: Appears frequently in warm-ups but also appears in launches to classroom activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why: The purpose is to make a mathematical task accessible to all students with these two approachable questions. By thinking about them and responding, students gain entry into the context and might get their curiosity piqued. Taking steps to become familiar with a context and the mathematics that might be involved is making sense of problems (MP1). Note: &lt;em&gt;Notice and Wonder&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;I Notice/I Wonder&lt;/em&gt; are trademarks of NCTM and the Math Forum and used in these materials with permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Poll the Class&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What: This routine is used to register an initial response or an estimate, most often in activity launches or to kick off a discussion. It can also be used when data needs to be collected from each student in class, for example, "What is the length of your ear in centimeters?" Every student in class reports a response to the prompt. Teachers need to develop a mechanism by which poll results are collected and displayed so that this frequent form of classroom interaction is seamless. Smaller classes might be able to conduct a roll call by voice. For larger classes, students might be given mini-whiteboards or a set of colored index cards to hold up. Free and paid commercial tools are also readily available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why: Collecting data from the class to use in an activity makes the outcome of the activity more interesting. In other cases, going on record with an estimate makes people want to know if they were right and increases investment in the outcome. If coming up with an estimate is too daunting, ask students for a guess that they are sure is too low or too high. Putting some boundaries on possible outcomes of a problem is an important skill for mathematical modeling (MP4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Take Turns&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What: Students work with a partner or small group. They take turns in the work of the activity, whether it be spotting matches, explaining, justifying, agreeing or disagreeing, or asking clarifying questions. If they disagree, they are expected to support their case and listen to their partner's arguments. The first few times students engage in these activities, the teacher should demonstrate, with a partner, how the discussion is expected to go. Once students are familiar with these structures, less set-up will be necessary. While students are working, the teacher can ask students to restate their question more clearly or paraphrase what their partner said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why: Building in an expectation, through the routine, that students explain the rationale for their choices and listen to another's rationale deepens the understanding that can be achieved through these activities. Specifying that students take turns deciding, explaining, and listening limits the phenomenon where one student takes over and the other does not participate. Taking turns can also give students more opportunities to construct logical arguments and critique others' reasoning (MP3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Think Pair Share&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What: Students have quiet time to think about a problem and work on it individually, and then time to share their response or their progress with a partner. Once these partner conversations have taken place, some students are selected to share their thoughts with the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why: This is a teaching routine useful in many contexts whose purpose is to give all students enough time to think about a prompt and form a response before they are expected to try to verbalize their thinking. First they have an opportunity to share their thinking in a low-stakes way with one partner, so that when they share with the class they can feel calm and confident, as well as say something meaningful that might advance everyone's understanding. Additionally, the teacher has an opportunity to eavesdrop on the partner conversations so that they can purposefully select students to share with the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Which One Doesn't Belong?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What: Students are presented with four figures, diagrams, graphs, or expressions with the prompt "Which one doesn't belong?" Typically, each of the four options "doesn't belong" for a different reason, and the similarities and differences are mathematically significant. Students are prompted to explain their rationale for deciding that one option doesn't belong and given opportunities to make their rationale more precise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where: Warm-ups&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why: Which One Doesn't Belong fosters a need to define terms carefully and use words precisely (MP6) in order to compare and contrast a group of geometric figures or other mathematical representations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mathematical Modeling Prompts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematics is a tool for understanding the world better and making decisions. School mathematics instruction often neglects giving students opportunities to understand this, and reduces mathematics to disconnected rules for moving symbols around on paper. Mathematical modeling is the process of choosing and using appropriate mathematics and statistics to analyze empirical situations, to understand them better, and to improve decisions (NGA 2010). This mathematics will remain important beyond high school in students' lives and education after high school (NCEE 2013).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mathematical modeling prompts and this guidance for how to use them represent our effort to make authentic modeling accessible to all teachers and students using this curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Organizing Principles about Mathematical Modeling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The purpose of mathematical modeling in school mathematics courses is for students to understand that they can use math to better understand things they are interested in in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Mathematical modeling is different from solving word problems. It often feels like initially you are not given enough information to answer the question. There should be room to interpret the problem. There ought to be a range of acceptable assumptions and answers. Modeling requires genuine choices to be made by the modeler.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;It is expected that students have support from their teacher and classmates while modeling with mathematics. It is not a solitary activity. Assessment should focus on feedback that helps students improve their modeling skills.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things the Modeler Does When Modeling with Mathematics (NGA 2010)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pose a problem&lt;/em&gt; that can be explored with quantitative methods. Identify variables in the situation and select those that represent essential features.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Formulate a model&lt;/em&gt;: create and select geometric, graphical, tabular, algebraic, or statistical representations that describe relationships between variables&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compute&lt;/em&gt;: Analyze these relationships and perform computations to draw conclusions&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpret&lt;/em&gt; the conclusions in terms of the original situation&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Validate&lt;/em&gt; the conclusions by comparing them with the situation. Iterate if necessary to improve the model&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Report&lt;/em&gt; the conclusions and the reasoning behind them&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to recognize that in practice, these actions don't often happen in a nice, neat order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;When to Use Mathematical Modeling Prompts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A component of this is mathematical modeling prompts. Prompts include multiple versions of a task (the multiple versions require students engage in more or fewer aspects of mathematical modeling), sample solutions, instructions to teachers for launching the prompt in class and supporting students with that particular prompt, and an an analysis of each version showing how much of a "lift" the prompt is along several dimensions of mathematical modeling. A mathematical modeling prompt could be done as a classroom lesson or given as a project. This is a choice made by the teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mathematical modeling prompt done as a classroom lesson could take one day of instruction or more than one day, depending on how much of the modeling cycle students are expected to engage in, how extensively they are expected to revise their model, and how elaborate the reporting requirements are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mathematical modeling prompt done as a project could span several days or weeks. The project is assigned and students work on it in the background while daily math lessons continue to be conducted. (Much like research papers or creative writing assignments in other content areas.) This structure has the advantage of giving students extended time for more complex modeling prompts that would not be feasible to complete in one class period and affords more time for iterations on the model and cycles of feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modeling prompts don't necessarily need to involve the same math as the current unit of study. As such, the prompts can be given at any time as long as students have the background to construct a reasonable model. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students might flex their modeling muscles using mathematical concepts that are below grade level. First of all, learning to model mathematically is demanding-learning to do it while also learning new math concepts is likely to be out of reach. Second of all, we know that in future life and work, when students will be called on to engage in mathematical modeling, they will often need to apply math concepts from early grades to ambiguous situations (Forman &amp; Steen, 1995). This elusive category of problems which are high school level yet draw on mathematics first learned in earlier grades may seem contradictory in a curriculum that takes focus and alignment seriously. However, p. 84 of the standards alludes to such problems, and Table 1 in the &lt;a href="http://www.corestandards.org/wp-content/uploads/Math_Publishers_Criteria_HS_Spring_2013_FINAL1.pdf"&gt;high school publisher's criteria&lt;/a&gt; (p. 8) leaves room for including such problems in high school materials in column 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mathematical modeling prompts are not the only opportunities for students to engage in aspects of mathematical modeling in the curriculum. Mathematical modeling is often new territory for both students and teachers.  Oftentimes within the regular classroom lessons, activities include scaled-back modeling scenarios, for which students only need to engage in a part of the modeling cycle. These activities are tagged with the "Aspects of Modeling" instructional routine, and the specific opportunity to engage in an aspect of modeling is explained in the activity narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How to Prepare and Conduct the Modeling Lesson or Project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Decide which version of the prompt to give.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Have data ready to share if you plan to give it when students ask.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Ensure students have access to tools they might be expected to use.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;If desired, instruct students to use a template for organizing modeling work.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Whether doing the prompt as a classroom lesson or giving as a project, plan to do the in-class launch in class.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Decide to what extent students are expected to iterate and refine their model. If you are conducting a one-day lesson, students may not have much time to refine their model and may not engage as much in that part of the modeling cycle. If you conduct a lesson that takes more than one day, or give the task as a project, it is more reasonable to expect students to iterate and refine their model once or even several times.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Decide how students will report their results. If conducting a one-day lesson, this may be a rough visual display on a whiteboard. If more time is allotted or the task is assigned as a project, you might instruct students to write a more formal report, slideshow, blog post, poster, or create an a mockup of an artifact like a letter to a specific audience, a smartphone app, a menu, or a set of policies for a government entity to consider. One way to scaffold this work is to ask students to turn in a certain number of presentation slides: one that states the assumptions made, one that describes the model, and one or more slides with their conclusions or recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Decide how students will be assessed. Prepare a rubric that will be used and share it with them. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ideas for Setting Up an Environment Conducive to Modeling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Provide plenty of blank whiteboard or chalkboard space for groups to work together comfortably. "Vertical non-permanent surfaces" are most conducive to productive collaborative work. "Vertical" means on a vertical wall is better than horizontally on a tabletop, and "non-permanent" means something like a dry erase board is better than something like chart paper (Liljedahl 2016).&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Ensure that students have easy access to any tools that might be useful for the task. These might include:&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;A supply table containing geometry tools, calculators, scratch paper, graph paper, dry erase markers, post-its&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Electronic devices to access digital tools (like graphing technology, dynamic geometry software, or statistical technology)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Think about how you will help students manage the time that is available to work on the task. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;For lessons, display a countdown timer for intermittent points in the class when you will ask each group to summarize their progress&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;For lessons, decide what time you will ask groups to transition to writing down their findings in a somewhat organized way (perhaps 15 minutes before the end of the class)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;For projects, set some intermediate milestone deadlines to help students know if they are on track.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Organizing Students into Teams or Groups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Mathematical modeling is not a solitary activity. It works best when students have support from each other and their teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Working with a team can make it possible to complete the work in a finite amount of class time. For example, the team may decide it wants to vary one element of the prompt, and compute the output for each variation. What would be many tedious calculations for one person could be only a few calculations for each team member.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The members of good modeling groups bring a diverse set of skills and points of view. Scramble the members of modeling teams often, so that students have opportunities to play different roles.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ways to Support Students While They Work on a Modeling Prompt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Coach them on ways to organize their work better.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Provide a template to help them organize their thinking. Over time, some groups may transition away from needing to use a template.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Remind them of analog and digital tools that are available to them.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;When students get stuck or neglect an important aspect of the work, ask them a question to help them engage more fully in part of the modeling cycle. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;What quantities are important? Which ones change and which ones stay the same? (identify variables)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;What information do you know? What information would it be nice to know? How could you get that information? What reasonable assumption could you make? (identify variables)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;What pictures, diagrams, graphs, or equations might help people understand the relationships between the quantities? (formulate)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;How are you describing the situation mathematically? Where does your solution come from? (compute)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Under what conditions does your model work? When might it not work? (interpret)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;How could you make your model better? How could you make your model more useful under more conditions? (validate)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;What parts of your solution might be confusing to someone reading it? How could you make it more clear? (report)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to Interpret the Provided Analysis of a Modeling Prompt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any mathematical modeling prompt, different versions are provided. We chose to analyze each version along 5 impactful dimensions that vary the demands on the modeler (OECD 2013). Each version of a mathematical modeling prompt is accompanied by an analysis chart that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th scope="row"&gt;attribute&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;DQ&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;QI&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;SD&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;AD&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;M&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;mean&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th scope="row"&gt;lift&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;0.6&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of the attributes of a modeling problem is scored on a scale from 0-2. A lower score indicates a prompt with a "lighter lift" for students and teachers: students are engaging in less open, less authentic mathematical modeling. A higher score indicates a prompt with a "heavier lift" for students and teachers: students are engaging in more open, more authentic mathematical modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This matrix shows the attributes that are part of our analysis of each mathematical modeling prompt. We recognize that not all the attributes have the same impact on what teachers and students do. However, for the sake of simplicity they are all weighted the same when they are averaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th scope="row"&gt;index&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;th scope="col"&gt;attribute&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;th scope="col"&gt;light lift (0)&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;th scope="col"&gt;medium lift (1)&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;th scope="col"&gt;heavy lift (2)&lt;/th&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th scope="row"&gt;DQ&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Defining the Question&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;well-posed question&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;elements of ambiguity; prompt might suggest ways assumptions could be made&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;freedom to specify and simplify the prompt; modeler must state assumptions&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th scope="row"&gt;QI&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Quantities of Interest&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;key variables are declared&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;key variables are suggested&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;key variables are not evident&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th scope="row"&gt;SD&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Source of Data&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;data is provided&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;modelers are told what measurements to take or data to look up&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;modelers must decide what measurements to take or data to look up&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th scope="row"&gt;AD&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Amount of Data given&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;modeler is given all the information they need and no more&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;some extra information is given and modeler must decide what is important; or, not enough information is given and modeler must ask for it before teacher provides it&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;modeler must sift through lots of given information and decide what is important; or, not enough information is given and modeler must make assumptions, look it up, or take measurements&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th scope="row"&gt;M&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;The Model&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;a model is given in the form of a mathematical representation&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;type of model is suggested in words or by a familiar context; or, modeler chooses appropriate model from a provided list&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;careful thought about quantities and relationships or additional work (like constructing a scatterplot or drawing geometric examples) is required to identify type of model to use&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recognize that there are other features of a mathematical modeling prompt that could be varied. In the interests of not making things too complex, we only included 5 dimensions in the lift analysis. However, one might choose to modify a prompt on one of these dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;whether the scenario is posed with words, a highly-structured image or video, or real-world artifacts like articles or authentic diagrams&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;presenting example for student to explore before they are expected to engage with the prompt, versus the prompt suggesting that the modeler generate examples or expecting the modeler to generate examples on their own&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;whether the prompt makes decisions about units of measure or expects the modeler to reconcile units of measure or employ dimensional thinking&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;whether a pre-made digital or analog tool is provided, instructions given for using a particular tool, use of a particular tool is suggested, or modelers simply have access to familiar tools but are not prompted to use them&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;whether a mathematical representation is given, suggested, or modelers have the freedom to select and create representations of their own choosing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;References&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Supporting English-Language Learners&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These materials include embedded instructional routines and practices aimed to support instruction that meets the needs of linguistically and culturally diverse students who are learning mathematics while simultaneously acquiring English. Access supports for English learners are designed to provide students with access to the academic language demands for all students learning mathematics, specifically the demands of reading, writing, listening, speaking, conversing, and representing (Aguirre &amp; Bunch, 2012).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design Principles For Promoting Mathematical Language Use And Development &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framework for supporting English learners (ELs), developed by the team at Understanding Language/Stanford Center for Assessment, Learning, and Equity (UL/SCALE) at Stanford University, includes four design principles for promoting mathematical language use and development in curriculum and instruction. The design principles and related routines work to make language development an integral part of planning and delivering instruction while guiding teachers to amplify the most important language that students are expected to bring to bear on the central mathematical ideas of each unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle 1: SUPPORT SENSE-MAKING &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scaffold tasks and amplify language so students can make their own meaning.&lt;/strong&gt; Students need multiple opportunities to talk about their mathematical thinking, negotiate meaning with others, and collaboratively solve problems with targeted guidance from the teacher. Teachers can make language more accessible for students by amplifying rather than simplifying speech or text. Simplifying includes avoiding the use of challenging words or phrases. Amplifying means anticipating where students might need language support to understand concepts or mathematical terms, and providing multiple ways to access them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle 2: OPTIMIZE OUTPUT &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen opportunities and structures for students to describe their mathematical thinking to others, orally, visually, and in writing.&lt;/strong&gt; Linguistic output is the language that students use to communicate their ideas to others. All students benefit from repeated, strategically optimized, and structured opportunities to articulate mathematical ideas into linguistic expression. Opportunities for students to produce output should be strategically optimized for both (a) important concepts of the unit or course, and (b) important disciplinary language functions (making generalizations, making conjectures and claims, justifying claims with evidence, explaining reasoning, critiquing the reasoning of others, and comparing approaches and representations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle 3: CULTIVATE CONVERSATION &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen opportunities and structures for constructive mathematical conversations (pairs, groups, and whole-class).&lt;/strong&gt; Conversations act as scaffolds for students developing mathematical language because they provide opportunities to simultaneously make meaning, communicate that meaning, and refine the way content understandings are communicated. When students have a purpose for talking and listening to each other, communication is more authentic. During effective discussions, students pose and answer questions, clarify what is being asked and what is happening in a problem, build common understandings, and share experiences relevant to the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle 4: MAXIMIZE META-AWARENESS &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen the meta-connections and distinctions between mathematical ideas, reasoning, and language.&lt;/strong&gt; Language is a tool that not only allows students to communicate their math understanding to others, but also to organize their own experiences, ideas, and learning for themselves. Meta-awareness is consciously thinking about one's own thought processes or language use. Meta-awareness develops when students and teachers engage in classroom activities or discussions that bring explicit attention to what students need to do to improve communication and reasoning about mathematical concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mathematical Language Routines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each lesson includes instructional strategies that teachers can use to facilitate access to the language demands of a lesson or activity. These support strategies, labeled "Access for English Learners," suggest mathematical language routines (MLRs) that provide students with access by supporting them with the language demands of a specific activity, without reducing the mathematical demand of the task. A mathematical language routine is a structured but adaptable format for amplifying, assessing, and developing students' language. The mathematical language routines were selected because they are effective and practical for simultaneously learning mathematical practices, content, and language. Using these routines will help maintain student engagement in mathematical discourse and ensure that the struggle remains productive. For a description of each MLR, see the Instructional Routines section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Supporting Students with Disabilities&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All students are individuals who can know, use, and enjoy mathematics. These materials empower students with activities that capitalize on their existing strengths and abilities to ensure that all learners can participate meaningfully in rigorous mathematical content. Lessons support a flexible approach to instruction and provide teachers with options for additional support to address the needs of a diverse group of students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Curriculum features that support access&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each lesson is carefully designed to maximize engagement and accessibility for all students. Purposeful design elements that support access for all learners, but that are especially helpful for students with disabilities, include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson Structures are Consistent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of every lesson is the same: warm-up, activities, synthesis, cool-down. By keeping the components of each lesson similar from day to day, the flow of work in class becomes predictable for students. This reduces cognitive demand and enables students to focus on the mathematics at hand rather than the mechanics of the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concepts Develop from Concrete to Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mathematical concepts are introduced simply, concretely, and repeatedly, with complexity and abstraction developing over time. Students begin with concrete examples, and transition to diagrams and tables before relying exclusively on symbols to represent the mathematics they encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual to Pair, or Small Group to Whole Class Progression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing students with time to think through a situation or question independently before engaging with others allows students to carry the weight of learning, with support arriving just in time from the community of learners. This progression allows students to first activate what they already know, and continue to build from this base with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunities to Apply Mathematics to Real-World Contexts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving students opportunities to apply the mathematics they learn clarifies and deepens their understanding of core math concepts and skills and provides motivation and support. Mathematical modeling is a powerful activity for all students, but especially students with disabilities. Each unit has a culminating activity designed to explore, integrate, and apply all the big ideas of the unit. Centering instruction on these contextual situations can provide students with disabilities an anchor on which to base their mathematical understandings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Instructional strategies that support access&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following general instructional strategies can be used to enhance access for all students to rigorous, grade-level content: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminate Barriers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eliminate any unnecessary barriers that students may encounter that prevent them from engaging with the important mathematical work of a lesson. This requires flexibility and attention to areas such as the physical environment of the classroom, access to tools, organization of lesson activities, and means of communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processing Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increased time engaged in thinking and learning leads to mastery of grade-level content for all students, including students with disabilities. Frequent switching between topics creates confusion and does not allow for content to deeply embed in the mind of the learner. Mathematical ideas and representations are carefully introduced in the materials in a gradual, purposeful way to establish a base of conceptual understanding. Some students may need additional time, which should be provided as required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assistive Technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assistive technology can be a vital tool for students with learning disabilities, visual spatial needs, sensory integration, and students with autism. Assistive technology supports suggested in the materials are designed to either enhance or support learning, or to bypass unnecessary barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manipulatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physical manipulatives help students make connections between concrete ideas and abstract representations. Often, students with disabilities benefit from hands-on activities, which allow them to make sense of the problem at hand and communicate their own mathematical ideas and solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual Aids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visual aids such as images, diagrams, vocabulary anchor charts, color coding, or physical demonstrations are suggested throughout the materials to support conceptual processing and language development. Keeping relevant visual aids posted in the classroom supports independence by allowing students to access them as needed, and is especially beneficial for students with challenges related to working or short term memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graphic Organizers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word webs, Venn diagrams, tables, and other metacognitive visual supports provide structures that illustrate relationships between mathematical facts, concepts, words, or ideas. Graphic organizers can be used to support students with organizing thoughts and ideas, planning problem solving approaches, visualizing ideas, sequencing information, and comparing and contrasting ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Breaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brain breaks are short, structured, 2-3 minute movement breaks taken between activities, or to break up a longer activity (approximately every 20-30 minutes during a class period). Brain breaks are a quick, effective way of refocusing and re-energizing the physical and mental state of students during a lesson. Brain breaks have also been shown to positively impact student concentration and stress levels, resulting in more time spent engaged in mathematical problem solving. This universal support is beneficial for all students, especially those with attention challenges or disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Access for Students with Disabilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supplemental instructional strategies, labeled "Access for Students with Disabilities," are included in each lesson. They are designed to help teachers meet the individual needs of a diverse group of learners. Each  is aligned to one of the three principles of Universal Design for Learning, to provide multiple means of engagement, representation, or action and expression, and includes a suggested strategy to increase access and eliminate barriers. These lesson specific supports can be used as needed to help students succeed with a specific activity, without reducing the mathematical demand of the task, and can be faded out as students gain understanding and fluency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following areas of cognitive functioning are integral to learning mathematics (Addressing Accessibility project, Brodesky et al., 2002), and are indicated in each access support, so that teachers can leverage students' strengths to address potential barriers or challenges that exist in the learning environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conceptual Processing&lt;/em&gt; includes perceptual reasoning, problem solving, and metacognition.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Language&lt;/em&gt; includes auditory and visual language processing and expression.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visual-Spatial Processing&lt;/em&gt; includes processing visual information and understanding relation in space of visual mathematical representations and geometric concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Organization&lt;/em&gt; includes organizational skills, attention, and focus.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Memory&lt;/em&gt; includes working memory and short-term memory.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attention&lt;/em&gt; includes paying attention to details, maintaining focus, and filtering out extraneous information.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social-Emotional Functioning&lt;/em&gt; includes interpersonal skills and the cognitive comfort and safety required in order to take risks and make mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fine Motor Skills&lt;/em&gt; includes tasks that require small muscle movement and coordination such as manipulating objects (graphing, cutting with scissors, writing).&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The additional supports for students with disabilities were designed using the Universal Design for Learning Guidelines (http://udlguidelines.cast.org). Each support aligns to one of the three principles of UDL: engagement, representation, and action and expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engagement:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students' attitudes, interests, and values help to determine the ways in which they are most engaged and motivated to learn. Supports that align to this principle offer instructional strategies that provide students with multiple means of engagement and include suggestions that, help provide access by leveraging curiosity and students' existing interests, leverage choice around perceived challenge, encourage and support opportunities for peer collaboration; provide structures that help students maintain sustained effort and persistence during a task, and provide tools and strategies designed to help students self-motivate and become more independent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Representation: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers can reduce barriers and leverage students' individual strengths by inviting students to engage with the same content in different ways. Supports that align to this principle offer instructional strategies that provide students with multiple means of representation and include suggestions that offer alternatives for the ways information is presented or displayed, help develop students' understanding and use of mathematical language and symbols; illustrate connections between and across mathematical representations using color and annotations, identify opportunities to activate or supply background knowledge, and describe organizational methods and approaches designed to help students internalize learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action and Expression:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the curriculum, students are invited to share both their understanding and their reasoning about mathematical ideas with others. Supports that align to this principle offer instructional strategies that provide students with multiple means of action and expression and include suggestions that encourage flexibility and choice with the ways students demonstrate their understanding; list sentence frames that support discourse or accompany writing prompts; indicate appropriate tools, templates, and assistive technologies; support the development of organizational skills in problem-solving; and provide checklists that enable students to monitor their own progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Accessibility for Students with Visual Impairments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Features built into the materials that make them more accessible to students with visual impairments include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A color palette using colors that are distinguishable to people with the most common types of color blindness.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Tasks and problems designed such that success does not depend on the ability to distinguish between colors.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Mathematical diagrams are presented in scalable vector graphic (SVG) format, which can be magnified without loss of resolution, and are possible to render in Braille.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Where possible, text associated with images is not part of the image file, but rather, included as an image caption that is accessible to screen readers.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Alt text on all images, to make the materials easier to interpret for users accessing the materials with a screen reader.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;If students with visual impairments are accessing the materials using a screen reader, it is important to understand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;All images in the curriculum have alt text: a very short indication of the image's contents, so that the screen reader doesn't skip over as if nothing is there.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Some images have a longer description to help a student with a visual impairment recreate the image in their mind.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important for teachers to understand that students with visual impairments are likely to need help accessing images in lesson activities and assessments, and prepare appropriate accommodations. Be aware that mathematical diagrams are provided as scalable vector graphics (SVG format), because this format can be magnified without loss of resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accessibility experts who reviewed this curriculum recommended that students who would benefit should have access to a Braille version of the curriculum materials, because a verbal description of many of the complex mathematical diagrams would be inadequate for supporting their learning. All diagrams are provided in the SVG file type so that they can be rendered in Braille format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Learning Goals and Targets&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Learning Goals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teacher-facing learning goals appear at the top of lesson plans. They describe, for a teacher audience, the mathematical, pedagogical, and language goals of the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student-facing learning goals appear in student materials at the beginning of each lesson and start with the word "Let's." They are intended to invite students into the work of that day without giving away too much and spoiling the problem-based instruction. They are suitable for writing on the board before class begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Learning Targets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These appear in student materials at the end of each unit. They describe, for a student audience, the mathematical goals of each lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not recommend writing learning targets on the board before class begins, because doing so might spoil the problem-based instruction. (The student-facing learning goals (that start with "Let's") are more appropriate for this purpose.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers and students might use learning targets in a number of ways. Some examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;targets for standards-based grading&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;prompts for a written reflection as part of a lesson synthesis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;a study aid for self-assessment, review, or catching up after an absence from school&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to Assess Progress&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The materials contain many opportunities and tools for both formative and summative assessment. Some things are purely formative, but the tools that can be used for summative assessment can also be used formatively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each unit begins with a diagnostic assessment ("&lt;em&gt;Check Your Readiness&lt;/em&gt;") of concepts and skills that are prerequisite to the unit as well as a few items that assess what students already know of the key contexts and concepts that will be addressed by the unit.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Each instructional task is accompanied by commentary about expected student responses and potential misconceptions so that teachers can adjust their instruction depending on what students are doing in response to the task. Often there are suggested questions to help teachers better understand students' thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Each lesson includes a cool-down (analogous to an exit slip or exit ticket) to assess whether students understood the work of that day's lesson. Teachers may use this as a formative assessment to provide feedback or to plan further instruction.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A set of practice problems is provided for each lesson that can be assigned for homework or in-class practice. The teacher can choose to collect and grade these or simply provide feedback to students.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Each unit includes an end-of-unit written assessment that is intended for students to complete individually to assess what they have learned at the conclusion of the unit. Longer units also include a mid-unit assessment. The mid-unit assessment states which lesson, in the middle of the unit, it is designed to follow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Diagnostic Assessments&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of each unit is a pre-unit diagnostic assessment that is titled &lt;em&gt;Check Your Readiness&lt;/em&gt;. These assessments vary in length. Most of the problems address prerequisite concepts and skills for the unit. Teachers can use these problems to identify students with particular below-grade needs, or topics to carefully address during the unit. &lt;em&gt;Check Your Readiness&lt;/em&gt; also may include problems that assess what students already know of the upcoming unit's key ideas, which teachers can use to pace or tune instruction; in rare cases, this may signal the opportunity to move more quickly through a topic to optimize instructional time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if a large number of students can't do the same pre-unit assessment problem?&lt;/em&gt; Teachers are encouraged to address below-grade skills while continuing to work through the on-grade tasks and concepts of each unit, instead of abandoning the current work in favor of material that only addresses below-grade skills. Look for opportunities within the upcoming unit where the target skill could be addressed in context. For example, an upcoming activity might require solving an equation in one variable. Some strategies might include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ask a student who can do the skill to present their method&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;add additional questions to the warm-up with the purpose of revisiting the skill&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;add to the activity launch a few related equations to solve, before students need to solve an equation while working on the activity&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;pause the class while working on the activity to focus on the portion that requires solving an equation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, attend carefully to students as they work through the activity. If difficulty persists, add more opportunities to practice the skill, by adapting tasks or practice problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if all students do really well on Check Your Readiness?&lt;/em&gt; That means they are ready for the work ahead, and special attention doesn't likely need to be paid to below-grade skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cool-Downs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each lesson includes a cool-down (also known as an exit slip or exit ticket) to be given to students at the end of the lesson. This activity serves as a brief checkpoint to determine whether students understood the main concepts of that lesson. Teachers can use this as a formative assessment to plan further instruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if the feedback from a cool-down suggests students haven't understood a key concept? Choose one or more of these strategies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look at the next few lessons to see if students have more opportunities to engage with the same topic. If so, plan to focus on the topic in the context of the new activities. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;During the next lesson, display the work of a few students on that cool-down. Anonymize their names, but show some correct and incorrect work. Ask the class to observe some things each student did well and could have done better. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Give each student brief, written feedback on their cool-down that asks a question that nudges them to re-examine their work. Ask students to revise and resubmit.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Look for practice problems that are similar to, or involve the same topic as the cool-down, then assign those problems over the next few lessons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is an example. For a lesson in Algebra 1, unit 2, the learning goals are &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create and interpret graphs of inequalities in two variables.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Write inequalities in two variables to represent situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cool-down reads: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A band is playing at an auditorium with floor seats and balcony seats. The band wants to sell the floor tickets for &lt;span&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;15 each and the balcony tickets for &lt;span&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;12 each. They want to make at least &lt;span&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;3,000 in ticket sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How much money will they collect for selling &lt;span class="math math-repaired"&gt;\( x \)&lt;/span&gt; floor tickets?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How much money will they collect for selling &lt;span class="math math-repaired"&gt;\( y \)&lt;/span&gt; balcony tickets?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Write an inequality whose solutions are the number of floor and balcony tickets sold if they make at least &lt;span&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;3,000 in ticket sales.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use technology to graph the solutions to your inequality, and sketch the graph.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of students were able to write &lt;span class="math math-repaired"&gt;\( 15x \)&lt;/span&gt; to represent the money collected selling floor tickets and &lt;span class="math math-repaired"&gt;\( 12y \)&lt;/span&gt; to represent the money collected selling balcony tickets. However, they wrote the inequality &lt;span class="math math-repaired"&gt;\( 15x+12y &lt; 3,\!000 \)&lt;/span&gt; and sketched a graph corresponding to this incorrect inequality. You suspect that students interpreted "at least" to mean the same thing as "less than." Here are some possible strategies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the next four lessons, there are more opportunities to interpret the meaning of "at least." When launching these activities, pause to assist students to interpret this correctly. For example, an activity reads, "He needs at least 9.5 yards of fabric altogether." Ask students, "If he needs &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; 9.5 yards, what kinds of numbers are we looking for?" [9.5 yards or anything more than 9.5 yards]. "Since he needs more than 9.5 yards, the amount of fabric needs to be less than 9.5 yards? or greater than 9.5 yards?" [greater than]&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Select the work of one student who answered correctly and one student whose work had the common error. In the next class, display these together for all to see (hide the students' names). Ask each student to decide which interpretation is correct, and defend their choice to their partner. Select students to share their reasoning with the class who have different ways of knowing that "at least &lt;span&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;3,000" means "more than &lt;span&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;3,000."&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Write feedback for each student along the lines of "What are some different dollar amounts that would satisfy their wish to make at least &lt;span&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;3,000?" Allow students to revise and resubmit their work.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Look for practice problems in upcoming lessons that require students to correctly interpret the term "at least," and be sure to assign those problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;End of Unit Assessments&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of each unit is the &lt;em&gt;end-of-unit assessment&lt;/em&gt;. These assessments have a specific length and breadth, with problem types that are intended to gauge students' understanding of the key concepts of the unit while also preparing students for new-generation standardized exams. Problem types include multiple-choice, multiple response, short answer, restricted constructed response, and extended response. Problems vary in difficulty and depth of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers may choose to grade these assessments in a standardized fashion, but may also choose to grade more formatively by asking students to show and explain their work on all problems. Teachers may also decide to make changes to the provided assessments to better suit their needs. If making changes, teachers are encouraged to keep the format of problem types provided, which helps students know what to expect and ensures each assessment will take approximately the same amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In longer units, a &lt;em&gt;mid-unit assessment&lt;/em&gt; is also available. This assessment has the same form and structure as an end-of-unit assessment. In longer units, the end-of-unit assessment will include the breadth of all content for the full unit, with emphasis on the content from the second half of the unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All summative assessment problems include a complete solution and standard alignment. Multiple-choice and multiple response problems often include a reason for each potential error a student might make. Restricted constructed response and extended response items include a rubric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike formative assessments, problems on summative assessments generally do not prescribe a method of solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A note about technology use on assessments&lt;/em&gt;: Some assessments require use of technology, some allow it, and some prohibit it. These affordances or restrictions are communicated in each assessment narrative and in instructions to students. Reasons we chose to prohibit use of technology on some assessments include assessing a standard that requires students to sketch a graph by hand, and assessing a standard that requires students to use mathematical properties to rewrite expressions. Conversely, some standards specify that students must use technology for certain things, like generating a best-fit line and correlation coefficient. On assessments where these skills are assessed, technology is required. This approach is in keeping with many state and national standardized assessments that include calculator-allowed and calculator-prohibited portions. Our approach, though, is to allow or prohibit technology on an &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; assessment-no single assessment in this curriculum contains both technology-allowed and technology-prohibited portions.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Design Principles for Summative Assessments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students should get the correct answer on assessment problems for the right reasons, and get incorrect answers for the right reasons. To help with this, our assessment problems are targeted and short, use consistent, positive wording, and have clear, undebatable correct responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In multiple-choice problems, distractors are common errors and misconceptions directly relating to what is being assessed, since problems are intended to test whether the student has proficiency on a specific skill. The distractors serve as a diagnostic, giving teachers the chance to quickly see which of the most common errors are being made. There are no trick questions, and the phrases "all of the above" and "none of the above" are never used, since they do not give useful information about the methods a student used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple response prompts always include the phrase "select&lt;strong&gt; all&lt;/strong&gt;" to clearly indicate their type. Each part of a multiple response problem addresses a different piece of the same overall skill, again serving as a diagnostic for teachers to understand which common errors students are making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short answer, restricted constructed response, and extended response problems are careful to avoid compounding errors, where a part of the problem asks for students to use correct work from a previous part. This choice is made to ensure that students have all possible opportunities to show proficiency on assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When possible, extended response problems provide multiple ways for students to demonstrate understanding of the content being assessed, through some combination of arithmetic or algebra, use of representations (tables, graphs, diagrams, expressions, and equations) and explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Rubrics for Evaluating Student Answers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restricted constructed response and extended response items have rubrics that can be used to evaluate the level of student responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restricted Constructed Response&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tier 1 response&lt;/em&gt;: Work is complete and correct.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tier 2 response&lt;/em&gt;: Work shows general conceptual understanding and mastery, with some errors.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tier 3 response&lt;/em&gt;: Significant errors in work demonstrate lack of conceptual understanding or mastery. Two or more error types from Tier 2 responsecan be given as the reason for a Tier 3 response instead of listing combinations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extended Response&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tier 1 response&lt;/em&gt;: Work is complete and correct, with complete explanation or justification.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tier 2 response&lt;/em&gt;: Work shows good conceptual understanding and mastery, with either minor errors or correct work with insufficient explanation or justification.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tier 3 response&lt;/em&gt;: Work shows a developing but incomplete conceptual understanding, with significant errors.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tier 4 response&lt;/em&gt;: Work includes major errors or omissions that demonstrate a lack of conceptual understanding and mastery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, sample errors are included. Acceptable errors can be listed at any Tier (as an additional bullet point), notably Tier 1, to specify exclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Performance Tasks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Narrative&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students begin the course with one-variable statistics, building on ideas from middle school. Starting with data collection and analysis sets a tone for the course of understanding quantities in context. It also allows students to access grade-level mathematics that isn't as dependent on prior skills as some other topics. Gathering and displaying data, measuring data distribution, and interpreting statistical results encourages students to collaborate, communicate, and explore new tools and routines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, students move on to expand their understanding of linear equations, inequalities, and systems of linear equations and inequalities. They use these representations to model relationships and constraints but also reason with them abstractly. Students write, rearrange, evaluate, and solve equations and inequalities, explaining and validating their reasoning with increased precision. They then take these insights to a unit on two-variable statistics, where they extend their prior knowledge of scatter plots and lines of best fit. Students use residuals and correlation coefficients to assess linear models, interpret quantitative data, and distinguish correlation and causality. They also determine associations in categorical data, by using two-way tables and relative frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, students study functions, continuing the work begun in grade 8. Over the next few units, they deepen their understanding of functions and deepen their ability to represent, interpret, and communicate about them-using function notation, domain and range, average rate of change, and features of graphs. They also see categories of functions, starting with linear functions (including their inverses) and piecewise-defined functions (including absolute value functions), followed by exponential and quadratic functions. For each function type, students begin their investigation with real-world and mathematical contexts, look closely at the structural attributes of the function, and analyze how these attributes are expressed in different representations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course ends with a close look at quadratic equations. Students extend their ability to use equations to model relationships and solve problems. They develop their capacity to write, transform, graph, and solve equations-by reasoning, rearranging equations into useful forms, and applying the quadratic formula. In solving quadratic equations students encounter rational and irrational solutions, providing an opportunity to deepen their understanding of the real number system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the classroom activities, students have opportunities to engage in aspects of mathematical modeling. Additionally, modeling prompts are provided for use throughout the course. Modeling prompts offer opportunities for students to engage in the full modeling cycle. These can be implemented in a variety of ways. Please see the course guide for a more detailed explanation of modeling prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Pacing Guide&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;div class="g--row g--row-1"&gt;
&lt;div class="g--col-1 g--column g--content g--one-twelfth g--row-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="g--col-2 g--column g--content g--five-sixth g--row-1"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="g--col-3 g--column g--content g--one-twelfth g--row-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dependency Chart&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="unit dependency chart" height="1200" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/im-ims-export/VDs3wH9YoAWrSKKuMXwFwXMe" width="1200" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the unit dependency chart, an arrow indicates that a particular unit is designed for students who already know the material in a previous unit. Reversing the order would have a negative effect on mathematical or pedagogical coherence. Some dependencies are needed to address the standards. For example, there is an arrow from G.3 to G.4, because students learn that&lt;em&gt; by similarity&lt;/em&gt;, side ratios in right triangles are properties of the angles in the triangle, leading to definitions of trigonometric ratios for acute angles. Some are a consequence of choices made by the authors. For example, there is an arrow from A1.5 to A1.6, because when quadratic functions are introduced, they are contrasted with exponential functions, assuming that students are already familiar with exponential functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following chart shows unit dependencies across the 6-12 curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
