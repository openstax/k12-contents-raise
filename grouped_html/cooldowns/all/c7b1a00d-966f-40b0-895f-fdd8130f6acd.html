    <p>Now, combine your new understanding of factoring with using the <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">zero product property</span> to solve equations.</p>
    <p>Solve the equation \(2x^2&minus; 7x + 5 = 0\) by any method. Be prepared to explain your reasoning.</p>

    <p>Enter the solution to the equation \(2x^2&minus; 7x + 5 = 0\) and your explanation.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="os-raise-ib-input-ack">
    <p>Compare your answer:</p>
    <p> \(x=\frac {5}{2}\) (or 2.5) and \(x=1\). Rewriting the expression in factored form gives \((2x &minus; 5)(x &minus; 1) = 0\). Using the zero product property: \(2x &minus; 5 = 0\) or \(x &minus; 1 = 0\), so \(x=\frac {5}{2}\) and \(x = 1\).</p>

      <p class="os-raise-mb-0">People typically spend more time learning about things they are curious about and more readily remember the information. Curious people tend to be happier individuals. </p>
      <p>Think about your current sense of curiosity. Are the following statements are true for you?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When I didn’t know the answer to a question, I couldn’t rest until I figured it out.  
        </li>
        <li>
          I explored a completely new idea or topic—just for the fun of it. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Don’t worry if none of these statements are true for you. Developing this trait takes time. Your first step starts today!</p>
