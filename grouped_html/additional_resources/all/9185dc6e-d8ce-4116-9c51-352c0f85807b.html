<h4>Writing Recursive Definitions</h4>
<p>Sometimes we can define a sequence recursively. That is, we can describe how to calculate the next term in a sequence if we know the previous term.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a sequence: 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, . . . This is an arithmetic sequence, where each term is 4 more than the previous term. Since sequences are functions, let&rsquo;s call this sequence \(f\). Then we can use function notation to write \(f(n)=f(n-1)+4\). Here, \(f(n)\) is the term, \(f(n-1)\) is the previous term, and + 4 represents the common difference since \(f\) is an arithmetic sequence.</p>
<p>When we define a function recursively, we must also say what the first term is. Without that, there would be no way of knowing if the sequence defined by \(f(n)=f(n-1)+4\) started with 6 or 81 or any other number. Here, one possible initial condition is \(f(1)=6\). It could also make sense to number the terms starting with 0, using \(f(0)=6\).</p>
<p>Combining this information gives the recursive definition: \(f(1)=6\) and \(f(n)=f(n-1)+4\) for \(n\geq2\), where \(n\) is an integer. We include the \(n\geq2\) at the end since the value of \(f\) at 1 is already given, and the other terms in the sequence are generated by inputting integers larger than 1 into the definition.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some examples from the first activity and write the recursive definition for each type of sequence:</p>

<h5>Example 1</h5>
<br>
<p><strong>Sequence A:</strong> \(30, 40, 50, 60, 70, …\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Determine the type of sequence</p>
<p>This sequence is arithmetic.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Determine the common difference or common ratio</p>
<p>The terms increase by adding a value of 10, so the common difference is 10.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Determine the formula or rule</p>
<p>Since one term’s value comes from adding 10 to the term value before it, that means \( n = (n - 1) + 10 \). Now write this rule using function notation.</p>
<p>\( A(n) = A(n-1) + 10 \)</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Determine the initial condition or basis</p>
<p>\( A(1) = 30 \)</p>

<p><strong>Step 5</strong> - Determine the domain of the formula</p>
<p>We use the first term to find the second term, so that is where we start at \( n = 2 \). So, our domain is \( n \geq 2 \).</p>

<p>The recursive definition for 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, … is \( A(1) = 30 \), \( A(n) = A(n-1) + 10 \), \( n \geq 2 \).</p>

<h5>Example 2</h5>
<br>
<p><strong>Sequence B:</strong> \(80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 2.5, …\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Determine the type of sequence</p>
<p>This sequence is geometric.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Determine the common difference or common ratio</p>
<p>The terms are divided by 2 each time, so the common ratio is \( \frac{1}{2} \) (since it is divided by 2).</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Determine the formula or rule</p>
<p>Since one term’s value comes from multiplying \( \frac{1}{2} \) to the term value before it, that means \( n = (n - 1) \times \frac{1}{2} \). Now write this rule using function notation.</p>
<p>\( B(n) = B(n-1) \times \frac{1}{2} \)</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Determine the initial condition or basis</p>
<p>\( B(1) = 80 \)</p>

<p><strong>Step 5</strong> - Determine the domain of the formula</p>
<p>We use the first term to find the second term, so that is where we start at \( n = 2 \). So, our domain is \( n \geq 2 \).</p>

<p>The recursive definition for 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 2.5, … is \( B(1) = 80 \), \( B(n) = B(n-1) \times \frac{1}{2} \), \( n \geq 2 \).</p>

<h5>Example 3</h5>
<br>
<p><strong>Sequence F:</strong> \(1, 3, 7, 15, 31, …\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Determine the type of sequence</p>
<p>This sequence is neither arithmetic nor geometric.</p>
