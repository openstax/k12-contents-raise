<h4>Factoring Quadratic Equations Without a Linear Term</h4>
<p>We can use what we have learned in the previous lesson to write quadratic equations of a special form into factored form.</p>
<p>Particularly, we can rewrite:</p>
<p>\(x^2&minus; c^2\) into \((x + c)(x &minus; c)\).</p>
<p>Let's look at an example.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Write \(v^2&minus;36\) in factored form.</p>
<p>We know that the form we are looking for is \((v\; &minus;\) __ \()(v \;+\) __ \()\).</p>
<p>Since we know the square <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="&ldquo;1.0&rdquo;" data-store="glossary-tooltip">root</span> of \(v^2\) is \(v\) and the square root of 36 is 6, the factored form is \((v &minus; 6)(v + 6)\).</p>
<p>We can multiply to check our work.</p>
<p>\((v &minus; 6)(v + 6)\)<br>
  \(\begin{array}{rcl}&amp;&amp;{=v^2+6v-6v-36\\=v^2-36\; {\style{color:red}\checkmark}}\\&amp;&amp;\end{array}\)</p>
<p>The process is similar when there is a coefficient on the squared term.</p>
<p>\(a^2x^2&minus;c^2\;\;\;\;\) factors into \(\;\;\;\;(ax + c)(ax &minus; c)\)</p>
<p>Let's look at another example to understand the process.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Write \(16m^2&minus; 81\) in factored form.</p>
<p>The form we are looking for now is ( __ &minus; __ )( __ + __ ).</p>
<p>Taking the square root of the first term gives us \(4m\).</p>
<p>So, we have \((4m\; &minus;\) __ \()(4m\; +\) __ \()\).</p>
<p>Now, we are in the same place as in the previous example. The square root of 81 is 9.</p>
<p>So, the factored form is \((4m &minus; 9 )(4m + 9)\).</p>
<p>Again, we can multiply to check.</p>
<p>\((4m &minus; 9)(4m + 9)\)<br>
  \(\begin{array}{rcl}&amp;&amp;{= 4m^2 + 36m &minus; 36m &minus; 81\\= 4m^2 &minus; 81\; {\style{color:red}\checkmark}}\\&amp;&amp;\end{array}\)</p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>
<p>As we see in the activity, where the variable is located is not important as long as the quadratic binomial is still the difference of two squares.</p>
<p>Write \(64 &minus; 9b^2\) in factored form.</p>
<p>We use the same concept to find the factored form.</p>
<p>\(64 &minus; 9b^2= (8 &minus; 3b)(8 + 3b)\)</p>
<p>We can multiply to check.</p>
<p>\((8 &minus; 3b)(8 + 3b)\)<br>
  \(\begin{array}{rcl}&amp;&amp;{= 64 + 24b &minus; 24b &minus; 9b^2\\= 64 &minus; 9b^2\; {\style{color:red}\checkmark}}\\&amp;&amp;\end{array}\)</p>
<p>Remember that any expression of the form \(x^2 + c\) or \(ax^2+ c\) does not have a factored form!</p>
<ul>
  <li> For \(x^2+ c\), the \(c\) is not squared, and the terms are not being subtracted. </li>
  <li> For \(ax^2+ c\), neither the \(a\) nor the \(c\) is a perfect square, and the terms are not being subtracted. </li>
</ul>
