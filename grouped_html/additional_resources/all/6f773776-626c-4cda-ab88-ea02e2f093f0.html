<h4>Using an Exponential Model</h4>
<p>A lab researcher records the growth of the population of a yeast colony and finds that the population doubles every hour. The table below records the first four hours.</p>

<p>The starting value is 5 (in thousands) and the population doubles, so the growth factor is 2.</p>
<p class="os-raise-text-bold">Example     </p>
<p>You can use the data you already have to predict the population size of the yeast colony in the future.        </p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
<li>What will the size of the population be in 5 hours? <br>
    The population will be 160,000. You will double the 80 which represents 80,000.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li>What will the size of the population be in 6 hours? <br>
    The population will be 320,000. You will double the 160 which represents 160,000. </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li>What will the size of the population be in 10 hours?<br>
    You may have to use a calculator to figure this one out.   You will double it four more times.   The population will be 5,120,000. </li>
</ol>

<p>The equation to model this growth is \(P(t)=5 \cdot 2^t\).</p>

    <p>A ball bounces up and down from a starting height of 65 centimeters. As it bounces, its height decreases to
  \(\frac13\) the previous height. Complete a table to represent the first 4 bounces.  Predict the height after 5 bounces. Then write a function, \(h(x)\),
  to determine the height after \(x\) bounces.</p>

  <p>The initial height is 65, and the growth factor is \(\frac13\).</p>
  <p>The height after the 5th bounce is \(\frac {65}{243}\)</p>
  <p>The maximum height, \(h(x)\), after \(x\) bounces can be represented by \(h(x)=65 (\frac{1}{3})^x\).</p>
