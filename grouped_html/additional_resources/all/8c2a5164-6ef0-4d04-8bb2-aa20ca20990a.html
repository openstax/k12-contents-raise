<p>Which had a greater average rate of change between 10.2 and 10.4 Sol, ground temperature or air temperature? What is the meaning of each rate change?</p>
<p>Since ground temperature has a greater slant or slope, it has a greater rate of change. Slope is another word for the rate of change of a graph.</p>
<p>To find the average rate of change, first you need to find Sol on the graph (which is what a day is called on Mars). Find the values of 10.2 and 10.4 on the \(x\)-axis. Find the corresponding \(y\)-values of the points for both the ground temperature and the air temperature graphs. By finding the average rate of change, you will be able to determine which one was greater.</p>
<p>Ground Temperature: \((10.2, -90)\) \((10.4, -20)\)</p>
<p>Air Temperature: \((10.2, -70 )\) \((10.4, -40)\)</p>
<p>Substitute each set of points into the average rate of change formula:</p>
<p>Ground Temperature = \(\frac{-20-(-90)}{10.4-10.2}=\frac{70}{0.2}=350\)</p>
<p>Air Temperature = \(\frac{-40-(-70)}{10.4-10.2}=\frac{30}{0.2}=150\)</p>
<p>Remember that to interpret the meaning of the rate of change, you need to compare the axes. It is the change in the \(y\)-axis units divided by the change in the \(x\)-axis units, or \(\frac{\mathrm{change}\;\mathrm{in}\;\mathrm{temperature}\;\mathrm{in}\;\mathrm{degrees}\;\mathrm{celsius}}{\mathrm{change}\;\mathrm{in}\;\mathrm{Sol}}\).&nbsp;That means that the average rate of change of each can be interpreted as:</p>
<p>Ground Temperature&rsquo;s average rate of change is 350 degrees celsius per Sol (or day on Mars).</p>
<p>Air Temperature&rsquo;s average rate of change is 150 degrees celsius per Sol (or day on Mars).</p>

  <p>Here is how to find the average rate of change:</p>
  <p>To find the average rate of change, first you need to find Sol on the graph (which is what a day is called on Mars). Find the values of 10.6 and 11 on the \(x\)-axis. Find the corresponding \(y\)-values of the points for both the ground temperature and air temperature graphs. By finding the average rate of change, you will be able to determine which one was greater.</p>
  <p>Ground Temperature: \((10.6, -3 )\) \((11, -85 )\)</p>
  <p>Air Temperature: \((10.6, -5 )\) \((11, -65 )\)</p>
  <p>Substitute each set of points into the average rate of change formula:</p>
  <p>Ground Temperature = \(\frac{-85-(-3)}{11-10.6}=\frac{-82}{0.4}=-205\)</p>
  <p>Air Temperature = \(\frac{-65-(-5)}{11-10.6}=\frac{-60}{0.4}=-150\)</p>
  <p>Remember that to interpret the meaning of the rate of change, you need to compare the axes.

That means that each average rate of change of each can be interpreted as:</p>
  <p>Ground temperature&rsquo;s average rate of change is &ndash;205 degrees celsius per Sol (or day on Mars).</p>
  <p>Air temperature&rsquo;s average rate of change is &ndash;150 degrees celsius per Sol (or day on Mars).</p>
  <p>The ground temperature had a greater rate of decrease per Sol.</p>
