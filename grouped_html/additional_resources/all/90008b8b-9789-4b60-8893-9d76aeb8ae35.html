<h4>Interpreting Graphs to Solve Quadratic Equations</h4>
<p>Let's analyze and interpret the graphs of different quadratic equations.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>First, let's look at the equation \((x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)=0\).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will graph the equation \(y=(x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)\).</p>
<p><img alt="GRAPH OF A PARABOLA THAT OPENS UP AND PASSES THROUGH THE POINTS (4, 0) AND (7, 0)." height="491" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/0f5ed86da7a118a883c063923369990eb0533368" width="491"></p>
<p>This graph has two \(x\)-intercepts.</p>
<p>The solutions to \((x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)=0\) are \(x\)-values that make the expression have a value of 0.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the \(x\)-intercepts, the \(y\)-value of the expression \((x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)\) is 0, so the \(x\)-intercepts give the solutions.</p>
<p>The \(x\)-intercepts and solutions to the equation are 4 and 7.</p>
<p>Note that the values of 4 and 7 could be referred to as <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">solutions</span> of the equation, <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">\(x\)-intercepts</span> of the graph, <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">roots</span> of the equation, or <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="1.0" data-store="glossary-tooltip">zeros</span> of the equation.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Let's look at a different example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\((x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)=&minus;2.25\) </p>
<p>First, we rewrite the equation to set it equal to 0.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\((x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)+2.25=0\)</p>
<p>We will graph the equation \(y=(x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)+2.25\).</p>
<p><img alt="GRAPH OF A PARABOLA THAT OPENS UP WITH A VERTEX AT (5.5, 0)." height="461" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/1ef50a1728e0a8b372ea2439ea5d09509bbc8ad0" width="461"></p>
<p>This graph has one \(x\)-intercept. It is an example of a double root at 5.5. A <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="&ldquo;1.0&rdquo;" data-store="glossary-tooltip">double root</span> is a root that appears twice in the solution of an algebraic equation.</p>
<p>The solution is the \(x\)-coordinate of the \(x\)-intercept.</p>
<p>So, the solution to \((x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)=&minus;2.25\) is 5.5.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>
<p>Let's look at one last example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\((x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)=-5\)</p>
<p>First, we rewrite the equation to set it equal to 0.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\((x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)+5=0\)</p>
<p>We will graph the equation \(y=(x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)+5\).</p>
<p><img alt="GRAPH OF A PARABOLA THAT OPENS UP. THE GRAPH DOES NOT TOUCH OR CROSS THE X-AXIS. THE GRAPH PASSES THROUGH THE POINTS (4, 5) AND (7, 5)." height="492" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/e1476e86da83ad0dfeb849b8243cc69255d2cb33" width="492"></p>
<p>The graph has no \(x\)-intercepts.</p>
<p>So, there are no real solutions for \((x&minus;4)(x&minus;7)+5=0\).</p>
<p>Remember, when a <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="&ldquo;1.0&rdquo;" data-store="glossary-tooltip">quadratic expression</span> is equal to 0 and we want to find the unknown values, we can think of it as finding the zeros of a <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="&ldquo;1.0&rdquo;" data-store="glossary-tooltip">quadratic function</span>, or finding the \(x\)-intercepts of the graph of that <span class="os-raise-ib-tooltip" data-schema-version="&ldquo;1.0&rdquo;" data-store="glossary-tooltip">function</span>.</p>

  <p>Here is how to analyze the graph of the equation to find any solutions:</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Rewrite the equation to set it equal to 0. </p>
  <p>  \((x&minus;4)(x&minus;9)+6.25=0\) </p>
  <p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Graph the equation \(y=(x&minus;4)(x&minus;9)+6.25\). </p>

  <p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Identify the \(x\)-intercepts from the graph. </p>
  <p>  There is one \(x\)-intercept at \((6.5, 0)\)</p>
  <p>  This means there is one solution.</p>
  <p>  The solution is 6.5. </p>
