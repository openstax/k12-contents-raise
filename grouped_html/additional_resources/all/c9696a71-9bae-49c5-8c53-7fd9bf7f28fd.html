<h4>Finding Intercepts from Graphs and Equations</h4>

      <p>The points where a line crosses the \( x \)-axis and the \( y \)-axis are called the intercepts of the line.</p>
   
      <p>Let&rsquo;s look at the graphs of the lines.</p>
   
    <img alt="The figure shows four graphs of different equations. In example a the graph of 2 x plus y plus 6 is graphed on the x y-coordinate plane. The x and y axes run from negative 8 to 8. The points (0, 6) and (3, 0) are plotted and labeled. A straight line goes through both points and has arrows on both ends. In example b the graph of 3 x minus 4 y plus 12 is graphed on the x y-coordinate plane. The x and y axes run from negative 8 to 8. The points (0, negative 3) and (4, 0) are plotted and labeled. A straight line goes through both points and has arrows on both ends. In example c the graph of x minus y plus 5 is graphed on the x y-coordinate plane. The x and y axes run from negative 8 to 8. The points (0, negative 5) and (5, 0) are plotted and labeled. A straight line goes through both points and has arrows on both ends. In example d the graph of y plus negative 2 x is graphed on the x y-coordinate plane. The x and y axes run from negative 8 to 8. The point (0, 0) is plotted and labeled. A straight line goes through this point and the points (negative 1, 2) and (1, negative 2) and has arrows on both ends." class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" height="716" src="https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/fe7c894af22fc816272cc2a3a72e056a1da78b83" width="643">
