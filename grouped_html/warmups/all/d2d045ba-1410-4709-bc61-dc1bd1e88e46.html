<p>A customer at a bagel shop is buying 13 bagels. The store worker says, &ldquo;That would be $16.25.&rdquo;<br>
Jaime, Pedro, and Hannah, who are in the shop, all think it is a mistake.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jaime says, &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t the total be $13.25?&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Pedro says, &ldquo;I think it should be $13.00.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Hannah says, &ldquo;No, I think it should be $11.25.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider how the store worker, Jaime, Pedro, and Hannah could all be right.
</p>


<p>In the following activity, you will be asked to use the pricing information displayed at the bagel shop to determine who is correct about the pricing for 13 bagels. </p>
