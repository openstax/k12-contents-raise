<ul>
<li>Each scoop of ice cream costs $0.75 and the cost of each topping is $1.50 which sum to the cost of one bowl of ice cream. Now we multiply the cost of one bowl of ice cream by the number of students in the class. </li>
<li>A flat cost of $4 per bowl of ice cream for each student plus a charge of $15 for the bowls, spoons, and napkins.</li>
<li>There are \(n\) students in the ninth grade. A packaged ice cream cone is about $1.50, and tax is about 8%.</li>
<li>There are 125 students in the ninth grade. Suppose a tub of ice cream costs $5 and is enough for 6 students. A pack of 24 cones costs about $3, and 6 packs are needed. A pack of 150 paper napkins costs \(p\) dollars.</li>
