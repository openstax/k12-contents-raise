<p>Since the vertex is \((-3, -5)\) and one point on the curve is \((5, 61)\), there is another point on the other
    side of the vertex. Keep in mind, the \(y\)-coordinate will remain at 61. To find the \(x\)-coordinate, we need to
    determine how far apart horizontally the vertex and the other point are located from each other. There are 8 units
    from -3 to 5, so the new point will also be 8 units from -3 but to the left. Thus, the \(x\)-coordinate will be at

<p>Here is how to solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:</p>
<p>Solve by using the quadratic formula: \(2x^2+10x+11=0\).</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - This equation is in standard form. <br/>
    \({\style{color:red}a}{\style{color:red}x}^{\style{color:red}2}\;{\style{color:red}+}\;{\style{color:red}b}{\style{color:red}x}\;{\style{color:red}+}\;{\style{color:red}c}\;{\style{color:red}=}\;{\style{color:red}0}\) <br/>
    \(2x^2+10x+11=0\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Identify the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). <br/>
    \(a=2\), \(b=10\), \(c=11\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Write the quadratic formula. <br/>
    \(x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2- 4ac}}{2a}\) </p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Then substitute in the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). <br/>
    Substitute in: <br/>
    \({\style{color:blue}a}\;{\style{color:blue}=}\;{\style{color:blue}2}\), \({\style{color:red}b}\;{\style{color:red}=}\;{\style{color:red}1}{\style{color:red}0}\), \({\style{color:green}c}\;{\style{color:green}=}\;{\style{color:green}1}{\style{color:green}1}\)</p>

<p><strong>Step 5</strong> - Simplify. <br/>
    \(x=\frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{100-88}}{4}\) <br/>

    The vertex is halfway between the zeros. Since \(\frac{-1}{16}\) is near 0 and the other \(x\)-intercept is at 6, we can use 3 as an estimate for the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex.</p>

 A relationship between quantities
  can be described in more than one way. Some ways are more helpful than
  others, depending on what we want to find out. Let‚Äôs look at the angles
  of an isosceles triangle, for example.
</p>
<div class=""os-raise-d-flex os-raise-justify-content-between"">
 <img alt=""Triangle with angles labeled a, b, and a."" src=""https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/4dd78e58c323915d1b1394785533170a4ef8149b""/>
 <p>
  The two angles near the horizontal side
  <br/>
  have equal measurement in degrees, \(a\).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sum of angles in a triangle is
  <br/>
  \(180\circ\) , so the relationship between
  <br/>
  the angles can be expressed as:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  \(a+a+b=180\)
 </p>
</div>
<p>
 <strong>
  Example 1
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Suppose we want to find \(a\) when \(b\) is \(20^\circ\).
</p>
<p>
 \( a+a+b=180 \)
 <br/>
 \( 2a+20=180 \)
 <br/>
 \( 2a=180-20 \)
 <br/>
 \( 2a=160 \)
</p>
<p>
 \( a=80 \)
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Example 2
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 What is the value of \(b\) if \(a\) is \(72.5^\circ\)?
</p>
<p>
 \( a+a+b=180 \)
 <br/>
 \( 72.5+72.5+b=80 \)
 <br/>
 \( 145+b=180 \)
 <br/>
 \( b=35 \)
</p>
<p>
 Notice that when \(b\) is given, we did the same calculation repeatedly to find \(a\): We substituted \(b\) into the
  first equation, subtracted \(b\) from 180, and then divided the result by 2.
</p>
<p>
 Instead of taking these steps over and over whenever we know \( b \)
  and want to find \( a \), we can rearrange the equation to isolate
  \( a \):
</p>
<p>
 \( a+a+b=180 \)
 <br/>
 \( 2a+b=180 \)
 <br/>
 \( 2a=180-b \)
 <br/>
 \( a=\frac{180-b}{2} \)
 <br/>
 \( a=90-\frac{1}{2}b \)
</p>
<p>
 This equation is equivalent to the first one. To find \( a \), we can
  now simply substitute any value of \( b \) into this equation and
  evaluate the expression on the right side.
</p>
<p>
 Likewise, we can write an equivalent equation to make it easier to find \( b \) when we know \( a \):
</p>
<p>
 \( a+a+b=180 \)
 <br/>
 \( 2a+b=180 \)
 <br/>
 \( b=180-2a \)
</p>
<p>
 Rearranging an equation to isolate one variable is called solving for
  a variable. In this example, we have solved for \( a \) and for
  \( b \). All three equations are equivalent. Depending on what
  information we have and what we are interested in, we can choose a
  particular equation to use.

 Equivalent equations are equations that have the same solutions. They are often found by using inverse operations or by multiplying each term in the equation by the same value.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Example
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Write three equivalent equations to \(4x - 2 = 8\) using one of three strategies.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Using an inverse operation
 </li>
 <li>
  Using division
 </li>
 <li>
  Using multiplication
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 <strong>
  Using an inverse operation:
 </strong>
 <br/>
 An equivalent equation can be determined by adding 2 to both sides.
</p>
<p>
 \(4x - 2 = 8\)
 <br/>
 \(4x - 2 + 2 = 8 + 2\)
 <br/>
 \(4x = 10\)
 <br/>
 \((4x - 2 = 8)\) and \((4x = 10)\) are equivalent.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Using division:
 </strong>
 <br/>
 An equivalent equation can be determined by dividing by 2 (or multiplying by \(\frac12\)).
</p>
<p>
 \(4x - 2 = 8\)
 <br/>
 \((\frac{1}{2})(4x - 2) = (\frac{1}{2}) (8)\)
 <br/>
 \(2x - 1 = 4\)
</p>
<p>
 \((4x - 2 = 8)\) and \((2x - 1 = 4)\) are equivalent.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Using multiplication:
 </strong>
 <br/>
 An equivalent equation can be determined by multiplying the same number to both sides.

 Here‚Äôs how to find the slope of a line from its graph using \(m=\frac{\mathrm{rise}}{\mathrm{run}}\).
</p>
<div class=""os-raise-graybox"">
 <strong>
  Finding Slope from a Graph
 </strong>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Step 1
  </strong>
  - Locate two points on the line whose coordinates are integers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Step 2
  </strong>
  - Starting with one point, sketch a right triangle, going from the first point to the second point.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Step 3
  </strong>
  - Count the rise and the run on the legs of the triangle.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Step 4
  </strong>
  - Take the ratio of rise to run to find the slope: \(m=\frac{\mathrm{rise}}{\mathrm{run}}\).
 </p>
</div>
<br/>
<p>
 <strong>
  Example 1
 </strong>
</p>
<br/>
<p>

</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Step 1
 </strong>
 - Locate two points on the line whose coordinates are integers.
 <br/>
 \((0,5)\) and \((3,3)\)
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Step 2
 </strong>
 - Starting with one point, sketch a right triangle, going from the first point to the second point.
</p>

</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Step 3
 </strong>
 - Count the rise and the run on the legs of the triangle.
 <br/>
 The rise is -2.
 <br/>
 The run is 3.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Step 4
 </strong>
 - Take the ratio of rise to run to find the slope: \(m=\frac{\mathrm{rise}}{\mathrm{run}}\).
</p>
<p>
 \(m=-\frac23\)
</p>
<p>
 Here‚Äôs how to find the slope of a line when given two points on the line.
</p>
<br/>
<div class=""os-raise-graybox"">
 <strong>
  Finding Slope from Two Points
 </strong>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Step 1
  </strong>
  - Label the points (\(x_1, y_1)\) and (\(x_2, y_2)\).
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Step 2
  </strong>
  - Substitute the values into the slope formula: \(m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\)
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Step 3
  </strong>
  - Simplify the slope expression.
 </p>
</div>
<br/>
<p>
 <strong>
  Example 2
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Use the slope formula to find the slope of the line through the points \((-2,-3)\) and \((-7,4)\).
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Step 1
 </strong>
 - Label the points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\).
</p>
<p>
 \((-2,-3)\) \((-7,4)\)
</p>
<p>
 \((x_1, y_1)\) \((x_2,y_2)\)
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Step 2
 </strong>
 - Substitute into the slope formula.
</p>
<p>
 \(m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{4-(-3)}{-7-(-2)}\)
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Step 3
 </strong>
 - Simplify
</p>
<p>
 \(m=\frac{4-(-3)}{-7-(-2)}=\frac{4+3}{-7+2}=\frac{7}{-5}\)

 <br/>
 Suppose Tyler spends $45 on T-shirts and socks. A T-shirt costs $10, and a pair of socks costs $2.50. If \(t\)
  represents the number of T-shirts and \(p\) represents the number of pairs of socks that Tyler buys, we can

<li> Rewriting it in standard form gives \(-5t^2+25t-15=0\). The expression on the left side of the equation cannot be written in factored form, however. </li>
<li> Completing the square isn't convenient because the coefficient of the squared term is not a perfect square and the coefficient for the linear term is an odd number. </li>
<li> Let's use the quadratic formula, using \(a=-5\), \(b=25\), and \(c = -15\)! </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - \(t=\frac {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2- 4ac}}{2a}\)</p>

 Each point on the line is a pair of \( x \)- and \( y \)-values that make the equation true and is thus a solution. It is also a pair of values that satisfy the constraints in the situation.

  The point \( (10, 200) \) is on the line. If we buy 10 pounds of beans and 200 pounds of rice, the cost will be \( 2(10) + 0.50(200) \), which equals 120.

<p>Compare your answer:</p>
<p>Here is how to check the table to see if it represents an exponential relationship:</p>
<p>Just like the values of a graph, you can divide consecutive terms to find the growth factor. If each set of consecutive terms has the same ratio, the relationship is exponential. In this situation, dividing consecutive terms results in \(\frac{600}{300}=\frac{1200}{600}=\frac{2400}{1200}=2\). Therefore, the situation represents exponential growth and can also be represented by the equation \(y= 300(2)^x\), where \(y\) is the number of people who have read a book and \(x\) is the number of months.</p>

What is the meaning of each rate change?</p><br/><p>Write down your answer, then select the <strong>solution</strong> button to compare your work.
    </p>","
<p>Here is how to find the average rate of change:</p>
<p>To find the average rate of change, first you need to find Sol on the graph (which is what a day is called on Mars). Find the values of 10.6 and 11 on the \(x\)-axis. Find the corresponding \(y\)-values of the points for both the ground temperature and air temperature graphs. By finding the average rate of change, you will be able to determine which one was greater.</p>
<p>Ground Temperature: \((10.6, -3 )\) \((11, -85 )\)</p>
<p>Air Temperature: \((10.6, -5 )\) \((11, -65 )\)</p>
<p>Substitute each set of points into the average rate of change formula:</p>
<p>Ground Temperature = \(\frac{-85-(-3)}{11-10.6}=\frac{-82}{0.4}=-205\)</p>
<p>Air Temperature = \(\frac{-65-(-5)}{11-10.6}=\frac{-60}{0.4}=-150\)</p>
<p>Remember that to interpret the meaning of the rate of change, you need to compare the axes. It is the change in the \(y\)-axis units divided by the change in the \(x\)-axis units, or \(\frac{\mathrm{change}\;\mathrm{in}\;\mathrm{temperature}\;\mathrm{in}\;\mathrm{degrees}\;\mathrm{celsius}}{\mathrm{change}\;\mathrm{in}\;\mathrm{Sol}}\). That means that each average rate of change of each can be interpreted as:</p>
<p>Ground temperature‚Äôs average rate of change is ‚Äì205 degrees celsius per Sol (or day on Mars).</p>
<p>Air temperature‚Äôs average rate of change is ‚Äì150 degrees celsius per Sol (or day on Mars).</p>
<p>The ground temperature had a greater rate of decrease per Sol.</p>

<p>Compare your answer:</p>
<p>Here is how to determine which table is exponential growth:</p>
<p>When looking for exponential growth, remember that each \(y\)-value should be greater than the previous one. By
    first checking for growth, you can eliminate Table B and Table D. In Table B, each term is less than the first one,
    so it is not exponential growth. In Table D, the values increase and decrease, so it is not exponential growth,
    either.</p>
<p>Next, check for connections between consecutive terms. In Table A, \(2+6= 8\) and \(2 \cdot 4=8\). Since there
    seems to be the possibility of either a linear relationship or exponential growth, you need to check the next set of
    terms. Since \(8 \cdot 4 \neq 14\) and \(8+6 =14\), the relationship in Table A is linear, not exponential.¬†
  </p>
<p>This means the answer should be Table C, but we should always check to confirm. If we check consecutive terms in
    Table C for a growth factor, we get the following: \(\frac {16}{4}=4\), \(\frac{64}{16}=4\), and
    \(\frac{256}{64}=4\). This proves that the growth factor is 4 and Table C represents exponential growth.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs how to solve an inequality using a table:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Create a table of values using the related equation \(y = 2x + 3\) to identify points on the boundary line of the inequality.</p>
<table class=""os-raise-skinnytable"">
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope=""col"">x</th>

<td>7</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br/>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Plot the points and sketch the boundary line.</p>
<p>If the inequality is \(\leq\) or \(\geq\), the boundary line is solid.</p>
<p>If the inequality is \(&lt;\) or \(&gt;\), the boundary line is dashed.</p>
<p>The inequality sign is , so we draw a solid line.</p>
<p><img src=""https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/341d1376d80f11af33d4dedb611828816f5d0fb9"" width=""300""/></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Test a point that is not on the boundary line. Is it a solution of the inequality?</p>
<p>Test \((0, 0)\) as it is not on the boundary line of the inequality.</p>
<p>\(y  \leq 2x + 3\)</p>
<p>\((0)  \stackrel {?}{\leq} 2(0) + 3\)</p>
<p>\(0  \leq 3\) is True.</p>
<p>So, (0, 0) is a solution.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Shade in one side of the boundary line.</p>
<p>If the test point is a solution, shade in the side that includes the point.</p>
<p>If the test point is not a solution, shade in the opposite side.</p>
<p>The test point \((0, 0)\) is a solution, so shade in the side of the boundary line that includes \((0, 0)\).</p>

<p>All points in the shaded region and not on the boundary line represent the solutions to \(y  \leq 2x + 3\).</p>

 Plotting these data suggests that there may be a trend. We can see from the trend in the data that as the number of chirps increases every 15 seconds, the temperature increases. The trend appears to be roughly linear, though certainly not perfectly so.
</p>
<br/>

<p>
 Once we recognize a need for a linear function to model that data, the natural follow-up question is: ‚ÄúWhat is that linear function?‚Äù One way to approximate our linear function is to sketch the line that seems to best fit the data. Then we can extend the line until we can verify the \(y\)-intercept. We can approximate the slope of the line by extending it until we can estimate the \(\frac{rise}{run}\).
</p>
<strong>
 Continuing the Example: Finding a Line of Best Fit
 <br/>
</strong>
<br/>
<p>
 Find a linear function that fits the data above by ‚Äúeyeballing‚Äù a line that seems to fit.
</p>
<p>
 On a graph, we could try sketching a line. Using the starting and ending points of our hand-drawn line, points \((0, 30)\) and \((50, 90)\), this graph has a slope of \(m\;=\;\frac{60}{50}\;=\;1.2\) and a \(y\)-intercept at 30.
</p>
<p>
 The slope means that for every increase of 1 chirp per 15 seconds, the temperature increases 1.2 degrees.
</p>
<p>
 The \(y\)-intercept stands for the temperature needed for crickets to start chirping.

<p>
 Different methods of making predictions are used to analyze data. The method of interpolation involves predicting a value inside the domain and/or range of the data. The method of extrapolation involves predicting a value outside the domain and/or range of the data.
</p>
<p>
 Model breakdown occurs at the point when the model no longer applies.
</p>
<p class=""os-raise-text-bold"">
 Continuing the Example: Understanding Interpolation and Extrapolation
</p>
<p>
 Use the cricket data from the table to answer the following questions:
</p>
<ol class=""os-raise-noindent"">
 <ol class=""os-raise-noindent"">
  <li>
   Would predicting the temperature when crickets are chirping 30 times in 15 seconds be interpolation or extrapolation? Make the prediction and discuss whether it is reasonable.
  </li>
  <li>
   Would predicting the number of chirps crickets will make at 40 degrees be interpolation or extrapolation? Make the prediction and discuss whether it is reasonable.
  </li>
 </ol>
</ol>
<p>
 <strong>
  Solution:
 </strong>
 <br/>
</p>
<ol class=""os-raise-noindent"">
 <li>
  The number of chirps in the data provided varied from 18.5 to 44. A prediction at 30 chirps per 15 seconds is inside the domain of our data, so it would be interpolation. Using our model:
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 \(\begin{array}{rcl}T(30)&amp;=&amp;30+1.2(30)\\&amp;=&amp;66\;degrees\end{array}\)
</p>
<p>
 Based on the data we have, this value seems reasonable.
</p>
<br/>
<ol class=""os-raise-noindent"" start=""2"">
 <li>
  The temperature values varied from 52 to 80.5. Predicting the number of chirps at 40 degrees is extrapolation because 40 is outside the range of our data. Using our model:
 </li>
</ol>
<div>
 <p>
  \(\begin{array}{rcl}40\;&amp;=&amp;\;30\;+\;1.2c\\10\;&amp;=&amp;\;1.2c\\c\;&amp;\approx&amp;\;8.33\end{array}\)
 </p>
</div>
<p>
 We can compare the regions of interpolation and extrapolation using the following figure.

<p>The function \(f(x)=x^2\) is the parent function for quadratics. For \(f(x)=x^2+3\) , when 3 is added to \(f(x)=x^2\), the graph shifts up 3 units. This shift occurs because the value of 3 is being added to the output of the \(x^2\) function. Thus, the shift is seen vertically because it affects the output values.</p>

<p>Here is how to match a graph and its equation:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Find the vertex.<br/>
    \((1, 2)\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Does the parabola open up or down?<br/>
    Up ‚Äî this means the leading coefficient is positive.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Use the vertex form of the equation and write the parts you know: the coordinates of the vertex.<br/>
    \(y=a(x-1)^2+2\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - To solve for \(a\), find another point on the graph of the parabola and plug in those values for \(x\) and \(y\) in the equation you wrote.<br/>
    \((0, 3)\) is also on the graph of this parabola. So, \(3=a(0-1)^2+2\).</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> - Solve for \(a\).<br/>
    \(3=a(0-1)^2+2\)</p>
<p>\(3=a(-1)^2+2\)</p>
<p>\(3=a+2\)<br/>
    \(1=a\)</p>

    \(y=1(x-1)^2+2\)<br/>
    \(y=(x-1)^2+2\)<br/>

<p>Here is how to identify the exponential constant ratio of a table:</p>
<p>First, make sure the table is reflecting an exponential relationship by noticing how quickly the terms grow. Then, if the \(x\) values are increasing by 1, divide consecutive terms to determine the growth factor.</p>
<p>Since \(20\div 10=2\), \(40\div 20=2\), and \(80\div 40=2\), the growth factor is 2.</p>

<p>Here is how to determine the pattern of a sequence with a graph:</p>
<p>First, make a table:</p>
<table class=""os-raise-horizontaltable"">
<thead></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th scope=""row"">Term</th>
<td>
          1
        </td>
<td>
          2
        </td>
<td>
          3
        </td>
<td>
          4
        </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope=""row"">Value</th>
<td>
          1
        </td>
<td>
          3
        </td>
<td>
          9
        </td>
<td>
          127
        </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br/>
<p>Next, plot the points:</p>
<p><img alt=""GRAPH SHOWING PLOTTED POINTS (1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 9), AND (4, 27)."" src=""https://k12.openstax.org/contents/raise/resources/9e69225cf486825f1b31d8331149e987257b2600"" width=""300""/></p>
<p>Each point is 3 times the height of the previous point.</p>
<p>Notice that in the sequence, each term is 3 times the previous term.</p>

 Graph the following sequence and explain the pattern.
