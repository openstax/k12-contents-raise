<p>Why do you think the graph of function \(f\) looks the way it does? Why are there two parts that split at \(x=2\), with one curving down as it approaches \(x=2\) from the left and the other curving up as it approaches \(x=2\) from the right? </p>
<p>Evaluate function \(f\) at different \(x\)-values that approach 2 but are not exactly 2, such as 1.8, 1.9, 1.95, 1.999, 2.2, 2.1, 2.05, 2.001, and so on.

<ul>
<li>When \(x\) is less than 2, as it gets closer to 2 (from the left side), the denominator in 6x-2becomes a smaller and smaller negative value, so the quotient, \(f(x)\), gets larger and larger in the negative direction. It does so very quickly, which explains why the curve bends down rather dramatically. </li>
<li>When \(x\) is greater than 2, as it approaches 2 (from the right side), the denominator in \(6x-2\) becomes a smaller and smaller positive value, so \(f(x)\) gets larger and larger in the positive direction. It does so very quickly as well, which explains the graph shooting up if we trace it from right to left. </li>
<li>The expression \(6x-2\) undefined at \(x=2\) and we can see that the two pieces of the graph shoot off in opposite directions as x approaches 2 from the left and from the right, which explains the gap at \(x=2\). </li>

<p>Compare your answer:</p>
<p>\(x^2+5x\) is equivalent to \(x(x+5)\), so the \(x\)-intercepts are at \(x=0\) and \(x=-5\). Calculate the vertex by finding the \(x\)-coordinate in between \(x = -5\) and \(x = 0\) which is \(x = -2.5\). Substitute \(x=-2.5\) into the equation to find the \(y\)-coordinate: \(y=(-2.5)2+5(-2.5)=-6.188\). The vertex is at \((-2.5, -6.188)\). The squared term has a positive coefficient so the graph opens upward. Adding a positive linear term to \(x^2\) shifts the graph down and to the left.</p>

 To prepare for a backyard party, a parent uses two identical hoses to fill a small pool that is 15 inches deep and a large pool that is 27 inches deep.
</p>
<p>
 The height of the water in each pool is a function of time since the water is turned on.

<p>No, these boundaries are not suitable for graphing this function.</p>
<ul>
<li>Horizontal axis: There is probably no medicine left in the body 100 hours after injection, so it is not helpful to graph all the way to an \(h\) value of 100. And if there was any medicine in the body before injection, it wouldn’t be accounted for by this equation, so \(h\) should probably start at 0. 
    </li>
<li>Vertical axis: The medicine is decreasing in amount, starting from 20 milligrams, so 1,000 for the upper end of the axis is far too large. The negative values for 𝑚 are also not needed because a negative amount of medicine would not make any sense here.

    probably not reliable because it could have been a very small bounce height, which would be difficult to measure).
